            "[' the people and events portrayed in this movie are incredible marvel films generally require you to believe in an alternate reality in which aliens and advanced technology exist once you believe in that reality for the duration of the movie people and events portrayed in the movie make sense not so with this movie you will know early on when regular human being survives fall from 10 story building without scratch hitting at least three balconies with their back on the way down because don want to spoil anything else m limiting myself to this example but the list of unbelievably unbelievable events is very long also we re back at the tone of the original cap film in which small team of americans can successfully invade ultra high security nazi facility because apparently nazis can aim gun in black widow russians are given the american superiority complex treatment they occasionally speak russian but russian friend couldn understand what they said when they did fortunately they use ienglisj wiz verri stronk aksent for the rest of the movie unless an actor temporarily forgets and sounds american for half sentence which happens regularly they re all megalomaniacs and pretty much all losers commented on facebook thread how black widow depicts russians that was flagged as hate speech find that absolutely hilarious bonus points for being able to look at florence for long time and for staying away from requiring the female actors to appear in underwear at least once ', ' there was so much hype about the concept of this film that guess people built an image of perfect marvel natasha film for good reason as the character was with us for like decade the creators of the film decided to do this one winter soldier nikita style where it would feel like you are watching bond style film the concept of rogue agent bringing down an organization is pretty old so the film doesn feel extremely fresh while there are some decent action scenes there is an abundance of content that would betted be left out for the film sake overall this is not as terrible as thor the dark world so you can watch this once like men origins wolverine and forget what it was about ', ' this series is colorful very colorful okay that something else but in the end marvel and disney can get over having to politicize everything and everyone this series is less reminiscent of contribution to the mcu than kitachy clich nickeoden series by now we re on episode 2 and nothing happens absolutely nothing instead you get bogged down in dull teen love issues social ethnic nonsense and forgetting to let the whole thing pick up speed for most of the time it all pretty annoying ', ' black widow is an action sci fi movie in which we watch natasha romanoff aka black widow facing her past and trying to confront dangerous conspiracy before it too late she is also forced not only to face her past but also to close some unfinished business enjoyed this movie because it contained many good action scenes that were combined very well with comedy the plot was interesting and not boring while the visual effects gave beautiful touch in the movie and lifted even more the direction which was made by cate shortland was good and she did nice job on the way she presented the story behind natasha romanoff the interpretations of both scarlett johansson who played as natasha romanoff and florence pugh who played as yelena belova were very good and their combination worked very well too rachel weisz who played as melina and david harbour who played as alexei gave different touch in the movie and also helped to the evolution of the main characters to sum up have to say that if you are fan of marvel then am definitely sure that you will love black widow but even if you are not this movie is good opportunity for you to become ', ' loved this show to death thought jon bernthal did fantastic job as puinsher always skip first season of daredevil so can get closer to second season was curious where is puinsher show on it own am die hard fan of puinsher love puinsher 1989 dolph lundgren yes understand he doesn wear skull because in 80 they had different comic books in 60 and 70 puinsher wear costume like batman black rubber costume witch it looks bad the comics weren noting like the one in 2004 puinsher and puinsher war zone noting like that but in olden days comics puinsher didn wear shirt or bulletproof vest of skull in it so studios from 1989 puinsher said nope don put skull costume on because it will look pretty bad because in 80 they had bad technology and bad design for costumes like tim button batman film 2004 loved that movie different puinsher thomas jane did great job as puinsher marvel tryed million times to get thomas jane back as puinsher witch everyone loved loved it too but he didn wanna comeback in 2009 puinsher war zone witch he thought story script was rubbish then when netflix made daredevil season 2 they even try to get back thomas jane puinsher am like wow yes do that but he didn like script am ok expect wished puinsher dirty laundry was budget movie don wear he slipped into that but anyway it shame 2009 puinsher war zone was still fun movie it still frank castle killing lot of bad guys thought liked when they made it into different style of puinsher ray stevenson is ok but wished they hired different actor rather then ray stevenson sadly but movie got upset reviews but loved puinsher war zone 10 years later this puinsher netflix is great loved it jon bernthal scary character just like one with lundgren and jane characters jon bernathal nailed his character can imagine someone else can play puinsher like frank grillo is great perfect fit for puinsher just like in purge anarchy but was fine with jon bernathal show is full on violence great action thought their was lot of fun episodes lot of brutal kills it violent just like with another puinsher movies story takes place frank castle comes home from war and he spent time with his family in horse riding some of guys comes in kills him and his family he survived it he becomes puinsher then story is beginning of daredevil season 2 then story from this show continues then this after defenders thought frank castle character was person you don want to mess with he is scary guy you don want even put finger in him their is lot of high body counts in this show villains main villain was lot more different actor the chronicles of narnia prince caspian ben barnes billy russo jigsaw comparing his character with puinsher war zone dominic west character now in this show billy is different character to one in puinsher war zone 2009 thought billy russo jigsaw is good character in show noting much to say about villains rawlins paul schulze actor from 2008 rambo 4th film thought his villain is eh noting special about rawlins his character is like you want him to do die badly you will hate him action is fun puinsher kicked lot of asses shooting up bad guys killing them brutally frank castle finds character who is hacker david linus microchip lieberman ebon moss bachrach who has skills to building weapons supplying technology and providing friendship in more recent publications microchip gradually evolved from the punisher friend to bitter enemy originally character was wayne knight in puinsher war zone so now it involves characters from puinsher war zone thing got disappointing is when frank castle throws away his puinsher skull away in very first episode he throws it away then in action he doesn wear almost towards 2 of end of episodes he puts it back on like in 10 or 11 or 12 put in episodes 13 he wears it full on in daredevil season 2 got disappointed little of it frank doesn wear skull until end of show of daredevil in this thought he wears skull in this show lot more witch he doesn wear lot people like jon bernathal not giving him noting just nailed his character but everyone is giving crap to dolph lundgren puinsher 1989 ok their was reason but funny in daredevil season 2 why didn wear skull why in this show he throws it way then he wear it until towards of episode 11 or 12 episodes wanted to see frank castle wearing skull in this show lot more in punisher war zone he even wears skull lot more then this sadly but doesn ruin show noting made me disappointed thought another characters dinah madani amber rose revah was ok she is working with cia car chase between frank and dinah was great scene and yes of crouse their is karen page deborah ann woll in show can see theirs relationship together but don know how to put it this is worth it this show is so worth it it greatest marvel character without superpowers no cgi superpowers puinsher kills to punish he doesn need any superpowers he needs to punish crimes brutal and violently perfect this is show highly recommended watch it it great show ', ' it a terrible show and most of the reviews for this shows are spot on if you re thinking to watch this show please avoid it ', ' ms marvel is awful could not stay interested in this show at all the acting is awful the action is awful and the direction of the story doesn add anything to the mcu why ms marvel she has nothing to do with the multiverse or the kang the conqueror story line why not just throw adam brashear in there too it makes no sense the mcu is dead ', ' this was my favorite one out of all of them so far out of all the marvel movies ve seen it twice already midnight showing then the first one in the morning and both time i jumped laughed and had fantastic time watching it have few tips before you check it out tip one is is wait for after all the credits there will be less then minute of them then something then there will be like 5 minutes of them then something again tip two make sure you either know the comics or have seen all the movies of marvel because if not you will most likely get lost only thing is wish they would have had is spiderman in the movie not huge deal but still who does not love him overall would give it 10 out of 10 stars because of the action laughter and everything else that comes along with it ', ' only saw 2 episodes and the first one still found out okay but then before watched the second was still hesitating to see so looked at it thought it was so bad that grab my cell phone have known marvel for years and think this series was bit strange for marvel always like japanese seriers but for this one from marvel really didn like to watch it that why it only 1 sorry marvel ', ' didn hear much about this how when it came out honestly didn even bother watching it but picked it up before no way home when daredevil was rumored it turned out to be one of the best choices ve made as this show is amazing the action is great the story is great one of the best things marvel has made so far ', ' ms marvel swings into the marvel cinematic universe with promising debut introducing iman vellani as the charismatic kamala khan the acting showcases vellani charm and enthusiasm bringing authenticity to the character of teenage superhero navigating her newfound powers the film editing while attempting to capture the fast paced and dynamic nature of kamala adventures occasionally feels bit uneven the strength lies in the film commitment to diverse representation and the relatable coming of age story at its core however the weakness can be found in the occasional moments where the narrative feels constrained by its superhero formula the music although not groundbreaking complements the youthful energy of the character with 6 10 rating ms marvel plants the seeds for an exciting new superhero journey albeit with some room for growth and refinement ', ' brie larson is underutilized in marvel film that revels in 90s nostalgia but successful to rise to the occasion of its own relevance superheroes regularly save the world but their films are nearly as brave for every inventive black panther that deviates from the billion dollar template ten timid time wasters are produced captain marvel the marvel cinematic universe first female led film holds lot of symbolic significance particularly for young girls who identify with gal gadot bold portrayal of wonder woman but you can help but wish the watershed moment was accompanied by more vividly envisioned lead figure even within the mcu there are fiercer more complex women to be found elizabeth olsen tortured scarlet witch comes to mind and while room and short term 12 star brie larson is certainly capable of expressing guilty uncertainty she a little stranded in the cosmic matters playing role that gives her scant opportunity to be human it appears to be beneath her role that a big deal because captain marvel co written by mississippi grind directors anna boden and ryan fleck plus an army of story writers tries hard to dazzle you with its originality that effort is sometimes too obvious as in the film absolutely superfluous first 20 minutes which introduces planet hala the kree the supreme intelligence the nefarious skrull maybe take notes and only slightly less mysteriously jude law as warrior instructor our hero larson an alien supersoldier eventually falls through the roof of blockbuster video into very james cameron like 1995 they even get the mote filled los angeles haze just right where h e d agent nick fury digitally de aged samuel jackson astounding in every shot pulls up in his boxy car reporting for quip duty but if you don have furlong or sense of humour don play in cameron t2 fish out of water scenario scenes between fury and larson carol danvers who is learning her human origins are curiously passive and the film much touted feminism promised in months of build up advertising and interviews the movie calls out important message what does it imply that ben mendelsohn who is always appealing as villain here as bald pointy eared skrull ends up playing the most likeable character providing action heroics sarcastic quips and even paternal devotion shouldn larson have been there yes one of those gleaming power cubes is important to the plot you already knew that this movie also introduce the origin of avengers name by nick fury on the jet by carol simple but quite useful ', ' m pretty sure had grin on my face the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes including the 20 minutes waited after the film to check that there wasn a sneak peek after the credits it got great great story which is relatively true to the comics stan lee must have had lot of creative input into it really makes difference shows why his comics have been around for almost 80 years considering how many big characters there are the character development is fantastic you really buy in to each of their personal agendas and feelings the guy who plays the hulk is just incredible never seen him before don think he gives you the impression that he is loaded gun that can crack at any point fly of the handle and turn into this massive green smashing machine which obviously he does the tension is incredible it got laugh out loud moments liberally scattered throughout that was making the whole cinema laugh most of them coming from either robert downy jr or weirdly enough the hulk have to say felt really comic book geeky as there was one line that only comic geeks would have got laughed and about 4 other people behind me laughed ironicially enough we were also the people that stayed until after the credits the last act has some of the best action sequences that have ever been put on film period the cgi which there is lot of didn feel like cgi you are so engrossed and it is done so well that you forget that it actually is cgi it certainly helps to have grounding in the marvel films that preceded it but it definitely not necessary have seen them all so can be completely certain but think you do ok even if you haven there are some quick flashbacks and some expository dialogue about what happened in the other films enough to bring you up to good enough level to get it think obviously it better if you ve seen them though so if you haven yet highly recommend filling in the gaps would say that in descending order of usefulness you should see thor captain america the first avenger iron man 2 iron man and the incredible hulk adding to that my girlfriend hasn seen any of them thought she would just think it was geeky film but she loved it was shocked so much so that we ll be watching iron man 1 and 2 at her suggestion read loads of reviews saying that it is not worth watching in 3 i have to say completely disagree there is lot more they could have done with the 3 element for example hawkeye with his arrows would be amazing you know firing arrows at your face etc but prefer the subtle bits of 3 when you do not even realise when it doesn distract you from the film there are bits at the end of the last act where there are bits of ash just floating about in 3 very subtle very good there is bit after the initial credits so stay for bit not lot of people will get the character they show as it is not familiar villain but it does set up for sequel which will struggle to top this movie it is very rare that movie lives up to the hype especially for me but this will be the movie of the year spiderman batman will struggle to replicate the success if they can they will be amazing too it the best superhero film ever made that not hyperbole oh also scarlett johanson is in it and she is my favourite ', ' disappointed and no strong story trying to club the all super hero powers and made something which is not upto the mark ', ' was very hyped for this movie too like everyone else it was cool that they explained the backstory of natasha but other than that it was super mehh ', ' don know why this has so bad reviews on google and imdb but genuinely enjoyed the show it really good especially the first half iman vellani is perfect for the role of kamala khan it like she was made for it bruno is also great but in the friendzone sadly t also liked kamala father yusuf performance he so fun the nondiegetic visual elements look amazing and hope this wasn the last marvel project we see such effects in it a fun little ride miss marvel is the only reason m exited for the marvels movie the antagonists lack bit but great show nevertheless would highly recommend it ', ' really don understand all the hate the movie has good rhythm good acting direction is fine it a catchy song it not that bad go watch and you will have wonderful time ', ' apparantly nathasha romanoff have the same skeleton as wolverine since she survives about 6 7 times stuff that would kill or put you in wheelchair actually havent laughed so hard for years seeing that car flopping dozen times and don get why the movie exists get it florence pugh is taking over the mantle as widow jr with terrible russian accent other than that the plot serves as really bad bond movie with unintentionally funny scenes and that guy from stranger things as captain russia or something but in an even worse costume than cap america it the very talented scarlett johansson from much better movies like under the skin and marriage story swansong from marvel which also ended sourly with scarlett suing disney which sums up black widow as completely unecessary movie just fleshing out the widow storyline more boring than falcon snow soldier and don really care about marvel or multiverses anymore ', ' this could have been great and actually fell asleep because of how boring it was at times ', ' iiiiiiiiisssssssssss gggggggggooooooooooodddddddddddd is time to go back ', ' two daughters seperated from their parents finally reconcile and share moments together sadly this is the plot of black widow and it is as dull borrowed as it sounds couple of good action scenes but apart from that it is the same old saving the world from terrorizing psychopath hack not the farewell scar deserved ', ' so went in hopeful and confident that d like the film they ve tied up some of the story from avengers guardians of the galaxy and added origin story to captain marvel funny action packed with epic cgi ', ' didn make it 15 minutes before shutting it off so guess can really review the whole thing wasn going to waste my time it ponderously stupid and have high threshold of pain when it comes to superhero movies watched ms marvel and enjoyed it but it ends there didn waste my energy on secret invasion so maybe there is connection to the marvels that would have helped make sense of this trash heap but shouldn have to do homework to follow movie assuming there is actually some connection went in not really caring about any of these characters and walked right back out after like 10 minutes as it quickly became clear as to why the mcu needs to hang it up at thus point ', ' the advent of agents of h e d marks groundbreaking marvel event which attempts to create another branch of the connective universe this time in weekly television format since the marvel cinematic universe mcu has grown into global phenomenon the recently concluded series on channel 4 warrants meticulous diagnosis the following is an attempt to dissect the strengths and weaknesses of shield for the uninitiated the acronym means strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division brainchild of avengers scribe joss whedon there is no blueprint or preconceived notion for such show resurrected agent phil coulson clark gregg leads completely new team in world which has witnessed an alien invasion and where superheroes are the worst kept secret the series offered an opportunity to examine the lives of the ordinary players as opposed to the gifted ones an intriguing pilot showed promise for an interesting season ahead premieres in uk and across the pond on disney resident channel abc garnered the biggest network drama debuts respectively however marred by inconsistencies and decline in quality of narrative with one decent episode followed by lackluster one excitement for shield quickly dissipated one of the primary limitations of the show was its inaccessibility to marvel mainstays such as iron man and hulk which may have proved hindrance perhaps viewers clamoring for glimpse of the aforementioned characters misconstrued the meaning of the show since the premise was always to delineate the adventures of the agents and the influence of superheroes not the other way round also it is likely that the writers were expected to tread with heed to avoid affecting the continuity adversely this led to plenty of lip service and gratuitous name dropping from the avengers franchise while the link to the mcu was always the usp of the show the writers exploited this connection ad nauseam long before the series was able to forge its own identity serving as bridge from cinema to television screens clark gregg was quite often the saving grace of the main cast what began as scene stealing cameo in iron man was now full fledged role as the face of shield gregg was consistently able to inject proceedings with his charm and wit the initial story arc of coulson uncanny recovery following his demise in the avengers also provided gregg to flex his acting muscles the rest of the principle cast was less fortunate in this regard certain characters and even actors were clich and suffered from lack of development despite adequate time devoted to establishing said characters only wildcard computer hacker skye chloe bennet was the best of bad bunch apart from agent coulson audiences may have struggled to rally behind the remaining characters forte of shield was the potency of its guest appearances the reprisal of various roles from the mcu such as director nick fury samuel jackson agent maria hill cobie smulders sif jamie alexander as well as priceless new additions such as agent garrett bill paxton helped considerably you know the main cast is woeful when rave about the stellar guest appearances and cameos the principle cast often lacked the refined qualities of the aforementioned actors moreover the transition from movies to television provided scope of portraying an exciting connectivity to marvel franchises including specific episodes attributed to plot threads from iron man 3 thor the dark world and captain america the winter soldier all of which were coincidentally released around the inception of shield ultimately shield salvation lay in the arrival of captain america the winter soldier which heralded new dawn for the flat lining series those who have seen the excellent sequel will know that the collision of age old enemies hydra and h e d which resulted in wholesale decimation was central to the plot the cataclysmic events of captain america 2 coincided with shield and paid off extraordinarily well the conspiracy angle highlight of the second installment was at the forefront of vastly improved third part of the season since the fate of the titular organization rested firmly on said intrinsic twist it is likely the writers may have held back to properly exploit this unique opportunity the twist elevated the show generally with the actors now able to exercise their range while the writers were finally able to provide intriguing plot twists furthermore tie ins to iron man 3 and thor 2 were predominantly fruitful additionally the writers also paid homage to marvel comics by including characters such as deathlok graviton and blizzard while the mcu has gained universal acclaim for its game changing concept reactions to shield have been mixed the first half of the season in particular left much to be desired from both cast and crew the renewal for second season offers the chance to rectify shortcomings of the primary season the third half of the season had rejuvenated the show considerably here hoping season 2 follows suit ', ' the acting the action the costumes the plot this movie is total masterpiece honestly wish it was longer but still it was so good black widow deserves second movie ', ' it may be targeted at younger audience but it is so slow and without any entertainment value that kept asking myself why am watching this can imagine how anyone rates this above 5 stars which is being kind the lead actress is all well and good considering but the show itself is dull just because show is woke doesn make it good it has old school disney channel coming of age sitcom vibes but it going to be no from me dog there just not enough spark behind the plot or mediocre acting to make the well intended inclusivity shine maybe if was pre teen or someone who ate up everything disney released mindlessly without question ', ' to bad for daredevil to have so much unlogical and low quality frame time it looks like the had to fill all the 45 min of an episode so they made all the dialogs long and uneeded also poor actor selection the main characters are ok but electra for example is misfit would rather watch 30 min show that you don have to stretch every scene it so boring just started season 2 and can watch it anymore most of season 1 immediately past alot of scenes and didn even watch most of the dialogs and it didn change anything about the serves ', ' well this movie could have been good opportunity for having diverse marvel superhero hero movie with having the most youngest heroes both male and female but no but instead we get team of heroes were there are just mainly female and two males also why the hell is squirrel girl fat the animation as usual is the same as the one from marvels spider man and avengers assembles current season guess the action was good but too short also the music is tolaratable the voice acting was good but seriously bang zoom you dub some many animes but you waste great voice talent like dee bradley baker on this would have wanted to hear him on kakaeguri hunter hunter or even the new laws of the universe if those dubs were union but instead you wasted him on cheap movie pandering to kids so now it looks like have to give up this dream of him being in one well this movie wasn a complete time waste as it was my birthday yesterday and was just waiting for my dad to finish his phone interview and it worked as time killer ', ' adore marvel rising it such an interesting part of marvel ', ' this film is amazing theres ppl who gave low ratings but if you watched previous marvel films its really easy to follow and its realllyy funny didnt give it 10 but cant tell you why its spoiler but this film is amazing ', ' resisted like 10 minutes great special effects but they take it too seriously you can make good movie with superheroes if you make it this serious deadpool is the only superhero movie that is actually fun really bad ', ' think marvel can do better than this because we talk about black widow ', ' have no reference for the comic book character but the series is amazing love the integration of culture and family would definitely recommend if you are tired of the typical characters from mcu ', ' my titles says it all sat there watching this movie for free and honestly felt it to be waste of time when you have seen the character in the present and then make movie about their past then you had best come up with something other than providing an explanation as to how they came into possession of piece of clothing florence pugh did steal the movie from scarlett but for the most part sat there bored knowing that natasha would not die yelena would survive taskmaster one of the best marvel villains ever would be ruined and that wokeness would make bad movie even worse the family dinner scene which some thought was cringe actually thought was the best part of the movie marvel phase 4 gets hard pass from me beginning with black widow which should have come before avengers infinity war ', ' as with the other reviews the film could have use da lot of work over the top action scenes that did not add to the movie but instead dragged it on to achieve that 2 hour mark the writing was bland and the acting is paycheck few funny scenes but not enough to save the film not worth wasting your money nor time over it add nothing to the universe and introduces replacement for black widow m glad however that scarlet is free she can use her potential elsewhere ', ' so unfortunately disney did it again and bombed another super hero character it seems that everything that marvel puts out under the guidance of disney is destined to fail it as if disney purposely wants to alienate everyone with actual money the show had potential but unfortunately it looks like it was directed by teenager with little to no experience if disney keeps putting out material like this than can see canceling the service hawkeye had some potential but it was to pc that it sucked and sadly msmarvel and hawkeye had great cast unfortunately they were not utilized correctly and weak story lines ruined the mini series ', ' the show is ok so far entertaining and for certain audience iman vellani is very good she has great demeanor and so far at least is incredibly likable she is teenage girl with overbearing parents the show has potential let see if the writing holds up ', ' bad take on an incredible comic book series really cookie cutter offensive use of pakistani heritage to move the story forward lame and cheesy dialogue and most of the characters were worse versions of their comic book counterparts there are some well shot scenes and an attempt to add some cool artistic touches that are reminiscent like doodles in lisa frank trapper keeper the editing is pretty good but still isn edgar wright good editing don think new jersey and the bodega life are shown off well and worst of all with the changes made to her powerset they simplified her relationship to her heritage and religion when the comic showed much more realistic representation where kamala isn just mindlessly in love with being muslim without wearing hijab it comes off as tokenism ', ' just finished episode 5 this is such fun show the writing is done well the story is very family oriented fun adventures perhaps people who are down voting this don like teen drama which this is ', ' ms marvel played by iman vellani is fun show based in the mcu about powerful hero that targeted at mostly teens am not teen so feel like should stress that the problem with ms marvel is really the middle of the show it has isolated moments that are really good think the action in this can be almost blockbuster passing yet there are so many times the show can drag and focus too much on the world around ms marvel episodes 2 4 and 5 do this and the problem with character like this is that she is sidekick and will be just that in the the marvels movie with bri larson some other things did really like was the actress iman she played kamala really well and matt lintz who played bruno well this duo was likable and entertaining when it came to the main plot the side plots around these two are what makes it all really weak imagine teens will likely like this lot more and m excited for the marvels and the future of the mcu since we did get big reveal at the end of the show and an end credit setting up the marvels overall touching show at times with some fun moments and good action sequences mixed with some tropes teen drama very forgettable villain for future side kick superhero this is show support despite the rating and one would recommend to younger people but it was average at best to me personally ', ' 7 minus to be precise offcourse had build up expectations who didn after waiting another year for new marvel release and the fact it about the life of female superhero made it even more important the story behind black widow thought it could have had more contains the four leading characters that formed the made up family in the movie individually amazing actors except in this movie they didn lived up to their full potential there are some funny dynamics between them during the movie but wanted to see more like said it could be that was expecting more than should have florence pugh what an actrice with some extra lessons in dialect she played her part as the sister more than well and m not surprised marvel studios has more plans to work with her over all it a great movie if you love marvel comics anyway and please don let the reviews from other people ruining yours and if you wanna read them than do that after you see the movie yourself ', ' love marvel movies black widow is one of my favorite super heroes enjoyed the fight scenes the funny moments were great the action was there 8 10 must see if you are die hard marvel fan ', ' see desi people will love this so will west cause they ll get to see something different then usually marvel superheroes must watch series is all can say ', ' out of the 4 netflix series daredevil luke cage and iron fist weren bad but jessica jones was boring and crappy and is the absolute worst comic book series ever produced jessica jones was so boring and crappy that almost stopped watching halfway through the pilot episode but thought it would only be fair to give jessica jones chance by watching the entire pilot to see if it got better in the 2nd half of the pilot but it didn get better at all so stopped watching after the pilot episode because watching paint dry would ve been more interesting than watching jessica jones ', ' show about the boring shows m so tired of comic book crap they found way to make something even more pointless than all the movies and shows they were already making sheeples and shills enjoy ', ' it a shame it really is already felt it once had seen the first episode that this show lacks confidence in itself they tried to tell too much in that episode tried to establish too many characters and in doing so delivered the most predictable kind of story you could ever imagine we are talking 80 b movie type of storytelling here with the most stereotypical characters you ve ever seen they had so many great opportunities to make this right by letting us get to know castle little better first before throwing it all into the blender and hope for the best don care who lives or dies if don know any of the characters why would so unexpected that marvel which time and time again have proved to deliver good stories for their characters did this they should have had more confidence and let the show start off slowly and let the character build and let the other villains develop let us know what makes them tick make them interesting do something creative for sake instead we got this bag of mixed opportunities the reason believe they want all in so fast is because they are not sure about their audience so they throw in as much as they can and let the story and narrative suffer because of it well this is michael bay logic and it does not work it works on 12 year old too bad they are not allowed to watch this series huh it like this show spells hey people who like violence and blood aren all that smart so don bother making good story but we have come to expect lot from tv series in this century with many great shows as the medium provides the perfect platform for complex storytelling which is very hard to achieve in the cinema where you usually only have 2 3 hours to accomplish the same thing therefor wasting your talent when you have all these things to your advantage is cardinal sin and what hurts me the most is that jon bernthal is perfect as the punisher he just has the right grit and inner fire this character needs and just want him to explode in anger at any moment but when you can see exactly when that going to happen 20 30 minutes before it does well then the fun is over then the scenes has no impact already played them in my head 10 times over when we come down to it and the biggest surprise is that the scenes depicted in this series is far from as brutal as imagined for the most part not like the violence we saw in daredevil and that is something found puzzling thought it would be the other way around it not until the last 3 episodes where we really get the most violent scenes and those are truly awesome but why wait why wait to unleash the punisher until the very end so we have surprisingly gentle show here with some dull dialogues stereotype characters and not much depth the only true great thing about the show is jon bernthal and his believable performance but sadly he just has no time to develop or properly show his inner fire instead we get those family flashback scenes over and over and over and over and over and over again until it becomes parody in on itself why would they do this yes get it his family was murdered yes get it this is what fuels his fire but seriously don overdo it please don underestimate your audience the first 3 episodes aren all that good but the season becomes better as it plays along and the last 3 episodes is where the real stuff happens but all in all it a good watch just wished it was more surprising and brutal let hope season 2 gives us more of that btw you guys remember that scene from daredevil where the punisher is on the stand in court where he says m the punisher and m gonna kill em all yeah that was great scene there we saw him the real punisher but that was in daredevil here in his own show we rarely see him like this and that is just really weird give this show 6 out of 10 ', ' expected way too much for this movie and got it thrown right in my face proving me wrong won hesitate to watch it again ', ' great one shot it gives us good tease of what to come really like how they show peggy and how gritty she can be and how she is under estimated as always hayley atwell does great job with the role of peggy carter and she could have easily held full length solo film about her character the one shot is fun and yet tells an interesting story in fifteen minutes well put together unfortunately this one shot doesn quite fit into the peggy carter series wish they would have kept the more serious tone that they created here instead they put much lighter spin on it and the way the one shot ends doesn flow with the series ', ' theres no real way to say how good it is you just have to watch it to see for yourself ', ' wanted to like this show had really high hopes for this show after watching the first season of daredevil jessica jones is nothing but bad cheesy soap opera will say this before this show had no idea who jessica jones was had to look her up and do some research on her we are getting to the point where they are green lighting every superhero to either have their own film or television show when you start digging deep for new heroes to bring to the screen that is when you start to get into trouble this show dragged it played out like bad soap opera jones would get depressed about her current situation mix it with her past and drink then sleep with someone and then drink again the entire first season you waited for something to happen but it never did don think kristen ritter is bad actress she just had nothing really to work with here the stories were flat and dull jessica jones would have been better served in defenders television show where she was not the constant main focus where others would step forward and help carry her david tennant who played the villain kilgrave or the purple man was the only breath of fresh air in this series wanted more focus on him but the show was called jessica jones not kilgrave skip this and watch daredevil instead where all the characters are exciting and stories are intriguing jessica jones is 5 out of 10 at best watch only if you are bored or need cure for insomnia ', ' 5 rating for me is something might or might not watch again edit this has been lowered to 4 details below the concept of the show is clearly something that many would desire particularly due to the popularity of the avengers et al the subject matter for episodes with espionage etc could be lot of fun however special effects and gun battles can be the only thing to make show last the acting in this show is considerably sub par that might have to do with the writing and or directing the dialog is extremely corny or targeted toward simple minds it seriously detracts from interest in watching the show it makes me not want to sit for another episode to continue being slashed at with doggedly poor lines and cheesy choreography the character development was also slung together with little thought rushing it to get to the good stuff several of the characters are over clich particularly the nerd twins and the cia like operative ll still watch few more episodes with the hopes that they ll dial in some better quality dialog and reduce the cheese factor if not then think they ll whittle away much of their core audience those who like the craftier and wittier interactions of the films driving people to this show edit results below everyone is different so definitely would not say to avoid this show but if you like writing that keeps you on your toes yet ties into reality bit you might agree with my assessment edit 2013 12 02 have now watched through episode 9 this show did not improve the cheesy dialog has remained and actually worsened they even feel the need to explain their jokes simple ones it likely bad joke if the punchline needs to get jammed down your throat it not so funny when the moment is ruined with phrases like see what did there get it etc ', ' series is childish comedy puches are predictable overall couldn watch full episode religious references make it suspicious that marvel tried to get attention of particular audiences apart from few comic timings it offers nothing lost my interest at the very beginning when captain marvel is described as the greatest avenger of marvel ', ' too bad that black widow is released after loki series because after watch loki my expectation about marvel studio movies is so dam high and also black widow is giving us bad cgi even think avengers 2012 had better cgi than black widow especially in sky action and the last is when watch the trailer was expecting marvel will show us about her past her training her teenage life in redroom but instead they only giving us only the story by conversation and it disappoint me ', ' mean if marvel wants to make black widow movie then they should have focused on black widow but instead of doing that they made this movie for yelena red guardian and taskmaster for future mcu installments this movie had plain and very predictable plot and had some unnecessary humor it was so annoying when that lady from falcon and the winter soldier deliberately sneezed to mock yelena while mourning for natasha it was just pathetic most of the action scenes were forgettable and bland they ruined the taskmaster completely by showing her like terminator generally mcu movies have good third acts but in this case it was complete mess ', ' living in world of more than 7 billion people one must consider this as critical fact without trying to counter argue for any reason whatsoever the diversity in opinions can be unimaginably huge and what is the reason for this what are the main variables that are to be held responsible for someone opinions well there is the environment we grow up live in for two big ones with all their subcategories like the people that surround us and their beliefs of any kind if you grow up for example in family that values honesty they ll probably push you into becoming an honest being if you grow up in family that enjoys watching comedies in their free time you ll probably grow thing for comedies later on in your life no matter how attracted you may become to other genres of movies comedy will always be something you enjoy for various reasons the remembrance of your happy family moments for one let say you re fan of sci fi movies you most likely grew up watching such and you ve definitely been taken your breath away by certain classics as we call them nowadays that left you with some kind of mental mark about how awesome they were alien for instance totally breath taking horror film masterpiece for it kind it era so to my point it is wrong to compare any new film to the one that let you breathless mean feel free to judge that what you just watched is better or worse but you can direct whole review to why movie rocked your world or totaly sucked based on your mental mark about your favorite movie and it perfect to you characteristics specifications moments of course there are reasons and places to do so if for example there is an award to be given between two or more but nothing more or less did enjoy the avengers did enjoy the cast believe that robert downey jr acts in very stylish awesome for me way that might have enjoyed the movie only because like him as iron man mark ruffalo and christ hemsworth are very amusing to watch as well their impersonations of the hulk and thor being incredibly amazing overally the cast fit their roles well enough to create an enjoyable rocking atmosphere that will hold you tight in place until the very end there were plenty of moments where was slightly disappointed like the extreme damage and conditions that iron man suit could sustain the movie could have been better at certain points like these but the overall experience compensated hey it based on hardcore comic books after all and director joss whedon great attention to it making is clearly noticeable if you ve read the comics the movie was worth my time and give it seven out of ten ve seen couple of better action sci fi movies matter of personal preference and there always must be place for even better ones since human capabilities can be imagined thus seven from me to the avengers makes this action sci fi must see to those that agree with me an outstanding production ', ' it seems that hollywood can no longer make film without portraying all men as losers idiots cowards bullies etc etc only women are pure and good and noble and well you know this one is certainly no exception ', ' don know who to blame disney or marvel but this movie has nothing to do with anything so plain not much action not much adventurous vfx not upto mark everything is not what marvel was previously famous for is ruined ', ' even writing review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here am they even themselves admitted it the film is huge disappointment the plot is all over the place actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb didn know where to look where to pay attention like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic yes they tried but they utterly failed feige pulled off wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring trick again and it wasn a wow for me at least the theatre was silent throughout and after the film no one even made giggling sound dead silence jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time character made one that right every character there is comic relief and absolutely don wanna talk about acting ', ' its simply boring this just take 2 hours of my life away im waiting the secuel to give them bad review dont look this is bad longer and they dont paid good the actors ', ' this film is steaming pile of turd ve never disliked joss whedon love buffy and firefly serenity but he not very good director the actors seem to suffer as much confusion as their characters do almost like as torn as they are to join shield and the avengers in the film is how torn the actors must feel from scene to scene as to why they re even in this film captain america does not seem like 1930 man ve seen better period acting in mad men and the like was looking for some authenticity in him thor is paying so much attention to his hair he seems to have forgotten his point and scarlett johansson is horrific she so monotonously apathetic it shines through in her character and the only part of her face that shows any sign of acting is her eyebrow when it raises at one point the left one it was and this film is the longest bad film ve ever had the stupidity to watch another point that peeved me is that the action is so ridiculously loud but the speaking so quiet in comparison it was like every explosion was happening inside my head and every conversation was in the next room over and was listening in the avengers gets 1 point for the team dynamic when they re altogether it interesting to watch and 2 points for robert downey jr he a whole lot of man but even his humour and acting is outweighed by the stink of the rest of the film so it gets 3 out of 10 from me and black mark against mark ruffalo who was credible actor in my eyes ', ' cinematography was great the cast was good the direction was good the the story was even good the screenplay could have used lot of work though it exposition action exposition action and keeps on going until it ends some pretty good scenes good characters just makes one of the biggest film making mistakes in the book it tells the story it doesn show the story ', ' that was one of the worst s comic book movies ever it as bad as the first hulk movie and the green lantern movie with ryan reynolds some of the scenes in the avengers from the beginning to end were complete non sense very unnecessary felt forced lack creativity and almost amateurish don understand the high ratings and the high gross for the movie which is attributed to the 50 00 3d fees per person are some of you people on some kind of drugs maybe inhaling too much theater popcorn chemicals or something brain washed by joss whedon loved his movies and tv shows but 1hr and 40mins before we see any real actions and you guys think it a good movie come on it the same crap as the first hulk movie by the way ruffalo sucks as banner ed norton was great on the second hulk movie stop sniffing the popcorn chemicals please ', ' opening credits almost caused an epileptic fit with all the different frames this led in to the first 5 minutes that made it seem like the movie had potential but that when everything takes turn americans trying to do the russian accent is always recipe for disaster three of the main characters try to do it and it fails miserably the accents are that bad that it distracted me from the movie itself guess should be thankful the accents distracted me from the movie it was not redeemable more editing required to prevent watchers dosing off should ve watched movie had seen before instead of this do avoid ', ' guess being brown girl in us myself makes this highly relatable to me and frankly the lead and almost all the other characters are just so perfectly cast and the cinematography and the music is just wow ingenious way of showing the vibrant imagination of kamala who is played so adorably by iman can understand some of the other reviewers who were sad about the below standard cgi effects which is true and the messy storyline which is also true however didn go into the series looking for another awesome effects marvel movie we have enough of those already neither did expect storyline that makes sense most superhero stories are nonsensical if you really try to find scientific logic in them it a disney tv show and it aimed at young adults so of course it not too dark and the storyline is messy like most tv shows based on teenagers but the story of kamala khan understanding her past and present and finding her own place in this world through her new found superpowers and accepting herself as ms marvel was thoroughly enjoyable to me also as an indian would say however much they showed about the india pakistan partition wasn wrong anything more would have made it an rated show so of course they couldn go into the dark details but they still did great job and did mention yet how cute her whole family is made me miss my mom dad and brother and teen years which were weirdly similar even though so different it not show for everyone but come on 1 or 2 is ridiculous when the boring and over saturated falcon and winter soldier has 7 2 on imdb ', ' this is the worst mcu show ever maybe the worst on disney what is this show the acting cringe dancing cringe that action cringe even that part of carol is cringe worst than captain marvel and that movie sucks ', ' haven given very many films nine captain america being the biggest let down on superhero movies coming out now days was cautious to see this movie because it was huge budget with lots of famous cast as captain america was but had to see it as did others was surprised of the cast given all they can in this made this one of the best have seen in 2012 but still could not give 10 stars as did with thor loved all the actors and actresses in this movie but felt as paltrow should have given bigger role as she only given short scenes in this movie love the hiddleston he is destined for more great movies maybe playing mephisto and sepritoth in final fantasy movie great actor most of all downey jr stood out because of hes great acting skills he become guarantee bet on movies now days household name lol reason could not give 10 stars this film lost that 1 star in the cutting room film jumped in places some characters did not get screen time they should have such is hulk captain america nick furry and as mentioned before paltrow other then that visually spectacular action movie should be seen on big screen 3d if it wont kill your eyes ', ' if you are planning on watching this movie or similar one then it best you don check imdb out lot of reviews in here have been written by bots that gave the movie 10 without addressing any of its major issues that not to say don understand why anyone would like this movie it has some qualities such as action animation and few laughable lines but to viewer that want to be entertained by more than just cheesiness this movie fails first of all it commits mistake that is pretty obvious to begin with way too many major characters are tried to fit into one movie we are left with some story lines for hulk iron man and thor the most major members of the avengers while black widow and that bowman are just forgotten the villain is also pretty forgettable it loki that back and he a spoiled kid that never really seem that powerful or impressive compared to the avengers am not going to spoil anything but it seems like he attempts to be really clever villain but just ends up as spoiled kid the plot in general is also pretty forgettable it standard mediocre superheroes stuff that you ve seen hundred times in superhero movies if you re die hard superhero or marvel fan or just enjoy action and cheesy lines then this is your movie if you want movie with an interesting plot and characters then look elsewhere ', ' the first lego super hero animation saw was terrific it was witty funny had great script and was very well done this one not so much it not witty not charming just very mediocre the upside was the relationship between black widow and her father which is decent enough morality story for kids but it a long story for one point everyone is imperfect and everyone changes thanks for that sparkling wisdom but it doesn equate to the foundation for an entire film kids might like it but m thinking even they would only watch it once so not funny not witty not lego three bricks short of finished project ', ' really interesting and underrated show with perfect blend of humor and acton the last episode was little disappointing but was still good m going to be pretty disappointed if it doesn get season two highly recommend ', ' marvel has finally stepped into new and unknown territory by finally putting out show that features proper anti hero thankfully it mostly works out pretty well ', ' this movie started off the big budget franchise we loved for 7 years by now ok let me get into why liked this film starting with story the story is interesting as it kept my attention from beginning to end and it was so exciting for us to have our heroes come together to fight against loki but the avengers doesn have much of story as it doesn have layers to its story and its very simplistic compared to the complexity of the other avengers films they told cohesive and understandable storyline in this first avengers film second let get into the characters of this film the characters have really great banter between them as you have really good chemistry between each member of the avengers the main characters have backstory established in the previous mcu solo films that built up to the avengers and the characters are elaborately written cap as an example is brave soldier as established in the first avenger and his character see in tony man who wouldn sacrifice himself or any kind of character inside the suit tony see a man who got all his powers from bottle who isn worthy but they both prove each other wrong in specific mcu films such as tony who almost killed himself to stop the chitauri invasion on earth tony is great character who trying to do good and has guilt over his mistakes that he done but wish they had gone more into this backstory the only character didn like was loki the villain who you couldn understand and you didn know why he was invading earth he just big threat who wants to invade earth because he just wants to but all the heroes have arcs until they cooperate with each other third let explore the themes of this movie there deep themes of sacrifice teamwork and heroism the avengers mostly are working as team and from beginning to end they learn to cooperate with each other so they can defeat loki all the heroes are saving the world from loki an example of sacrifice is tony who almost sacrifices himself to save earth from the chitauri invasion fourth let explore the acting the cast is amazing robert downey jr is the best actor here as you cannot imagine anyone else in this role and chris evans shows the bravery of his character here scarlet johansson is attractive and she a fun female character who a interesting spy mark ruffalo has more charming humor than the other hulk actors and he always having fun in this role for me the cast was great as everyone did good job on their performances and roles next let me analyze the visuals the special effects here are stunning as they all look realistic and the visuals are overly authentic as there never look at really fake looking cgi or special effects the movie did well in this category therefore like the movie and rate it 8 10 ', ' received exactly what expected ll receive the first half is actually pretty enjoyable ride with an excellent prologue the prologue very effectively showcases the situation and the execution of the whole scene is very good the dialogues among the members of the family are nice and the new characters are just fine especially david harbour as the red guardian taskmaster is pretty boring villain and the reveal was ok overall pretty ok experience just the filler between the mcu movies just the preparation for the real deal ', ' really enjoyed the earlier ones but this was really dumbed down with very little effort they could have made this great movie you cannot defy laws of physics in special effects or it becomes completely 5 year old cartoon nonsense that is the problem here be logical with the scenes instead of being lazy the graphics capability is there so don cheapen it by taking short cuts it distracts from the entire movie that and great effects mixed in with the most primitive of video overdubbing in many scenes you can plainly see the backdrop with people standing in front of it you think you were watching 1940s film with overdubbing geeesh come on do it right or don do it at all ', ' avengers assemble has been smashing the box offices all around the world it is tipped to be one of the highest grossing films of all time the film has been strongly anticipated by marvel fans worldwide who stuck on through the credits of the original character films to see nick fury played by samuel jackson hint at the upcoming film the film itself has certainly lived up to the hype the cast is superb with an all star cast including robert downey jr chris evans scarlett johansson chris hemsworth samuel jackson and gwyneth paltrow it also includes new up and comers mark ruffalo jeremy renner and tom hiddleston in the very beginning it is quite dull but it gets progressively better and better as it goes along the cast all work together really well and there are tonnes of laughs and shining moments robert downey jr iron man tony stark is definitely one of the shining stars downey jr and johansson were the best of the bunch they both did some fantastic acting and were absolutely hilarious chris evans captain america steve rogers annoyed me because his character is very cocky and relatively boring yet he got quite lot of screen time the film has its up and it has its minor down but overall the film was fantastic and really enjoyed watching it m sure there will be sequel here hoping it as good as this ', ' first time watched this it felt very much 6 10 film recently rewatched it and this solid 8 9 10 action is fantastic and the introduction of black widows family is great florence pugh is amazing she is so funny emotional and her action scenes are great too 2nd time round the ray winston bad guy worked more so and he was very menacing david harbour as red guardian works well too the question is which captain america did he previously fight weird quad bill can be done with this film if you already seen end game start with civil war then black widow then infinity war and finally end game ', ' like 6 5 stars didn think it was as bad as many people said but got bit too silly at times for me most of the fun was getting to see pre director nick fury with 2 good eyes and agent colson who just joined shield as for captain marvel well remember nuclear man yes the bad guy in that train wreck superman 4 movie feel like they took that guy powers gave it an upgrade and made him woman it seems like she got her powers too easily and when she learned to use them it was almost like the justice league movie when superman came back to life to fight steppenwolf because he easily beat him down and it was like the rest of the team didn matter much this was bit like that ', ' fantastic series anyone who read the comic book will love this series season one was spectacular season 2 was even better with the notable exception of the season 2 finale the last episode of season 2 was serious let down otherwise every other episode was pretty spectacular ', ' would have been better if they stuck to the original and hadn changed both the story and kamala powers instead of modernised feminist teen superhero carly effort but pretty decent show for people who don judge ', ' great show last 15 minutes was an amazing wrap up ', ' ve really enjoyed the first season of ms marvel like that she is not the same as all other superheroes that she acknowledges that herself hadn read her comic books before watching the show but love the family aspect and the care to show her culture not unlike all other superheroes we get true sense of who she is where she comes from and what matters to her this first season made me laugh cry and learn m excited for the next season ', ' movie was ok yelena nice task master trash you can delete whole character from movie and nothing will change ', ' the avengers is your average superhero action movie the movie only succeeds at doing one thing mindless action the storyline was typical just bunch of superhero saving the world the special effects were typical of 2012 after about 20 minutes of watching it you ll get bored if you love mindless action with your favourite superhero then you should watch this movie however if your want movie which is interesting with an unique storyline then absolutely do not watch this movie an overall boring average superhero movie don people ever get bored of this typical mess know do ', ' you know when you watch something and someone grows on you vincent onofrio is great actor his turn as villain is fantastic his presence is felt even when he just shortly seen like in season 2 but the main character daredevil and his two sidekicks didn exactly feel them too much at the beginning there was certain blandness there maybe it wasn ben affleck then and it is the role that is weird to say the least the cast over the seasons is amazing to say the least having people like scott glenn appear and even have action scenes that would make liam neesons taken character jealous and or proud is quite something and speaking of action the choreography is amazing to say the least what didn quite work in iron fist season 1 is full on display here liked all the seasons of this but it does end on quite the high note which is sad overall because the character grew on me then again there are talks of marvel maybe reviving the show or at least the character for the mcu d reckon maybe on disney it would be interesting to see how the violence would be handled though netflix did not hold back disney on the other hand is more let say family orientated we ll see reckon great show with an amazing season 3 that ticks off all the right boxes ', ' after watching this movie one thing which came in to your mind is wooow great job in fun and action and their combination is deadly just watched is yesterday and buy ticked for today too show is on must say its movie which you would like to see again and again and again effects are awesome and every super hero play its vital role my personal favorite iron man was as usual wicked action of hulk was breath taking this time loki was looking good in suit over all concept was amazing which we have seen before many times gathering super heroes for common cause but the way they did this time was simply the best ever ', ' didn read the comic so just enjoyed the show all of the movie beginning from story cinematoghrapy and the character love it all but hope marvel can make it more incriedible like the fans said ', ' m not understanding the negativity here what did you expect how did it let you down iman vellani is great it only one episode in and there been so much negativity thought d jump on here to bring some balance loved the show and m eagerly awaiting the next episode it really is wholesome back to basics storytelling who knows maybe won like it once it finished but as it stands m all in wasn expecting to like it but did if you didn like it ok move along it clearly wasn meant for you stop with the racism aye thankfully it only from minority of the comments ', ' this is perhaps one of the best shows ever made and the best part is that it keeps getting better and better every season firstly you will be confused as to why am watching this at all but once you get hang of it you wont regret any second that you spent watching it am really gonna miss this series and would hope to have more seasons of it or have another such series ', ' bad story bad actors and not marvel at all had better expectation about show but it was total waste of time watched 7 episodes to see if it could get better but not at all ', ' as we already have been dosed with low script quality with thor love and thunder which single handed managed to sing the entire franchise down into quicksand hole that there is no escape from there could not be another low mark but almost the all female main cast is by no mean making this movie less worth the mcu heritage quite the opposite was hoping for some rejuvenation and some story that was not based upon only big muscles unlimited powers and junvenile comments from males in spandex suits sadly even here the mcu has lost lot of it good script writers which can be seen in the actors performances as they strugle to make sense of their very limited number of lines am pretty sure that even if the audience expected for this movie was girls between 12 17 they are not to be insulted with low quality scripts when portraying female role models mcu this is the last movie that let the love of the world that stan lee left us with influence my rating to the positive side if would have watche this in the cinema would have requested refund so that could have watched the latest dc movie instead ', ' it was funny charming and the cast all seemed to have great chemistry really enjoyed it laughs so many laughs samuel jackson and the khan family really brought the fun there 4 5 cringe worthy minutes in the middle that ll be skipping once can watch at home but those minutes aside really enjoyed it fyi way better than love thunder the world most awkward thrust in the eternals and even better than antman 3 will add though if marvel wants to do young avengers they better get wiggle on cause all these kids will be older than the stranger things kids will be when they graduate high school ', ' much like daredevil the real saga of jessica jones is that of the villain david tennant shines as dark and broken sociopath his performance is chilling and terrifying and asks dark questions about what we would do with ultimate power over those around us and about what would become of us stepping past tennant breathtaking performance the rest of the casting is apt and on point any fan of the comic books will be hard pressed to fault jessica jones or luke cage their chemistry and dynamic is ink made flesh and the characters that we loved brought to screen the supporting cast are equally brilliant especially the trio of australian actors supporting in the roles of trish walker will simpson and malcolm comic book buffs will quickly spot the nods to comic cannon and the fascinating divergence and rebirth of comic book icons there is extensive dialogue and set references to comic book icons that shows phenomenal attention to detail that becomes love letter to long term fans of these properties jessica jones breathes yet more life into the promise of the defenders franchise at netflix bring on luke cage iron fist and future seasons if for some reason you haven yet signed up for netflix this show alone is reason to do so ', ' the avenger is critical movie for the superhero genre in general and hasn aged poorly at all despite being released 10 years ago the movie may be simple but its simplicity became core to hold the foundation of superhero films from the action different character interactions and even little bit of light hearted comedy but since this was the first time the avengers were meeting simplicity was really what the movie needed the film emphasized the chemistry each character had in the movie more than you expected this was great plan so you can fully see the avengers as real team this movie is meant for the entire family to watch and the film has excellent replay value watching this back will always bring smile to your face on how far the mcu has gotten ', ' the marvels is surprisingly good time at the theater iman vellani steals the show and had us laughing and smiling through most of the movie teyonnah paris brings the monica you know from wandavision completely back finally giving us some answers as to what happened between her and carol and let talk about brie larson it no secret brie can act but she never really gotten much to do within the mcu this movie finally lets brie show her full range of emotions as we see her filled with sorrow to absolute joy despite how powerful these women are they came up with way to make the challenge actually feel like something they had to overcome this isn an easy victory for them there a great training montage during the film that sees them work on their skills but even after that they aren yet ready to win and if they actually win in this movie at all is debatable the villain is fairly forgettable like many marvel villains it felt like this was written to feature ronan originally but then they remembered he was dead or possibly they planned to use another kree we knew from the first movie however despite their forgetableness they truly were force to be reckoned with clear motivations they were prepared to accept their fate in the end because they believed in their cause so much there were some very great moments throughout and some side characters like kamala family and flerken or more really made some of the scenes all the more fun if you like your movies to give you smile this one is for you ', ' really tried to like this but found it pretty awful guess it really meant for young audience but nonetheless think it the worst mcu adaptation ', ' watching the first episode of ms marvel confirmed my impressions of the trailer when it was released really like iman vellani haven seen her in anything else but she very watchable with pretty and repressive face and good comedic timing but really disliked the character of kamala khan she has few redeeming qualities and just came off as childish and selfish there was nothing about her that made me want to stay tuned to see where she went next she seems downright shallow as for the production the look of the film while appreciate the effort to be different lot of the gimmicks became annoying to me and did nothing to really compliment the story can imagine ms marvel becoming better than it is now and it seems unnecessary unless one finds the marvels to be an important addition to the marvel universe which at this point don ms marvel seems to be an underwhelming character at present ', ' there have been some pretty amazing reviews for marvel daredevil so won say much when watched the second episode suddenly realised that this was going to be as gritty and dark as all the recent versions of batman including the incredible trilogy from christopher nolan and the music is equally as haunting two seasons in and m still huge fan if it ended today ll still be glad they made it although m hoping for at least 5 more seasons ', ' love just how fun and creative this show is the way the directors have made the world so colourful and innocent showing it through the eyes of kamala is so entertaining and how they are using cgi to enhance the story through all those small animations is so creatively refreshing ', ' while the previous marvel one shots focused on fast quick explorations of the universe item 47 takes its time and allows for more storytelling following agent jasper sitwell maximiliano hern ndez he is tasked with retrieving chitauri weapon from some bank robbers robbing banks on their journey down the east coast claire weiss bennie pollock act as modern bonnie clyde albeit less organized or professional while their antics are entertaining in slapstick manner the short focuses on comedy and fails to provide much outside of that the marvel one shots are wonderful idea but so far they have been heavily underutilized and fail to expand the universe in any meaningful way ', ' m big fan of marvel movies and ve watched them with great interest from the beginning ve been waiting for this movie to come out for long time and was very disappointed after watching it very boring and dry scenarios it good that the cast is up to par otherwise this rating is lot guess it was intended for an american children and at the same time female audience otherwise it is not worth it ', ' it an origin story that not as good as some of the others in the mcu but still good movie it gave you action inspiration some comedy and it was serious when it needed to be serious it was the perfect segway into end game think marvel should ve introduced the character movie sooner everyone is so hyped up for end game they have nothing but bad things to say the trailer doesn do it justice don listen to the negativity go see the movie also stay until the entire film credits end ', ' first of all jon bernthal was weasel in the walking dead second he redeemed himself here in the punisher third not since dolph lundgren has the punisher been captured in his true essence of calculated mayhem disney needs to give this character actor the big screen treatment or go straight too hulu too continue the mayhem ', ' honestly this movie was equal to what my expectations were think that black widow is rated lower than would think since people had massive expectations after waiting long time but if black widow came out when it was supposed to in may 2020 then it would be rated higher on imdb firstly it has very good action and is super action packed the story line is good but could have been better the characters are ok but some people such as the villain had no background story whatsoever the acting is really good especially the sister and dad who are super funny and amazing in the action sequences good comedy good effects and ok drama overall this is great movie that would recommend ', ' m not really comic book fan so after hearing the constant hype about this film for couple of years really wasn too fussed when it finally appeared on tv went into it expecting not to like it much and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best some mildly lame comedy whole lot of posturing and silly storyline involving silly characters then things changed they started to pick up and the action started hitting home then all hell broke loose with climax that felt like it lasted whole hour an hour packed with kaiju style mayhem as new york found itself subjected to an alien invasion and was wowed never before has it been possible to depict such constant wide scale mayhem but with the improvement of cgi technology it finally up there on screen with all of its glory and yes ended up liking marvel avengers assemble what not to like really the whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger than life characters that you end up having ball with it regardless mark ruffalo hulk is my favourite character by far ruffalo is far better suited to the role than eric bana or edward norton but chris evans captain america comes close second sure see this film for what it is mindless piece of crowd pleasing overblown cgi mayhem replete with silly buffoonish bad guy but at the same time can help but getting caught up for the ride ', ' watching the 3rd season has confirmed my feelings towards the show it is the greatest show of all time ', ' and didn even knew this character great refreshing surprise ', ' the avengers is undoubtedly the best superhero movie ever made brilliant script great actors and awesome effects all actors have performed their role very well but what caught my eye are robert downey jr iron man and mark ruffalo hulk chris evans is good and scarlett johansson is looking pretty jeremy renner hawkeye and chris hemsworth thor are average the action scenes mixed with 3d effects take your breath away the movie is full of entertainment and some scenes will give you goosebumps if you are fan of superhero movies then you must watch the avengers this movie worth every penny highly recommended ', ' what sucks is this could have turned out to be pretty good but the acting is pretty horrible the script is disney themed probably product of marvel for teenagers studio mean the superpower of extraterrestrial beings is karate who came up with that genius idea does he get paid for coming up with dumb ideas what with the rainbow puke superpower mean its literally green lantern power except it looks like rainbow puke somehow green lantern didn have that much tough time mastering it also misogyny is acceptable at least cut off that part mean you turned the most horrible incident in human history partition into joke so why not turn everything else into some sorta cotton candy story turning partition into some sorta disney story is like turning pearl harbor into cinderella story why don the writers try doing that and see how far they get with that the only good part was the music ', ' wonderful movie to watch if you want to be entertained and not think about the plot too much ', ' loved watching son of coul be revived in beginning it was not so great but the twist after turn turn turn increased an ending in season 7 was also very emotional ', ' this clich drivel extravaganza was more than painful to sit through also the explosions were too loud had to occasionally turn the volume up when cant hear them speaking and then booom my ears bleed cant quite put my finger on why the presentation looks retarded and circus like hell just look at captain america suit or the archer as he awkwardly cocks his crossbow open like dumbass the special effects delivered as expected but thats all there was no sensible plot they came up with nothing and crammed all the characters to prance around for pageant show the director of toy story in my opinion was misplaced he just didn fit the style at all waited for the blu ray release then disappointed ', ' they got her name race and major fangirl right but couldn get her origin or power even close why choose an existing character and then change everything no inhumans which exist in the mcu and not even terrigen mist connection or will that run out to be in the stupid bracelet or is this some nega band reference also think she goes bit too far with her parents she is supposed to be unique rebellious and break some rules but she ignores too much and breaks too many rules and when she coldly shot down her dad hulk without talk or anything think they have strayed too far and focused on the wrong things she doesn even stretch ', ' she just came over cartwheeling and flying through the air when she could have walked because she was right in front of me but it cracks me up everytime she does it she can walk she does unnecessary cartwheels all the time anyway sherlock holmes er mean black widow in white was boring and just lame attempt to fill disney next up from disney the story of the taxi driver who gave ride to iron man for 20 seconds ', ' after watching this movie there is only thing want to say please don waste your time and money watching this movie ', ' had great time enjoying this movie with my teens ', ' first episode pulls you in instantly and makes you want to know more only watched jessica jones tried to watch defenders but too boring of the netflix hero shows and it seems this comes close to it but have to mention even in the first episode netflix lays it on thick cracka this white christian that and all that good stuff hope they let off on it in future episode or this one is going in the bin with the defenders ', ' could say that the footage we all have seen from avengers doesn do it justice mean you could thought that m lying but hell no have to say that was truly skeptical about this film but was damn wrong joss whedon has pulled off one of the best superhero flicks ve ever seen it does not hit the dark knight but it the best marvel studios film so far anyway the avengers was epic good writing good performances good action scenes my god it really great action packed that unite cap iron man thor and hulk hulk really hit it off one of the greatest surprises of the film guess even haters will enjoy that is all ', ' from those who brought you the badass daredevil comes series not even half as daring as daredevil but still lot less boring than the iron fist ', ' great show but deborah ann woll can act she has no range and her character is dampening the show love the crossovers from other shows ', ' this movie probably gets low rating from all the mcu nerds ', ' the actors did great job so no objection there it felt like that marvel was trying to do an experiment which went terribly wrong for those who haven watched the tv shows they sat in the theatre clueless the teleportation sequence was headache instead of being exhilarating it was exhausting the actors who played kamala family are fine actors but they felt too indian rather than pakistani mind you they might look similar but there still big difference in two cultures secondly that cartoon sequence gave me the vibe of diary of wimpy kid and not fun to watch sorry the movie should ve started with brief but subtle recap of what happened in the tv shows then slowly picking up the pace all three ladies were great see iman has great timing for comedy and have good future ahead but it not standup comedy for her to flourish it will require great team work and bit of darker reboot different timeline maybe ', ' the marvels is film that has been building up since the beginning of phase 4 and after waiting over two years to see how this story unfolds can say with confidence that marvel definitely fumbled the bag with this one and has made one of the worst films in the mcu for the positives brie larson carol danvers captain marvel makes her long awaited return after traveling the galaxy alone since avengers endgame and have to say her character definitely feels more fleshed out here than in the original captain marvel film and was glad to see her return overall the standout star of the entire film though had to be iman vellani as kamala khan ms marvel she steals the show in every scene she is in and shines the brightest out of the main stars teyonah parrish also returns as monica rambeau and makes her long awaited superhero debut as photon while also having some of the best moments of the film as well the chemistry between the main three actresses work overall and was glad to see them finally come together on the big screen the visuals for the most part were breathtaking while also stunning as well for the negatives samuel jackson returns as nick fury after being last seen in secret invasion which was not fan of and after seeing him in this as much as like him as actor nick fury was definitely not needed for this film and he gives probably the worst performance of his entire career in this film it felt like the nick fury we got here compared to secret invasion are two entirely separate characters also the villian dar benn played by zawe ashton was probably one of the most poorly written and worst villains to ever come to the mcu when it comes to the plot choices and dialogue some of the choices made were obviously not the right ones and the dialogue was also some of the worst ve ever heard in film period overall the marvels succeeded with bringing our three main hero to the big screen in style while also setting up what to come in the future but with poorly written plot choices bad dialogue unnecessary characters and weak villain makes this film below average for mcu film rating 5 10 ', ' culmination of several movie franchises the avengers certainly delivers there could have been many ways that the studios could have screwed this movie up but they chose the right director joss whedon former helmer of buffy the vampire slayer and firefly on tv as well as an actual comic book writer for marvel comics whedon knows his stuff and he creates what is probably the most compatible comic book movie ever the whole film reads as if it was an actual marvel comic book whedon subtly melds the disparate elements from multiple other comic book movies and effortlessly creates an epic storyline that makes sense the tesseract known to comic fans as the cosmic cube that was the focal plot point of captain america the first avenger 2011 has been recovered and being studied closely by the government when loki tom hiddleston the villain of the previous thor 2011 movie appears and takes control of it in response col nick fury samuel jackson in his usual badass self decides to form small but lethal response team iron man captain america hulk black widow hawkeye and thor if they can get along and work together then they might have chance to save the world being the top billed character because of box office receipts iron man robert downey jr gets the best lines and almost steals the entire show his wisecracks upends the traditional leader of the avengers captain america chris evans playing the straight man to everyone else and puts the latter character in disadvantage the movie lone weakness is that cap doesn get to do much other than act as foil to the larger than life tony stark thor chris helmsworth does shine in the few scenes in which he is at front and center while both hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson give much needed humanity since they are the only members of the team that don have superpowers but the one character that makes the most impact of his limited screen time is mark ruffalo who plays the volatile hulk ruffalo plays bruce banner as smoldering stanley kowalski always seemingly in control yet has temper like nitroglycerine his banner is different from the brooding eric bana of 2003 hulk or the timid edward norton of the incredible hulk 2008 you don get to see much of ruffalo compared to the others but his character is the most intriguing of all hiddleston is adequate as the pouty scheming loki but you can help but believe that he is simply outgunned with all these powerhouses surrounding him the movie is almost perfect but does fail to take chances with their characters evan captain america is direct copy from the mainstream comic book but you wished he might have been given more of an edge like the ultimate marvel incarnation of captain america slightly racist do gooder who prefers to smash heads when someone doesn measure up to his 1930 morality if only the movie had been longer there might have been more insight into his character but with this film running over 2 hours it might have been systematic one in the end though there is something for everyone in this movie from the constant action scenes to the quiet ones that add humanity to what would otherwise be cardboard clich highly recommended ', ' fantastic spider man homecoming feel they captured some real magic here made me instantly love character that knew very little about loved the idea of the fan girl becoming hero herself ', ' have watched every marvel movie ever and am glad that they have been including more female characters have to say captain marvel is the perfect cherry on the delicious cake that marvel has created the movie is fun the story is interesting the soundtrack is exactly what every one who grew up on the 90s would connect with ', ' the amount of hype and praise this movie has gotten is out of hand it simply blockbuster action movie with superheroes the plot is easy to follow bad man wants to take over the earth for some reason gets help from aliens to do this superheroes stop him them of course this is bit general and yes know the names etc of all these people beings having had separate movies for many of these heroes thor iron man captain america the incredible hulk we know these superheroes their character and motives if you will not all the audience will have seen the previous movies but it not exactly difficult story to follow and we have seen the same plot 10000 times before in different variations and in different mediums books comic books films etc you guys could see the movie or read about the whole synopsis right here because can bother telling it in detail anyway point is this if you want to see summer blockbuster action movie with lots of eye candy then you have discovered the right movie it fun enjoyable and with lots of action naturally if you re looking for great story though you might have to look somewhere else there really no surprising twists or complexity no fear for the well being of any of the characters and in short not really interesting story to tell all the action scenes are fun etc but if an alien species invaded us would assume that they would have more potent weapons than some laser guns and huge fish like robots that crash into buildings in manhatten really demi god like loki and an advanced alien species are content with ravaging manhatten bit seems like we humans have better weapons alone in the atomic bomb because one of those was enough to stop them yeah and we have superheroes three of which are severely underpowered and don understand why they were even there black widow hawkeye and captain america lame enjoyable and fun to watch but bad story should get around 6 7 imdb rating simply because it a well made action movie blockbuster no way this is among the best movies ever made as it stands now in the imdb ratings ', ' m sorry but no this movie doesn even work as filler also it was me and 3 other guys in the theater friday mind you ', ' m loving this show it fun all over it the first marvel studios show that acknowledges the superfan in all of us visually it so rich and innovative great colors and music fun all around can help feeling like m watching scott pilgrim fusion with spider man home coming love it and my family loves the show too ', ' whole series was dead boring there was rarely any fight plenty of overacting nothing to see even the character power is inspired from green lantern depressingly nonsense ', ' my neice loves captain marvel and was excited and enjoyed ms marvel typically tv and film can hold her attention watching her enjoying the series and getting excited over the characters is enough for me to give the show billion stars if could hate the expectation these days that every show and film has to be bespoke for the viewer otherwise it the worst thing you ve seen you don have to like it but don ruin it for those that do the show itself is fun and really steps outside of the narrow view of what hero origin story should be ', ' along with thor ragnarok it is my favorite marvel movie so much better than the cookie cutter films we have had ', ' except for kilgrave the characters are so dumb it mind boggling jessica is the most bumbling doesn learn from experience or her mistakes kind of so called superhero ve ever watched what in the world are the writers thinking m amazed at all the gushing over some of the worst plotting mean seriously it has so much potential that the writers creator show runner somebody in charge doesn have clue how to handle jessica stumbles from one silly choice to another you can watch her coming up with another dumb idea not based on any kind of logic based on things that just happened and her best pal omg talk about wanting to slap character senseless until they get some sense but then that about all of them geez ', ' liked this film was not bored while watching it liked brie larson acting so don see any causes to hate this movie in my humble opinion it typical marvel origin typical but not bad it is funny exited and interesting origin samuel jackson is the icing on the cake so charismatic my rate is 9 10 ant think that is well deserved ', ' couple of chuckles from the one liners action scenes that went on too long and predictable and inevitable ending it was okay and easy watching to pass friday evening just don expect too much from it challenging and fine work of art it isn a bit of fun it is hiddleston made fine villain and the other characters performed as expected e not everyone is going to get an oscar for best actor no matter how many films they make some of the hook and line dialogue was spoken as if they were bored perhaps they were cgi is well cgi they worst aspect of this film though is the title if you were expecting steed and emma peel or purdey and gambit then you are going to be very disappointed ', ' am by no means part of this show target demographic nevertheless love seeing window into different culture and seeing how different but also how similar we all are the scene where kamala goes to the mosque festival reminded me of church festivals attended while growing up think the super hero aspect of the show is just bonus iman vellani lights up every scene she is in pun intended and look forward to seeing this actress in other roles she is relatable and just adorable will absolutely see the marvels next summer but more for iman vellani than for bree larsen because of her infectious enthusiasm ', ' she saved this film an average marvel flick but thankfully scarlet johansson made it worth watching 7 from me ', ' wasted my time on this after seeing the reviews here the plot is so immature hardly any thought process has gone into it plot holes are numerous hardly entertaining with highly predictable storyline ', ' don believe there exists perfect 10 10 movie but this one is the closest could find to it it delivers on the big and the little the spectacle and the quiet moments the epic action sequences and the character growth even now with the larger roster movies like infinity war and endgame the og avengers holds its ground as masterpiece among not only its genre but of all other movies it will be very very difficult for another movie to replace this as my favorite film of all time ', ' when heard that abc was going to do an hour long show about agents of shield had hope that this wouldn be your typical superheroes like smallville or arrow the marvel comics grew up with was renown for being comic of diversity but given abc track record for its lack of diversity when it comes to its shows wasn surprised that aos doesn have actors that look like me had high hopes on the pilot but was disappointed and every week the network promised the show would get better the show reminds me of once upon time superheroes version and the feeling that m watching one long marvel movie that should have ended hours ago the only reason this show exist is because disney has invested too much money to pull the plug and as much as admire joss whedon he alone can save what could have been the best superhero show ever instead its just vehicle to show trailers for the next marvel movies ', ' great action does an amazing job of bringing all these marvel characters together sets up bright future for the marvel universe ', ' expected to hate this based on the bashing it got so far but really enjoyed the film brie larson was great cgi of samuel jackson was great to looking forward to seeing her in endgame ', ' why do we see english dialogue when there are only pakistani talking together it absurd and it really ruins the feeling of the show so disappointed as it happens multiple times each episode ', ' to be honest the acting and direction is awful capt marvel usually looks left then right before flying the dialogue sounds like they are reading in one scene the villain is hiding on the running board of the car betty is driving then opens the door points gun at her telling her to move over and she does this so matter of factly as if she is expecting this she is not at all surprised there is someone there the flying and stunts are great tom tyler looks the part but short on dialogue the cave set looks bit phony billy batson smiles for no reason whitey is very good sidekick reed hadley voice is excellent as always and his acting is very professional john davidson is believable and liked his acting the henchmen hats stay on during the fight scenes just like cowboy westerns but the actual fights seemed to be staged well the story was very good it carried my interest in each chapter the cliffhangers were probably the best of all serials they really made you want to see the next one the music was absolutely wonderful can close my eyes and hear the sound of strings when captain marvel flies although report some negative aspects can understand that this is the best serial still love it and will buy some dvd for gifts know quiet few people who will love them ', ' this is by far the most chilling marvel series have watched there is such personal depth to these characters that marvel rarely delivers with substance we can help but sympathise with the villains but also hate their guts and we even find ourselves disagreeing with the morals of the protagonists this is by far marvel most complex show character and storyline wise and the way the storyline is executed by the actors and producers are next to perfect am huge marvel nerd and always find things to complain about but this is the one show can find anything to critique beautiful ', ' nope just no this is case study on how not to build superhero tried to like it watched the first 3 episodes but nope decided to end my disney plus subscription as well signed up because of mandalorian no longer going to pay for stuff like obi wan kenobi the upcoming star wars reva ugh ms marvel smh ', ' season 3 reminded me why liked this show in the first place great action scenes and great build up before them the atmosphere was really effective in conveying the tension and think that was season 3 biggest strength was surprised of how good the soundtrack was at times love that they took the time to introduce the backstories of characters and they did that effectively for the most part am picky about the shows watch so do wish some things were improved like dialogue sometimes seems repetitive some stories seem forced the way they are put into conversation and some key moments are stained by not up to par dialogue only because the rest of the show sets the bar really high like when foggy tried to be badass and convinces people it doesn work for me it part dialogue part mediocre acting there also the way that they handled agent pointdexter backstory the dinner scene was sloppy and the thing that detail like that disappoints me because it was so easy to get it right that it shows certain lack of passion in the craftsmanship of this show know know am being overly critical but that because like the show lot and if it were to improve on these accounts it would reach levels of dark knight quality and who doesn want that ', ' did not like captain marvel from the start so was already pessimistic when started watching the movie in the end was right because if this movie was not movie released by the mcu it would not have had an imdb rating of more than 7 but completely the opposite it would be laughing stock the movie is lazy and forced it is just not done right everything feels rushed and empty she acts way more arrogant and chill at the same time than she should be the script writting is awful the dialog is nothing special the villains are also very forgettable but in the end we all knew it was bad casting choice when we saw brie larson and the movie was doomed to be bad but not to fail cause it is an mcu movie ', ' very well done plenty of action with great story line those giving poor ratings forget that movies are fun and this had plenty of fun ', ' with over 40 projects in the marvel cinematic universe canon it can be bit of headache trying to keep up with all the characters this film does great job reminding the audience of the main three protagonists backstories without missing beat the chemistry between the three women is strong with captain marvel finally feeling human though the stakes are high the film is surprisingly grounded each character has their moment to shine even with the fate of the world hanging in the balance the film does not take itself too seriously and there are many carefree moments reminiscent of thor ragnarok and guardians of the galaxy these humorous flashes are staple of the mcu and work for the most part in the marvels the villain dar benn is as bland as they come her character was so forgettable that had to look up the name of the character as was writing this her motivations are strong but the character itself is frustratingly weak as mentioned before the film is packed full of humor would estimate that 80 of these jokes landed with the audience with small portion feeling out of place most of the comedy comes from ms marvel starstruck and overwhelmed persona which lost its appeal very quickly in the first 15 minutes cannot count how many times she screams when the end credits rolled wanted to watch this movie again though it is not top tier entry in the marvel cinematic universe the film is much better than captain marvel ms marvel and other recent projects the strength of the film is the relationship between the three leads while complain about iman vellani over the top enthusiasm her character ms marvel was the heart and soul of the film ', ' the punisher is one of the few decent real marvel characters so was quite excited when heard they were doing new series even if it was the dude from walking dead instead of frank grillo as the punisher himself they have gone away from what made the character great to include story lines that aren important and totally unnecessary sex scene whiny annoying side characters and lead character who is afraid to commit violence the opposite of what made him popular in comics they ve tried to make everything pc and have focused on government conspiracies like every other show yawn from the moment he puts his punisher vest in the bin at the start of the show was concerned and it took 8 episodes before it started to include enough action to make me interested marvel is the entertainment equivalent of apple and people need to stop believing the hype surrounding every new thing they do ', ' scarlett johansson looked so bloody bored throughout the most animated she looked was when she was hitting her head against table which is what was doing after paying to watch this martin scorsese famously said marvel movies were like theme park rides if this was ride it would be that one where fabio had bird fly into his face like bird in the face avoid if you can this film is terrible s who that craig david looking butler she has his acting was hilarious ', ' marvel and netflix ventured together to bring daredevil which turned out to be one hell of show so they continued to get another show and that is jessica jones the show is dark and slow just like daredevil and daredevil picked up the pace during the episode 4 of season 1 but jessica jones gets straight into it from the end of 1st episode the end of episode 1 is bound to make you binge watch the complete series but seriously have no idea why jessica jones is rated as superhero because she doesn have any superpowers to be frank yet another reason to watch jessica jones is because the defenders arrive in 2017 which stars four marvel superheroes daredevil jessica jones iron fist and luke cage ', ' that what would describe the movie as had some cheesy parts and started off slow but once she got going really enjoyed the movie ', ' am not much into superhero tv shows but considering how much enjoyed daredevil on netflix had high expectations from jessica jones but was thoroughly disappointed it could have been great show since it has all the ingredients of dark and intense superhero storyline just like daredevil but what drags this show down is the mediocre writing and acting watched daredevil around six months ago and still remember some of the riveting dialogs from the show but with jessica jones none of the dialogs induce any kind of emotions for me and acting of krysten ritter is average at best think stronger lead would have done loads for the improvement of jessica jones even the acting of supporting characters is nothing to write home about but then they are not getting any favors from the writers generally don binge tv shows watch one episode at time but with jessica jones only get through 15 20 minutes before get thoroughly bored and quit for the day this could have been another in the line of great television put forth by netflix but alas ', ' let me start by saying this show is worthwhile watching but come on guys the current overall rating of 8 6 is really overrated season 1 was great was looking forward watching season 2 with high expectations unfortunately the storyline of season 2 is way too thin for 13 episodes m currently watching episode 10 and still not sure what m actually watching who now the main character and what the plot it just doesn add up and to the acting of frank is really poor he constantly shakes his head in weird way often talks and sounds like bad rambo copycat and looks as if he almost knocked out in round number 10 in boxing without contestant sorry marvel but after very poor season of luke cage and other recent productions it time to first watch it yourselves critically before releasing it ', ' if you love fast paced action anime inspired fight sequences and an amazing cast this show should be in your list as long as you are cool with monkey as the protagonists with human ghost side kick some funny comedy and smart written dialogues performed beautifully infront of the animated asian backdrop full of lethal violence and revenge ', ' this movie is absolute trash they made this movie to let us know that there exists character known as captain marvel the humour is too bad and not funny at all there is no villain in the movie and there no action the fights are really really bad how is she the strongest marvel character when they did not show us what she is capable of thor is always my man lol ', ' too many loopholes in the script the indian music is wrongly placed no good punchlines no real character development seems like few desi actors were added just for marketing purposes farhan akhtar role could ve been played by anyone fawad khan did better in the small screen time he was offered ', ' being die hard fan of marvel who knows all the movies by heart up till end game of course this movie lacks story humor good action literally anything marvel once had you cannot go single 60 second span without wondering why they wouldn remove that scene or comment or bad joke out of the movie just overall awkward and honestly perfect summation of the entirety of the spiral we have seen since tony stark snapped his finger just lazy writing where they once tied the littlest details perfectly together and now they don care about obvious plot holes that make no sense cause all they care about is not getting blackmailed by the trolls of todays world ', ' hands down the most disney of the marvel movies the story feels thin and the whole non villain anti hero craze is getting to be way too much such low stakes that are forced to be life or death m supposed to believe the woman who didn flinch at thanos headbutt is supposed to be in real pickle with this one the performances are pretty great overall but such sloppy and meaningless story felt too much like filler to the next one this phase in marvel will eventually be studied definite post endgame fatigue shines through ones agin with such beloved universe it can be hard to keep the train rolling but this feels like movie phase that people will skip more than watch in the mcu streaming binges ', ' can not say anything more about the avengers the movie just hit all the right spots and lot more it didn only entertain like how brainless popcorn movie would it told great superhero team story the characters were written perfectly the action was spectacular and best of all ever character was joy to watch the story had the perfect balance of comedy action and drama yes there a bit of that too and it good it everything comic book fan would want out of comic book adaptation movie every member of the avengers line up whether super powered or not got the right amount of screen time if you were like me and thought that iron man would get accidentally hog the screen because the trailers made the movie look like iron man and friends your fears will be washed away mark ruffalo also stole the show as banner the hulk if you had few doubts about him playing the character after edward norton was left behind fear not since he does the job well can go as far as saying that ruffalo is the best incarnation of banner so far josh whedon pulled off the impossible he wrote and directed perfect comic book adaptation he created what consider the best superhero movie so far he made the avengers to say anything more would be waste of time just go and watch it ', ' contradictory was the first thought to mind with one explanation of someones appearance counteracted by the 2nd episode the next was its series of side kicks from thor avengers to angel and firefly the best part of this was when it ended m sorry to say had no decent plot character development appears to be very verdone the big soldier will fall in love with the dodgy girl who hes mean on but has feelings for who will turn around and betray then before having conscience and staying true to shield for the start of the second hopefully non existent season another new series atlantis not super but much more worth your time may seem harsh but and m not for crushing creators dream but really don see this taking off perhaps if considering this start from episode 4 that way they may have worked out what they are doing by then ', ' who other than krysten ritter could you imagine being jessica jones she has made this role hers and now could not even imagine any other actress being jessica as long term marvel fan and huge fan of the cinema movies in general its great to see that we get season 2 and hopefully more season to follow well done krysten ', ' the digital graphics for the hulk the battles the portals etc is extraordinary exceptional work this movie is fantastic and the story is perfect ', ' this is different from all the rest marvel on tv can try so many different techniques and this show is the triumphant proof that that works try it you ll love it as long as you go in with an open mind ', ' wish there was an option here to give negative rankings it a total snooze fest acting is strictly average and the direction well there none can believe it the same studio that bought us the avengers ', ' the only thing found disappointing was the fact that only one episode has aired want it all and want it now the acting is superb the scripting directing all above par not going to give specifics to avoid spoilers but there is simply so much to enjoy with this show ', ' this is very dreary show have no idea why people rate it so highly unless their idea of watching something great is watching their laundry spin in the washing machine its very formula show with the obligatory inter racial couple gay couple etc story line is slow many times you just fast forward to get to something interesting notice did not say something good by the 3rd episode was bored to tears krysten ritter the lad actress looks like dirt bag in the show appearing to need bath and really should be eating bowl of spaghetti to get some weight on her in my opinion this series will not make it to second season unless there are enough people who need to use the tv as night light waste of time ', ' after nearly 2 years marvel studious return with black widow solid return that would make every marvel fan happy excited but not satisfied the film is really fun to watch especially that everyone is hungry for marvel film the film starts off in great way that would confuse you bit but in good way because you would be curious to know why and how this is happening which would make you want to watch the film and continue it until the end something that surprised me is that although the film is 2h 15m didn feel that black widow is character that we always wanted to know about her history what happened to her who really is she how did she become black widow the film answered all of that but honestly expected more felt like her story was this typical story of woman who becomes spy agent which in my opinion makes the impact on the character weak and little the plot is just so predictable and there nothing new about it at all you would know where it going and what ll happen also the dialogues were cheesy and gringy at sometimes the villain in the film was barely even there for taskmaster all m saying is that they really ruined the character one of the things that was looking forward to was taskmaster and didn even see him that much the action scenes in the film were so enjoyable and fun especially the opening watching those fight scenes brought up that excitement part in me that was always hungry for marvel action film scarlett johnson performance was obviously great as always she always puts on great performance especially as natasha romanoff florence pugh is one of the best things in the film not just that also her character yelena belova is more than amazing pugh acting was great especially in emotional dramatic scenes david harbour and rachel weisz as well as their characters were also well done the film directing cgi cinematography etc were all normal and nothing special about them which bothered me and wished if they were better so could give the film higher rating because those elements are important to any film and would make difference black widow felt like it is film that is made only to satisfy the fans and not the story and where how it fits into the mcu it is solid return and fun movie to watch especially on the big screen but really expected more or in another way wanted more my rating is 7 10 ', ' didn see netflix daredevil when it first aired with the red hero coming second to yes spiderman and despite my reservation in seeing any rendition of daredevil went ahead and bought the netflix daredevil s1 3 well was blown away was astounded at the exquisite script and the amazing actors who brought the world of daredevil to life with charlie cox as the not so blind yet tortured hero and the amazing vincent onofrio giving tour de force as the kingpin kind of tony soprano meets marvel along with the high production values and awesome fight choreography made my adrenaline soar with quality like this m amazed the series stopped at s3 thankfully there are new series on the horizon and for one can wait huge thank you to all who brought daredevil back to us ', ' from the first multi actor scene itself you realise the actors sound un natural have never heard any indian pakistani talk like that none of my american indian friends talk like that also the story seems bit lame so far would say this is the lamest effort by marvel to capture brown audience kamala the main character herself fails to make an impression on the contrary kamala dad feels more real and convincing the special moment between kamala and bruno feels so made up its the worst romantic moment ve ever seen the granny bangle angle is utterly stupid and the whole power revelation scene cant think of any other movie or tv series this bad ', ' first of all it a mega series top actors and really nice stories with touch of men really like the evolution within the episodes of season and cross season ', ' florence pugh carried the whole film on her back david harbour is always fine actor to watch they ruined taskmaster for me black widow looked like side character even when it her film guess black widow is just side character material to me but hope to see more of yelena she is dope af ', ' enjoyed the movies leading up to this the formula was getting familiar with captain america but the characters were good so who cares was really excited to see where they were going to take these movies because no one had ever done this connected thing before and they were slowly taking their time and it was working so finally the movie that connected everything was here and the whole world is onboard and watching and what are they going to do the same old thing exactly what they had done in the other movies same old generic structure themes action dialogue jokes and story absolutely nothing new don know what was expecting the comics are all the same too they don take any risks or try anything different and they really went for it in this one by having things happen that don make any sense like in the beginning banner can control the hulk then at the end he can with no explanation what out of all the stuff see nerds complain about and that actual plot hole goes unnoticed then with other movies nerds complain about innocent people being killed they take out half of new york city but nobody complains in this movie know there other dumb stuff but my brain forgot about it to make way for useless knowledge of good movies understand these movies being big for boys under 17 but come on so many people plug their nose and swallow this mindless crap without question and disney has the power to do anything that they want and they don use it they don try something new they use cheap tricks to make movies satisfying on cheap emotional level to get people to enjoy them and they have dominated the box office for 10 years and they aren using that responsibility to do anything good they could be getting great message out there but no same old crap why because it works and they ll only do something new if someone else does it first didn they have black widow around forever and when did they decide to give her here own movie oh yeah after dc made wonder woman and it was huge hit this was really the beginning of disney ruining the blockbuster and somehow you tools let it happen you just kept going back getting fed the same old crap again and again ', ' netflix daredevil isn what expected at all it exceeded every bit of mine almost everything from the plots fight scenes and the most importantly the characters are very real and within grasp matthew murdock isn our usual hero he is blind lawyer with the ability to do things right but that doesn mean he isn vulnerable and fragile like normal human being is foggie and karen reacts on the right direction as well as expected from mere human being under the pressure of the situation wilson fisk is very susceptible his background story as well as the one we ve seen him write fisk is the kind of person who is actually scared to speak to the girl he likes and wesley is another friend of his who calls his girlfriend to calm him down in difficult night the variety of culture is wonderfully portrayed as well though pictured as the role of the villains haven exactly read the comic books but have seen multiple comic tv series airing as of the moment and have to admit that this one is by far the best among the rest maybe there are flaws that failed to process but in total all can say is that netflix daredevil solicits relativity and empathy from the viewers because of how realistic everything is constructed upon ', ' after delay lasting 19 months the marvel cinematic universe mcu has returned to the big screen with black widow the film takes place between captain america civil war and avengers infinity war audiences get more of the backstory of natasha romanoff scarlett johansson as we are introduced to her early life before the red room this is not to say that the film is an origin story as it uses her backstory through clever introduction that establishes her family as sleeper agents in ohio before they escape and she and her cover sister are tuned over for conditioning and training since natasha is on the run from the authorities she finds remote location in norway to bide her time this does not last as dangerous adversary known as the taskmaster arrives and sets chain of events into motion natasha has been sent package from her cover sister yelena florence pugh who also went through the red room and became top assassin in the years since she and natasha last saw one another despite her mixed feelings natasha ventures to budapest and confronts yelena who in turn reveals the package she sent her contains compound that can free the other black widows from the control of the red room which despite natasha insistence is still very much alive as is the head of the institute which she is convinced she killed long ago with taskmaster and other widows hot on their trail natasha and yelena are forced to seek the help of their former father the imprisoned hero red guardian david harbour and their cover mother melina rachel weisz to find the location of the new red room free the widows and end the program once and for all what follows is an engaging story with solid action and effects that remains at its core character story as natasha attempts to reconcile her cover family with her new avengers family and the pain of her upbringing and conditioning marvel resisted calls from some to release the film on disney last year when the pandemic caused multiple delays to the planned release dates this decision to me was very wise as this is film that needs to be seen and heard on the big screen as it is an experience that is best experienced in cinema with others while many attempts were made over the decades to adapt comic heroes to film and television most of them came up lacking and disappointed fans of the source material marvel for over decade has continued to succeed as they have clear plan cast well and have engaging characters that develop over time black widow fills in missing gap of time in the mcu well and also sets up future adventures as scene in the credits clearly links two of the live action disney series and shows that the long term plan for the mcu continues and incorporates the film and television series well from the moment the marvel intro and music appeared on the screen until the very end black widow was very enjoyable and engaging blockbuster adventure that shows marvel at the top of their game and why they continue to set event level movies not to miss 4 stars out of 5 ', ' less superhero story and more of crime drama daredevil is fantastic way to bridge the huge gap between street level violence and aliens invading new york city with the marvel universe populated by larger than life characters gods hulks billionaires super spies we finally have fantastic depiction of the gritty underworld that flies under the radar of the big boys beautifully shot wonderfully acted with fight scenes that are just plain flawless daredevil is gigantic home run for marvel and netflix while the comic fan is sure to love this the average viewer has plenty of meat to chew on in this series brilliant lawyers drug cartels corrupt cops love interests the list is endless the true beauty of the show though is the cinematography it dark edgy and fitting for the subject matter it makes you feel as if you re rolling around in the muck with matt and you re knee deep in the filth of hell kitchen bottom line netflix is putting out some gems this is yet another one ', ' oh my god the avengers was big disappointment to me can believe how doll and bored was during the 2 hours and 20 minutes playtime of the movie the directing was so bad and think the director thinks the audience are so stupid or retarded to believe those cheap story lines or cheap jokes or even cheap plot the script was so cheap and boring and the characters didn blend with each other at all m not even impressed by the special effects of the movie think men 3 or spider man showed lot more special effect than this one nearly enjoyed the last scene of the entire movie but this was not enough for such movie who earned unbelievable high ratings finally when knew that the director has never directed such super hero movies and he has only directed for the tv like buffy series know why this movie sucked still can believe how it got 8 6 really ', ' love this show keep em coming marvel just like this and captain marvel loving it can wait for she hulk only idiots and morons don like this show marvel knows what they re doing and hope they keep this up ', ' this is probably the best if not the greatest portrayal of the punisher have ever seen ', ' after dreadful obi wan kenobi episodes and not fan of any avengers movie was not sure if would even bother watching one episode of ms marvel glad did alive and funny warm and hilarious it reminded me of into the spider verse made with such an attention to details and love for the comics and genre my daughter at 11 feel asleep watching obi wan wish it was me but she also enjoyed this even if bit younger than target audience then again am some decades too old for the target audience so guess it evens out hope the next 5 will have the same standard as this one ', ' you can not keep away your eyes from this movie marvel strikes again ', ' don see the negative reviews actually the movie is pretty interesting and funny must watch ', ' just finished watching the movie dont get why they hate captain marvel its total package funny exciting great action and more ignore the the haters just watch the movie you ll never regret it promise ', ' listen hate brie larson but let be honest the first 100 reviews were fake separating this film in 3 acts would define the first as confusing the second and the third great but nothing so special it is great movie not top 10 marvel but certeainly good experience samuel jackson is so good in this movie certainly my favorite character in captain marvel movie ', ' discount wannabe archer with mix of wanna be tony stark with whole lotta useless forced and lame out of place one liners this show tries too hard in all categories and people talking to the monkey and explaining intricate detailed plans while he grunts and screams is super dumb ', ' captain marvel 2019 is marvel first attempt to create female hero and to also tie some loose ends from past movies the main quality this movie has is the story and the plot twist marvel created handful of amazing movies unfortunately captain marvel 2019 is not one of them the movie suffers of multiple issues don know if it the actor or the direction but brie larson as captain marvel did not click with me think that she did fine job but she did not leave an impression on me compared to robert downey jr or as iron man or chris hemsworth as thor the moment saw those guys on screen just knew there is no other human being capable of replacing them the fighting scenes are average thus they were bit of let down was expecting more of marvel since they raised the bar so high with spectacular movies such as captain america the winter soldier marvel made the same mistake as in black panther the hero is way too strong the only real satisfying and memorable wins are the ones you have to fight and struggle for conclusion captain marvel 2019 is decent movie but compared to the rest of the marvel movies it lacks the charm clear strong message and also tension making it lower tier movie ', ' hard to express how off the mark this one is admit that didn watch the ms marvel series because m not 10 but her character was just annoying and juvenile phase 1 3 including the first captain marvel was made with adults for adults or big kids but this could ve been on boomerang why does every latest marvel movie or series need child lead antman thor hawkeye captain marvel it destroying the product the kid is annoying the story is poor the trio doesnt work and there no suspense the antagonist is not scary or interesting the cat was interesting in the first one but is overused here don get me started on the musical interlude whoever thought that was good idea needs to find new profession brie larson and samuel jackson had nothing to work with even my kids disliked it ', ' this series is disgrace in the super hero series it is clearly have one perception that is not entertaining at all have been marvel fan but it clearly time to move on bye bye marvel ', ' great movie not really political good balance of seriousness and short quips of comedy ', ' although did not have very high expectations for this movie did not expect it to be this disappointing most admit though it is marvel movie and it had its memorable moments but the disappointment outweighed the memorable parts tremendously and not to mention complete change to one of my most beloved super villains ', ' the show does an excellent job of laying the foundation for what can lead to deeper exploration into sociopathology psychopathology charisma and responsibility what is now seemingly endless fascination by the media is presented in challenging way it is wholly refreshing that the sexual manipulation play book is rarely used in this series if ever by either the male or female characters it is also wholly refreshing to find inflicted direct violence used less as means of manipulation rather than suggestion but when used that it can be employed by either sex finally thank god real sex is portrayed on the screen women actually taking the lead and both women and men enjoying themselves in the bedroom ', ' watched this after finishing falcon and winter soldier wow did marvel going down now they are equally boring okay some good thing about this movie alexei and yelena are the true star of this movie their performance are great background music is good visually entertaining decent plot but the main star is nowhere to find the black widow is underperformed actually they have good plot showing her background bit twist in the end about the main enemy daughter but they don show it deep enough to make us connected to black widow but this is good enough to watch and spend your night with your friend or family maybe because avenger has set the bar so high other superhero movie feels boring right now ', ' this has been one of the best films that marvel has ever made great watch for anyone who wants to get into the marvel movies great watch would recommend to anyone wanting to have good time ', ' just today watched ms marvel ep 1 it interesting how storyline of teenage pakistani girl is shown in really fun maner therefore it just reminds me of my school days where used to be that guy who was in his own fictional world ', ' hello that review is specially for the people who aren fans of superheroes films m not superheroes films fan specially on marvel films the best was spiderman prefer dc comics but in that time enjoy the film the film was great whit good history and good special effects too if you want to see superheroes film but realistic that isn your film maybe you go to see dc comics film because marvel had crazy unrealistic ideas but if you like superpowers and the magician that your film like specially this film because appears many different heroes whit different powers and different attitude before saw that film think that it can be good film but now ve different opinion maybe you when finish the film your opinion change too pd that my first review and m not from english country maybe ve grammatical mistakes ', ' first off can believe watched the whole thing well just the first season but needed closure and to see his silly costume good lord the writing in this thing sucks the acting sucks the whole thing is terrible cliche m going to go read frank miller daredevil stuff wash the bad taste out and kept hearing how much people loved it know better than to listen to hype this wasn even fun and bad just bad bad bad bad yecch barf wince can believe ate the whole thing haha ', ' so don know lot about the hero other then whats been in animated series but is this really the same ms marvel power wise its green lantern pretty straight up not the mr fantastic done right at it is in the animated story seems pretty straight forward and when you seen the first episode you know whats going to happen so over all it fells like high budget disney show hoping for hannah montana to show up in post credit ', ' when we observe supporting character mere mortal defenceless human being in joss

his disposal large hammer and indeed pays for it with their life you know you re not mining particularly intelligent territory this largely disappointing 2012 effort begins in quasi area 51 style military base where mysterious blue cube is pulsating enough for race of monsters who dress like the creatures in stargate but look like something you might have caught in an episode of power rangers located on the other side of the universe to be attracted to it like stargate although with the roles here reversed tom hiddleston loki turns out nordic mythology was the one true religion emerges from portal created by the cube into this top secret laboratory and steals the cube in order to fabricate it so that the rest of the war mongering creatures can come through at later date to destroy all human life measure as to his menace and ability is put across in two ways first the ease to which he neuters the human beings finding no threat in automatic weaponry and converting them to his cause through magic staff second the way in which he is framed so as to encompass an eagle like emblem in the background actually the badge of the good guys as he utters freedom is life great lie something designed to invoke hitler like personality with what resembles the german national adler behind him later on there will be strange allusion to nazi germany again when in germany of all places he forces score of german citizens to kneel before him with one brave citizen standing up and making some allusion to how there will always exist people like you people who want power had it

to offer further retort would have recommended he hop on over to the middle east where they re heavily into sprawling themselves out on the floor because deity tells them to loki philosophy on human

heard of the versailles treaty nor that hitler commanded not for people to kneel before him merely salute out of respect and recognise that his policies had made germany nation that was rich enough to fool itself into thinking the great war never even happened after loki theft an otherwise needless character played by samuel jackson whose purpose in the film is to look cool wearing an eye patch and

avengers tossed in is an archer and an expert in kung fu because they offer an alternative way to kill an enemy to the main heroes who can do nothing more than keep blowing them up or swatting them away with their power the film is mostly noise but good looking noise made more bearable by the wonderful editing during the action sequences particularly when flying battleship loses its ability to fly mid air and new york city is besieged during the finale wherein it is clear what each of our protagonists are doing where they are in relation to each other and how they are going about fulfilling their tasks amidst the elements the film is essentially superman ii with multiple supermen concoction of 1994 street fighter wherein each character is designated fight with every other one despite some of them being on the same side with stephen norrington damp 2003 squib the league of extraordinary gentlemen don mind action films but action films with great deal of special effects are often somewhat tiresome affairs this 2012 feature is no exception here over the last 25 years hollywood has proved time and time again that the best action films carry with them that grounded sense of base level operation being propelled by realistic heroes this is why the street highway and inner city set event movies of speed or die hard with vengeance will always be superior to marvel avengers assemble films that do not rely on tremendous amount of special effects but provide you with enough chase pomp and bullet time to have you feel as if you are caught in crossfire should be unfortunate to catch this good looking although ultimately vacuous 2012 feature sense you will be disappointed was left dissatisfied in being asked to believe that there could exist form of authentic theism and the existence of an alien species elsewhere in the universe without any of it being explored left perplexed at the tremendous amount of science on display in iron man suit and bruce banner fascinating ability to shift into separate molecular form the likes of which essentially smashes the concept of creationism it is harmless inoffensive and does indeed fly past nicely but there nothing here to get excited about ', ' ll make it simple best points action scenes scarlett johansson iron man hulk low points captain america went to see this movie in 2d because don like the 3d but after awhile was regretting it because the scenes are awesome and must be really great in 3d even in 2d the heroes and creatures seem to come inside the cinema captain america is so wrongly portrayed here it a mix of the old one of the comics in the 60 with the new one of civil war when the best comics of captain america were in the 80 and 90 he supposed to be man not kid he supposed to have strong voice not sweet women lovable voice he supposed to be bulk not normal gym guy he supposed to have an armor that shows respect and represents dignity not plastic suit that looks carnival suit for kids he supposed to throw his shield like it was easy and light for him and not heavy or with much effort the shield it supposed to be an extension of his arm and not his shoulder he supposed to be leader and not someone who tells jokes he never makes anyone laugh he the moral standards of every group something that no iron man thor hulk or other hero can do as him because apart from his serum and special abilities he represents humanity at his best not playboy business man or god or monster he representing the best of mankind and human spirit he more then soldier and last but not least he never takes gun and starts shooting apart from that because captain america is one of my heroes can give 9 to this movie all the scenes are great loki isn that good as everyone says here god doesn spit to glass while talking you don even know if gods have saliva it not cool but anyway think it deserves 9 5 because can give that and although it doesn respect captain america spirit right it an awesome movie 10 stars best part of the movie is the scene when hulk starts fighting the bad guys you won get better excitement and thrill then this not even on the hulk movies what shame for those two ', ' first off this is based on just one episode so throwing bunch of shade at whole miniseries on day one based on the first episode seems really dumb but anyhow really enjoyed this first episode of ms marvel even as grown ass man kamala is relatable iman vellani did fantastic job and the animation that pops up at different times during the show feels refreshing really hope she doesn read any of these comments because calling 16 year old girl trash is just revolting grow up people you don have to enjoy the show but don attack the actors are ms marvel powers different from the comics sure does that matter think we have to wait and see on that one but for an origin story thought this was cute fun and entertaining ', ' most childish movie ever from marvel this movie should come with disclaimer that it is only for kids under 10 and the 6th episode was the most childish thing have ever seen ', ' the issue this series faces is that it on disney within the marvel universe and therefore has all the older mu fans watching and not relating this series is disney series aimed at younger mu fans and relating to teenage school kids it an entertaining teen series maybe don watch if you re an avid marvel fan but let the kids watch it and get them interested in the universe we all love ', ' this show is refreshing especially coming from marvel as it one of kind think the story line duration background music is all lit keep at it hope to see more of this series in future as well ', ' expected the worst for this movie really did expected just bunch of special effects and no story was pleasantly surprised that this movie is actually very very good and yes was right about the special effects but this movie does have heart and story liked the way they brought all of the characters together even liked the soundtrack highly recommend this movie think it ranks as perhaps the best comic book superhero movie ever made and ve seen them all used to think that the 1978 superman the movie and 1981 superman ii couldn be surpassed in 2002 the first spiderman movie came close to being as good as the first two superman movies but still believed the superman movies still tops until this movie this is the comic book movie that finally dethroned the first two superman movies in my humble opinion yes think it is that good ', ' enjoy all of the episodes but some seasons are little much this last season 6 they try to make the main character chloe bennet blonde it kinda like taking ginger and making them brunette it doesn work chloe is the perfect example of brunette beauty if you want to bring blonde into the mix do that but leave chloe hair alone ', ' it funny and full of action florence pughis fantastic as yelena seriously don know why this has so many bad reviews ', ' was ready for nice binge watch marathon after having seen daredevil and other marvel heroes but the punisher was like running marathon in the first 20 would ever make it to the end although it well made it is so slow maybe it is because of the title the punisher you expect action with title like that at least not in the first half of the series since fell asleep in episode 7 you can sleep recommend it very much or you can watch political debate ', ' well this show is no earth mightiest heroes or avengers assemble but it is still good enough show for kids most of the episode just contain spider man explaining an adventure he has and what he has learned from it and that is pretty much it well am not massive fan of canadian animation especially their previous marvel shows but this not bad ', ' watch most of the super hero films and tv shows this consistently has us on the edge of our seats it the main reason keep netflix going charlie cox is excellent as matt murdoch but vincent onofrio is superb as wilson fisk and would play main villain as well on the big screen in my opinion brill watch even if the superhero genre isn always your cup of tea ', ' when was boy read the original marvel daredevil apparently it was revision of 1940 comic of all the superheroes marvel had devised daredevil seemed like the only real possibility to my childish mind of becoming superhero apart from the heightened senses that the radiation gave him when blinded he was still an ordinary man with no superpowers batman was stinking rich so he could have all the contraptions he used but daredevil only had his wits and fists in an early issue saw that matt murdock trained as gymnast to increase his athletic powers as well as having been the son of boxer as 14 year old joined the high school gymnastics team to start my career as superhero of course no such thing happened instead fell in love with the gymnastics training and pursued career as coach watched ben afflick in his movie version of daredevil and was mystified regarding electra had stopped reading comics when was 19 and this story line of daredevil dating electra came about after that watching the netflix tv series turned out to be an addictive surprise netflix has drawn upon those early marvel stories but have made the story an adult drama that has visceral reality about it he may be superhero but matt gets the snot kicked out of him as much as he beats the tar out of the bad guys in the comic book you rarely see him harmed but in the tv series the falls and assaults on him stun him and harm him as it would in reality am grateful for this netflix adaptation of my childhood favorite of superheroes my wife can not watch it because of the intensity of the violence but find the series gripping ', ' this end of season 4 and the start of season 5 are complete mess watching until first season this show was an all public action with excellent choices actors authors directors guidelines etc going virtual plot for long are not good ideas suicindind this show with that kind of guidance equal as how can kill it authors revolts yourselves is it show specialist at the helm now its kill this show because good ideas have to be ended serious an all public show is big income for networks why ruin it producers rules that ok but creation and show running logic should not be sacrifice for nonsense again good idea killed why ', ' enjoyed this movie much more than expected to the dialogue was razor sharp and the characters were excellent scarlett johansson really shines along with brilliant cast and florence pugh in particular is stellar ', ' this tv series is masterpiece it is by far the best superhero like show it has some wonderful scenes you don usually have in series where you just enjoy the picture season 1 was my favorite season in all the series yes watched breaking bad and season 2 continued and upgraded it season two had the best fighting scenes best romantic scenes and best redemption scene ever saw on tv but it is not just the directing actors are brilliant story is interesting and has lot of background on people and most importantly the bad guys are not just bad you see them from both sides and you may even like the bad guy even cheer for him and at the same time still like the daredevil villains also last more than one part so you met them more and they are not just crazy people who want to destroy everything it is also not generic you know all those shows that hero fights villain in minute 20 loses and then beats him at the end daredevil can always lose the fight you do know he won die but that is must all the costars can also be in danger daredevil also shows lot of weaknesses he gets injured needs help show also doesn limit it self with time so that helps and they stretch some parts and finish the story but still manage to end on cliffhanger to summarize it this is must watch for all of you who love shows like arrow jessica jones and other superhero vigilante shows even if you are not fan of these kind of shows and you just want to watch great series this is definitely one of the best ones ', ' it isn quite so bad it good show it is just plain bad the main character kamala is completely spoiled and unlikable she is basically an unfunny less funny green lantern she has zero motivation or character development she worships super heroes and look shiny bracelet now she just da bestest it looks like freshman film projects in direction and writing mean freshman in highschool the production values are great though oooohhhh shiny lights strong pass on episode 2 and the rest of the series marvel what has happened to you why do you keep failing so hard when victory is already in your grasp its like watching train wreck marvel comics failed now their movies tv is failing why won they learn ', ' am fan of just about everything marvel but not this what possible reason could they have to produce this childish waste of time if you say it for the kids you re ridiculous so is basically every marvel movie show that exists excluding few aka logan and deadpool to name few figured that it would only be matter of time before the inevitable downslope of worthwhile material that happens whenever disney takes control of anything ', ' after seeing the trailer of the movie and the names and numbers of stars in the movie with great status as no 1 top movies and sales of 207 for just the first week with ranking 8 8 took my family to the theater to watch it the story is nice but the way it was produced make almost as reading book with lot of chatting between main characters many other movies like the dark night or iron man 1st movie where great cause of the sum of action but in this movie think the producer should think again to use all those stars wisely the action part is not shown as any one well expect from move full of stars of great power and ability ', ' this series sucks and it has nothing to do with the kids adult story debate script is weak some characters are borderline obnoxious performances are mediocre and the teen standing up to super conservative family clich wears down fast don know why but that clich is being used everywhere feels like the apocaliptic natural disaster mania from the late 90s in spite of that the color pallette is beautiful and production is also outstanding ', ' one of the best marvel series every season ist better this show must go on hope so ', ' it hard to write review about something that was so poor when what we ve been given is mish mash of weak plotlines and weaker characters the acting can be blamed and the protagonists do their best to keep the pace going but what they have been given is story that seems to have no idea what it wants to do the action sequences are boring the villain is extremely weak and given very little to do and the heart that filled so many mcu films before it has been replaced with scripted mess that doesn make us want to invest in anything that happening the end credit scene adds intrigue to what comes next but certainly doesn mask what has just been witnessed marvel need to go back to basics showing us characters that we deeply care for without losing the heart that kept us engaged for so long ', ' marvel character diversity expansion has been very nice improvement to the entertainment industry and movies like shang chi black panther and moon knight have all been lots of fun to watch so being pakistani was excited to hear that ms marvel was coming out and the main character would be of pakistani descent unfortunately my excitement quickly fizzled out not long into watching the series the actresses and actors all did great job but the series just didnt have the cool wow factor that was expecting overall the show just seemed to juvenile for me and even my son and daughter who are 7 and 12 respectively didnt enjoy it in fact they both stopped watching half way through the series like one of the reviews said it seemed alot more disney than marvel definitely lacked the thrilling excitement that is common with marvel comics and most of the movies they have made ', ' not black widow know leave it even for marvel fans ', ' m really not sure why people are giving it 1 or 2 stars it was really good but there were parts thought the cgi was lacking and little clunky people can expect this to be comic accurate as this is to fill in the gap in the mcu storyline all the cast played there parts very well and scarlet was great d encourage anyone who has watched it yet to give it go definitely worth watch ', ' great show and entertaining you eventually enjoy watching it with good cgi and effects decent story line great entertainer for kids and that is what their target audience is am excited to see how marvel will make all these recent characters work together in their upcoming series or movies ', ' this is the kind of show that starts of strong then drags bit but ends pretty well mostly it has some great visuals relatable enough character who comes from colourful background with struggles that can be related to even by those who don share her culture that said find that there are times when the comedy doesn quite hit or when it drags just little bit and the ending feels bit rushed still from the newest phase of marvel this series is one of my favourites so far even though it isn perfect feel like this is what shows featuring people other than white should be not ones that hand down white role to people of colour but rather ones that have them in their own role while being treated neither as something exotic nor as just white painted with colour she a teen girl who deals with the typical struggles many teenagers do while also having lot of things going on that link to the culture and environment she lives in she can dress like other girls because her parents disagree but in her case that partly down to religion she partakes in religious activities but also idolises non religious heroes you don have to be from her specific culture to understand her but they also did seem to at least try and represent the culture somewhat though ll admit that don know the accuracy to which it is portrayed mostly just like how refreshing this is both aesthetically and with the influences in the mcs life ', ' this show is thoughtful interesting well acted and overall great don know why so many people are upset it well worth watching way better than moon knight which was boring ', ' admit it been while since have seen this film but have yet to give proper review hopefully this review can trigger the awesome feelings you had when watching the avengers this is what the marvel movies have been leading up to that is every marvel movie excluding the spider man trilogy the amount of hype behind this movie was tremendous while waiting in line for the avengers the usher at the theater tells us that this is the best movie have seen in 5 years that being said it extremely hard to go into this film without any expectations so the question then is was the avengers good if can would call it marvel ous let start with what really enjoyed the two strongest parts of the avengers are the beginning and the end when the film opens we get to see the heros in their respective environments and the opening scene with black widow stands out as one of the best after loki threatens earth the avengers team has to assemble watching the team finally come together after waiting so many years is special moment now the end was good because we finally get to see the avengers work together as team while it took the entire movie for the marvel heros to figure out that they are stronger as unit than as individuals it worth the wait how the camera panned across each hero who was doing something that effected the next person was stunning to me this felt the most like an actual comic book of video game the humor and writing really stand out as good found myself laughing lot more than thought at this movie and that works for this film the marvel movies have always been bright and very light hearted at times and the script really made that aspect shine through the two sides of the hulk the hulk was one of the best parts of this movie along with the relationship between captain america and iron man hope they set up the civil war story however if had one flaw with the avengers it would be mark ruffalo as bruce banner honestly thought both previous actors bana and norton played the part better know there is ton more content to this film but should save that for when get the film again on blu ray and have fresh viewing overall the avengers is superhero film done right everything just seemed to mesh and fall right into place however am not giving it 10 just yet because the dark knight rises is coming out soon and believe that it will be better than the avengers 9 0out of 10 better clench up legolas ', ' this is an example of successful movie the successful movie is when you watch it breathtaking easy watching and yet this is movie very hard to make the hell of making such movie is to write handful of protagonists each having separate movie of their own into single movie where all of them should be main characters and equally hell of job yet of all avengers movies including civil war this one is the best so this is one of the movies you wish it never ends but first want to praise the role of cobie smulders she is very sexy and played her role of maria hill very and very sexy d very much like to have such girlfriend in me life so the task was to make many episodes like video clips where each of the characters have single and impressive dialogue and acting then to unite them all into movie personally after watching it three times m big fan of scarlett so first time was all into her second time watched it liked the performance of tom hiddleston well this is movie where all actors are just perfect tom there is something ideal for him to take the role of loki you will never see him as villain you will understand him and have compassion this is what marvel is all about but today as watched it the third time it was all about the connection about understanding about to be together strange but this third time noticed the trust captain america tried to have to this team strange and unknown to him sacrifice iron man made their mutual partnership you know marvel movies are not about fun comics blockbuster they have meaning this movie was about understanding and to be together despite all odds dialogue between so different people and about not to be alone but to be together this is why love marvel movies so much they have this humanity in it beauty of humanity in all of the rage of blockbuster so today it is about thor still loving his half brother widow saving arrow iron man and captain working together hulk trying so much to be good man he always is this is not thanks god just superhero movie this movie about understanding and god it ends too soon the movie thank you marvel it is marvel the fairy tale not about heroes but about us ', ' farce and absurdity mixed with cranberries only occasionally diluted with jokes that can hardly be called successful and often meaningless battles the russians in the film are worse than the nazis everything moves predictably in the spirit of the russophobic red sparrows and solov russian sadists russian criminals russian alcoholics although from the solo album about russian romanov is my ass traitor would be stupid ', ' marvel movies really have fallen apart haven they this is definitely one of the worst marvels movie have seen out of all the marvel movies had watched there really isn too much to say about the movie because the marvels is pretty much like almost every single marvel movie but the writing humor direction and performances are pretty much all over the place director nia dacosta has made little woods which liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place the special effects are kind of rough on the edges the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances despite pretty good cast they aren very good brie larson is an actress like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking the other performances as well including the child performances the story isn interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting with short runtime the movie surprisingly was really boring do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked overall it bad ', ' first this is just fun show must everything related to superheroes be the fate if the universe and super dramatic it a show about 15 year old that gets powers and to add to the complexity muslim girl most of it may not be life and death drama but it very well acted appropriate special effects and very easy to follow story line ', ' maybe after all stephen dorff had good point it a video game but it was great video game the actors were great really like florence perfomance all the cast did great job but you can but to pay attention for florence accent scarlett deserved the movie ', ' m huge fan of comics and when movie is made need to see it no matter the number of stars it gets or the budget everyone talked about this movie like it something huge but m not so impressed the actors were great but for an action heroes not enough action the first hour and half was just torture with mindless talk and few fights fought in dark and the end was similar to the ending of iron man the same going in the high altitude and free falling mean you have that massive budget and you couldn come up with something different but the ending is only one of the many things that could have been made differently just little more imagination and less effects still the star wars stand unbeatable ', ' good show unnecessary rated low due to haters is decent and fun good young lead actress higher than my expectations for it marvel is stepping up their game ', ' an amazing evergreen movie our favorite superheroes whom we watched in solo movies for the1st time they team up to protect earth from the enemies that come from another world an outstanding and engaging storyline with smart direction visual effects background music costume locations everything is just perfect and the actors done really great job specially robert downey jr cries evans cries hemsworth mark rufallow and tom hiddelstone and the last battle scene that was marvelous ', ' think this movie garnered more attention because of the lawsuit but watched it and it was ok but nothing great found myself bored more times than not ', ' this movie proves that captain marvel is great and funny character think every marvel fan should watch this movie ', ' found it dull pointless uninteresting and frankly not worth watching don know if it supposed to be aimed at children but it certainly not aimed at me the main family are all painted as total idiots dismissed ', ' honestly would give this movie 4 or 5 stars the 1 star gave is only to average out all the 10 stars it got earlier avengers is no different from other superhero movies there are bunch of people with superpowers there is villain who wants to destroy the planet he starts with the united states all evil powers that plan to destroy the planet begins with the united states and most of the damage is done only to portion of new york and all the superpowers combined defeat the villain required amount of drama humor etc are placed as necessary nothing more somehow everyone loves this good reason to believe that paid reviews can affect the overall rating to good extent ', ' among 2012 summer blockbusters no other titles have garnered as much attention and praise as avengers directed by joss whedon this superhero ensemble film marked groundbreaking moment in the mcu bringing together iconic characters for spectacle of action and mayhem while undeniably entertaining it hard to ignore the lingering feeling that the film reputation might have overstated its impact the premise is simple yet enticing earth mightiest heroes iron man captain america thor hulk black widow and hawkeye join forces to thwart an alien invasion orchestrated by loki the film success however leans heavily on its presentation of the heroes collective camaraderie and of course the action packed set pieces from technical standpoint avengers hits all the right notes the special effects and choreographed battles are visual spectacle catering to fans of explosive action and superhuman feats joss whedon direction seamlessly juggles the ensemble cast allowing each hero to showcase their signature powers and personality quirks yet this triumph often overshadows more pressing question is there more substance beneath the surface the film narrative ambition doesn quite match its technical prowess avengers leans heavily on its tried and true formula where heroes initially clash due to differing viewpoints only to unite against common threat this formulaic structure while staple of superhero storytelling fails to provide the depth and nuance that could elevate the film beyond mere popcorn entertainment one of the key criticisms directed at avengers is its lack of profound themes or underlying messages unlike some of its mcu counterparts which delve into complex moral dilemmas and societal reflections avengers predominantly rests on the laurels of spectacle and the thrill of seeing beloved characters share the screen the film humor while often enjoyable occasionally undercuts moments that could have carried more weight character development too takes backseat to the film action oriented focus while each hero brings their own charisma to the table their arcs largely remain within the confines of their established personas moments of introspection or growth tend to be fleeting leaving audiences hungry for more substantial evolution in conclusion avengers is by no means bad movie its status as cornerstone of the mcu is well deserved considering its pioneering feat of assembling beloved characters on such grand scale however the film reputation as game changer might overshadow its shortcomings it an entertaining watch that delivers on its promise of action and hero camaraderie but its lack of deeper thematic exploration and character depth prevents it from ascending to the echelons of true cinematic greatness ', ' the special effects were not great all along some are awesome others are just plain awful the music and sound throughout the movie is awkward and lacks consistency and transitions between scenes am sad to see that the movie was made quite roughly in some parts would have waited longer for truly great captain marvel movie that makes the hero justice for such big franchise it would have been possible but it seems that they care more about polishing endgame rather than captain marvel they had all the tools and didn make it awesome watchable enjoyable but not as extraordinary ', ' this movie was soo soo good highly recommended to all of you don listen to the haters it really good and the post credits will make you excited for avengers endgame ', ' black widow easily the worst of the movies from mcu think have watched all the 21 or 22 movies but this is definitely the most boring of all no other avengers but for the black widow lengthy very dragging too ', ' the marvels is another generic superhero movie based on marvel comics the script is simple and unpretentious it does not even seek to tell quality story the dialogues are mainly bad seeking to use easy and bland comedy in most of the scenes the cg special effects look fake for most of their appearance the cinematography is conventional and few visuals manage to stand out the music composed for the film goes unnoticed nia dacosta direction is weak she had achieved great first feature film and now with her second film she fails to direct it the acting is average this is due to how poorly the characters are written the only really fun thing in this movie is goose the cat and something to highlight is the animation during the end credits the rest is just production that doesn achieve anything special one more marvel movie without any news ', ' yes do believe in cultural representation in shows and movies im huge advocate for cultural representation but just because this show has it does not make it good show the first episode is horrendous kamala khan is not likeable the actress isn the best her character is selfish annoying and cringey hopefully it gets better but unfortunately dont see this show getting any better ', ' loved jessica jones and gave it 9 the series captivated me from start to finish with an engaging narrative and protagonist who seems incredibly real jessica jones is multifaceted character who displays full range of emotions anger joy sadness and even lust she is not portrayed as typical heroine but rather as complex and troubled woman who possesses powers this more human and realistic approach is fascinating and makes the series incredibly authentic each episode reveals more about her internal struggles and her efforts to deal with past traumas which creates deep connection with the audience the series perfectly balances action drama and character development making jessica jones memorable and unique experience ', ' marvel have serious problem with running out of content in urge to create more number of shows they creating trash ms marvel is worst written show so far in disney iron fist is way better than the ms marvel characters in this show are like characters in dreams they act so random the main motives of the characters are changes in seconds ', ' wish would ve read the reviews first or at least check them after the first 10 minutes one of the worst movies ve ever seen no plot no character development it like they struggled to fill in every minute of it the dancing and singing scene was umbareable to watch apparently cannot submit review shorter than 600 characters even though don know what more to say about this horrible movie much like it please stop reading my review don waste your time needless to say that will not pay to see another marvel film after their greed exceeded common sense with thor and this one ', ' another good marvel movie my only complaint is that it could have had more of phil coulson it definitely doesn follow the typically superhero origin story which enjoyed and lead to some unexpected moments as expected it has huge implications for the entire marvel cinematic universe can see being set in the 1990s some younger people will not get the technology pop culture jokes its great addition to the marvel cinematic universe ', ' terrible finale for good beginning the first season was good but the second season was so bad that especially the end nothing unexpected no creativity in the plot ', ' all the people complaining that this show seems to be for kids seem to have missed the point it is as 42 year old white man don think am the demographic that this show was aiming for but still enjoyed it iman vellani who plays kamala khan is entirely likeable and the story while bit all over the place was interesting enough to keep watching episode 5 does seem bit shoehorned in but that not the end of the world there are so many shows and movies out there aimed at specific audiences you can start crying just because one wasn made with you in mind ', ' was not impressed wouldn go as far to say it was as bad as transformers 2 and 3 but it was aiming to be story wise it was piece of crap typical good vs bad acting not so good the only thing that was protecting these flaws was the special effects buildings fell things blew up blah blah blah the end of the movie was meant to be epic but it was very underwhelming was thinking that this was meant to be an advanced alien race also thought that cpt america was meant to be badass but it turns out he wears pyjamas not chainmail it was memorable only because it was so disappointing ', ' am astounded at how bad this was it plays like low budget soap opera everything looks like it is cheap but like they are trying to make it look glamorous and everything is so overdramatized and cliche every little bit of dialogue just seems so try hard it cringe worthy was looking forward to this but couldn even get into the first episode it was just so painful to watch the fact that it is getting high ratings just shows how low the standards are today there just no art in this pitiful ', ' like so many others had high hopes for this show coulson was such fun ironic character it was great to find way to resurrect him there have been times in this series that that character has shone through but it seems they are either cutting his best scenes most of the time or giving him pretty stale dialogue and directing there isn enough coulson and way too much skye most of the first season was just the skye show and it looks like it devolving into that again coulson should be the main character and skye minor character not the other way around also the story line isn very satisfying it keeps jumping around and is pretty grim miss coulson idealism and humor often he just hesitant and confused know the character been through lot of trauma but don watch the series for that want to see him coping and succeeding with style and flair want this show to be good experience like the marvel movies have been hope someone gets this message and makes the show different ', ' really average after the first season suprised how it has such good rating while other much better shows have much worse reviews well guess its all in the eye of the beholder ', ' so right off the bat must say thought fanboys were just hating on this movie but have to admit the liver is pretty bad that is if you are the historical norm fan base males both older and younger but that in and of itself doesn make this movie bad after all watched and enjoyed plenty 1970 and 1980 superhero movies many made for tv release and even then they were corny and nothing any adult would watch but that the point they were aimed at kids the marvels is just as corny just better props and cgi but like mentioned before it audience based my wife groans when marvel anything comes on yet when this played she said nothing but good things like laugh repeat lines and be excited at girls kicking butt take this as the marvel genre and action in general is so depleted of content women like or having the cast be predominantly women and women very thing else being subservient to their mission plot script something that up until the last decade was always the reverse as guy find no character really like because for one am an adult and this was clearly made for kids even by marvel standards it plays more like tv show if made for tv movie and because it caters more to women it felt soapy while it was solid 1 for me rate it 4 because it a step in the right direction where more lanes if entertainment are being opened so everyone can identify with the lead actor but for the money they spent in this movie at better quality is needed for the ladies if my house and if made better think all audiences might have enjoyed it there is really strong female characters and stories that have been made use those as blueprints ', ' feel like saw different movie than other reviewers thought the movie was very good and well done balanced drama action and comedy very well as always jude law and samuel jackson was fantastic was very impressed with brie larson and thought she as well did an amazing job definitely one of my favorite marvel movies ', ' don waste time can even be bothered wasting time going into why this is so bad ', ' the non humans are so much stronger that if they decided to storm shield all the team member would be wipe out the script writer should do better job in balancing the power out also the distrust and bickering among st the shield team is enough of self destructive momentum they don need others to destroy them weak minded and distrustful bunch their defenses are weak and each of the shield members are easily manipulated and will turn on their own team at the drop of pin the show is pathetic these group should have died long ago ', ' really like this version of the punisher only thing that bugs me is the russo character the guy just doesn seem tough and is way to skinny to seem like marine that be imposing to the punisher more like speed freaky vibe ', ' this move is no like any other marvel movies direct to deep so here is my rating ', ' urgh by the second episode found myself skipping through to the end to see some of the action just can get on board with it it a bog standard origin story which we ve seen before mixed with teen high school drama the only thing that different about this is the diversity ll maybe persevere with one more episode if the action can be bothered to get going cringy ', ' from the first episode itself you know this is not just another marvel attempt to make tv show with stupid characters throwing some crap in the face of the audience just to fit in the ever expanding mcu universe that honour goes to agents of shield but exactly the opposite brilliantly written well made show with characters to care for with an intriguing plot to look for and the right amount of intensity and pace to keep you on the edge of your seats what else do we want it nothing like marvel has ever done before it dark yet fun to watch not like any other superhero where you kick someone butt and everything goes back to normal it relatable more closer and deeper what goes on in the life of saviour against the world of devils the cast is bang on charlie cox did very good job though vincent onofrio stole the show for me he was amazing the supporting cast was great and the character development was so well done that you might end up wanting to know more about them daredevil aka matt murdock lawyer by day and vigilante by night he is basically marvel version of batman without the wealth and gadgets which is what makes it look bit more realistic also the action sequence specially in second episode is fantastically done it the best thing marvel has ever done so far and one of the best shows out there don miss it ', ' marvel already has dark and crazy grim and despair down this is break from all that my sentiments on it are how felt about the hawkeye series it only been one episode but it was light had many funny moments and was building on backstory of culture that is not commonly shined on thought the humor was clever and the details we re inclusive m not muslim or pakistani but have co worker who is and feel like there is gateway to some awesome conversation there now how typical that is of pakistani parents yet it is also typical of many parents and how that experience alone can bring people together the show can be nuanced if you let it and m looking forward to the rest of the series beyond the introspective stuff really love the motion graphics and how they portray the imagination of youth the music selection was great as well give it shot and don take it and yourself so serious comics has spot for this kind of content as well ', ' oh my god cant even think straight right now if you can put adrenaline passion love sex and everything similar you can think of in blender puree it to hell and down dozen barrels of the concoction you might just end up with feeling similar to the one had after watching the avengers to say it is brilliant would be gross understatement it would be like saying the sun is warm or the universe is decently spacious the movie is miracle anyone who has even slight understanding of the marvel universe or has even seen the recent standalone pictures of thor captain america iron man and the hulk could fathom the insurmountableness of the task of putting them all together in one single two and half hour movie that like asking to fit the hulk in pepsi can can even begin imagining how one would even start with it but if anyone can do it it had to be joss whedon director know lot of people might be going to watch this movie just because of the lead characters but for me the pull was knowing mr whedon was at the helm for those of you haven heard his name think buffy the vampire slayer angel and firefly have loved all his previous works and expected decent product from him the trailers were bit unconvincing though must say but was stoked enough by the time entered the hall was the only guy there wearing an avengers shirt the movie had lot to live up for mainly decades of comic book lore and the expectations of generations of fans and am glad to say that it not only meets them but surpasses them in hulking leaps and bounds first up three words hulk hulk hulk the show stealer the show stopper the master of ceremonies the winner of the spotlight award the hulk yanks the movie all unto himself if loved the hulk before revere him now he smashes he busts heads he is everything you expect from superhero and more you have to see it to believe it his scenes will leave you screaming with joy and jumping from your seats whooping and dancing in the air hulk is the man and mark ruffalo world weary resigned bruce banner complements the severity of his alter form completely while the hulk is brutal banner finds repose in avoiding conflicts through wit when the green rage monster will break bones at the slightest insult bruce will take everything thrown at him with pinch of salt it the perfect duality and my favorite character of the whole ensemble seeing that the hulk has always been one of the most relatable superheroes of all time the very concept of losing yourself to anger is very humanly intrinsic characteristic and knowing this allows you to appreciate his awesomeness even more and yes yes have not forgotten scarlett johansenn black widow is there too and she kicks ass like never before she is stunning and beautiful and sexy and depending on your sexual preferences the second best thing in the movie the first still being the hulk her story opens up even more and so does her relationship to hawkeye brett renner who is also marvelous in his role too the most amazing thing in the movie perhaps is not the action of which there is tones but the amount of content that they have been able to cram into single film the character development is brilliant and even former fringe players like nick fury samuel jackson and agent coulson get more etched out here than in all their other movies put together all in all each character is better represented here than in their own movies iron man and thor might be the only exceptions the story itself is pretty simple one with loki tom hiddelston banished from aasgard at the end of thor drifts off into space returns with an alien army to take over the world and nick fury assembles the avengers to defend us but like they say the devil is in the details and so it is here this movie is riddled with amazing conversations and meticulously placed jokes most of them occurring in the midst of epic battles each characters relation with the other gets etched out during the course of the story and by the end what we have is comprehensive understanding of what the avengers are capable of and with major reveal at the end of the credits showing us the next villain you realize that this was in fact just two and half hour long prologue to what is yet to come god bless us all in short there is action there is humor there are heroes and there are villains wont spoil anything for you by describing any scene in length or short because the whole thing is that amazing this is ride everyone must take for the love of their inner child unlike the recent dark turn comic book movies have taken since nolan batman the avengers embraces its roots unabashedly think of all the cartoons you watched the comics you read and the toys with which you played out fantasy fights whedon has captured them all this is movie meant for pure joy and if you are even half as in love with any of the characters as am you will walk out with major pain in your face muscles from carrying ear to ear grin from title shot to credit roll ', ' movie is not too good not bad either one time watch that it think director doesn give much attention to widow and their focus on action scenes which are impressive but movie need strong storyline of black widows story is straight forward not much twist and drama ', ' it massive achievement for that movie to come with that skills of assassination the thing is jon wick was just the same but in women act are we talking about scarlett johansson the dream girl it certainly better than gal gadot scarlett johansson for sure she broke every move she made in that movie to one hell of work the valance was epic the fight was magnificent my idea scarlett johansson vs keanu reeves ohohhhhh man that would like to see on big screen the pretty and the dankness beast it horror movie but as say no wish can come true this my second review on this site and it will be the last 2 best assassins in the world god pls it wish won happen waw scarlett johansson the soul to my heart ', ' first off have to say find the character captain marvel not that exciting she mega powerful with no real growth there no vulnerability and she just not fun that said thought the original movie captain marvel had few good moments and enjoyed it ok here the big but really didn enjoy the marvels and didn feel it was movie that needed to be made in general feel the marvel movies have been coasting on past greatness for while thor love and thunder was horrible and left me hoping they never make another thor movie it sad to see beloved marvel characters reduced to sad unwatchable versions of their former selves even in the case of captain marvel she was reduced to comic relief good part of the time and don think brie larson has that comic ability to make it enjoyable don get me wrong think brie larson is stunning and is good actor just don see superhero movie as her platform for success ', ' captain marvel is fantastic addition to the marvel cinematic universe with the playful hat tips to future events and the always fantastic soundtrack it smashes into theatres and says m here to stay brie larson does brilliant and believable job as carol danvers and her interactions with both nick fury and maria rambeau is delightful and colourful there are some fantastic twists within the film which really set it apart this was the female lead superhero film we needed and captain marvel did not disappoint look forward to seeing her entrance into the mcu effects the landscape ', ' you would think looking at other select reviewers that they were writing about some factual documentary regarding other mcu shows being leaps and bounds ahead in terms of storytelling realism and production quality let be honest here we are all watching superheros didn really follow up to the release of this show and didn really know what to expect it was fresh fun take on formula that in my opinion has become little bland but still sells well at the box office if you are being put off starting this show based entirely on negative reviews my advice is just watch it and let yourself have some fun ', ' is what suppose the writers and the director thought when they came up with this movie people wondered why does such strong female character get her movie decade after the inception of the franchise and here the reason they never envisioned her as one when she needed to shine her spandex bottom to say quippy line or pose for group shot she was appreciated and remembered by youtube best of black widow compilations but when it comes to origin stories or what can character do on their own well only one thing was important that she was russian so the movie isn about her as character no it about her sister and her family and it not about her motivations or personality it about an evil ruski being an evil ruski and the problem is that ruski is probably the best character in the whole movie and what he does is basically what usa has done for the past 50 years so all the bad man is mad had no effect on me in fact merely appreciated the actor performance as well as pugh best rendition of jarjar binks the action is terrible editing is atrocious and unwatchable fighting is fake and animated it basically captain marvel that tries and fails because you don win game by scoring into your own gate the narrative and the pacing are barebone too because far too much time gets wasted on to put it simply idiotic comedy and what concerns character developed is mostly done by out of place action scenes or worse but did enjoy the red guardian character even if he was written with the all the misandry you could think of not as bad as the latest ghostbuters though and kind of appreciated the chemistry between characters again the humor it not tragedy or an action movie more like futurama episode and think black widow deserved better yes she is russian yes he had an origin story in her comics should divulge that the origin story of black panther characters would make modern lefties tear their hair out changes are often made to sell the propaganda and it seems like the respect for the character did not outweigh the necessity of her classic origin so no it not as bad as captain marvel it not something to shoot for like red sparrow it just bad movie one of the many 200mil well spent wonder woman 1984 tips her hat ', ' on how to ruin character so first of all the movie lacked the faithfulllness to the comic then there the choreography so bad very very bad and the real black widow is tough character violent one not family friendly character for me this is major letdown but unfortunatelly this is what happens when disney buys marvel or other superhero labels they completely destroy it ', ' matt character arc and development in this series and challanges he face was just on another level as viewer we gets connect with his struggles the action storyline scripta all was outstanding ', ' but then again anything with robert downey jr in it is simply awesome am also now interested in thor my title pretty much sums up what think of this movie will gladly watch another one if can find out if another one is being made or not m going to watch it again on netflix would like to know if this is the only one out there the avengers and if there is going to be another the avengers as well will watch that one too normally my genre of movies is paranormal syfy or stephen king related but this works for me as well will now look into action films as being my second favourite genre of movies and television ', ' few entertaining action scenes lots of tacky dialogue ', ' had to really force my self to finish the first season didn bother with the second ', ' this second season is giant leaps above the first season but still suffers from dull and uneven direction characters doing dumb things for no reason but to justify plot points and too many coincidences show the lazy writing on many an episode these mostly were supposed to be the best and brightest hand picked agents but often don act like it some of the characters and actors have good rapport but it more often than not squandered with bad dialog the writers have wealth of marvel lore to use but chose to drag out artifacts ala warehouse 13 and powered individuals of the week ala files the show needs better writing and stronger direction the action scenes are sometimes well done but are often too short suffering from the look of choreography from bad wire martial arts movie ', ' the first 3 episodes were pretty good then it gets way too much into family drama and east indian heritage and backstory it becomes more soap opera than superhero after episode 3 the focus is in the complete wrong area rather than being on this young woman gaining superpowers they shift the story completely to east indian political issues and history sure they throw in bit of cgi and minor action like 5 minutes to hopefully keep viewers engaged but really every episode tune out more fast forwarded through roughly 40 of episode 4 and at least 60 of episode 5 and it not like m anxiously awaiting episode 6 ', ' m not going to lie after the first trailer dropped was not impressed at all but after watching episode 1 ve got to say ve changed my mind its unique style and amazing acting performances had me hooked from the beginning and m actually very excited to see where it going know that this won be everybody cup of tea and that ok the comics have stuff for everybody not everybody will love it all but there always something for everyone and think that this is the way the mcu is going too the most important part here is however don hate it until you ve seen it ', ' always like comic based movies and this one did not disappoint much action which is why watch these movies there were plenty of hollywood retard thinking which wont mention so not to ruin the people that are not bother by it many funny moments and again lots of action would of also like if there had been full movies or some more back story on some of the characters but overall the movie was fun to watch great use of computer graphics and great sound track in addition the plot was not rich which think is acceptable in action movies definitely great movie for anyone that like action flicks ', ' stupid bad guys bad guy guns firing blanks or nerf dart laws of physics worse than really bad sf movie and plot holes you could drive an aircraft carrier through and just plain boring ', ' this movie put my expectations in shredder with lot of boredom and predictability was so bored that wanted to sleep never happens to me this was really disappointing ', ' this movie was keeping up to all my expectations and loved watching it keep watching it over and over it came way to late like many others said johansson deserved it way earlier but am happy that it is finally there this movie deserves much bettet rating the fight scenes are amazing and am absoultly in love with them most of the cretic is not deserved in my opinion would defently recommend it to ppl who dont know any marvel movies as well great job ', ' so my little brother age 8 likes marvel more then do something to do with superman being the worst thing ever but digress so was surprised when this popped up out of no disney xd we sat down and watched on the dvr got to say it was not bad my brother it was about someone young other than spider man saving the day me was just happy to squirrel girl not just pop up as some small part in spider man cartoon now to the downside could sit here and judge the movie on thick sg or say that it felt rushed at the end but the truth is it was not made for adults like me give it this 9 because of the smile it put on my brothers face as he watched them saved the day from the bad guys ', ' don know if my expectations were too high considering the movie got an extra year but this movie felt like rough draft wasn expecting much from this movie either was expecting mediocre plot with some fun action set pieces and few jokes sprinkled in between instead we got jumbled mess with boring plot and the titular character wasn even the star of the movie found red guardian yelena and the mother much better characters in this movie which was shocking considering scarlet has had over 10 years of experience playing the character yet she gave by far the worst performance in the whole movie now understand why marvel was hesitant to give black widow solo film she does not command the same screen presence as other characters such as rdj ironman or chris evan captain america if this is the quality of movie we get from here on out am very worried about the future of the mcu but am hopeful that this movie is just miss and not indicative of the future of the franchise ', ' pros florence pugh and david harbor did really good job and were easily the most entertaining parts of the movie the end credit scene was also pretty cool cons literally everything else the villain sucked scarlett johanson barely had anything to do the movie was just boring and it dragged on marvel was doing pretty good with loki so was very exited for this movie but they blew it ', ' felt the need to write this review since m kinda tired of reading reviews wrote by xenophobics and or misogynists think the low score for this show is because people hate the fact that the hero is brown woman like the character says in the show welcome to the xxi century women have equal rights genders should have equal rights other ethnics have equal rights the hate for this is because people can stand changes in the society leave the jurassic era please the show is nice yes sometimes is little bit cheesy sometimes you can feel some cringe but like other review said this is show for teenagers it only matter of perspective and making pact with the plot instead of resisting to what the story is telling us iman vellani does very good work she act so cute and naive gives the perfect image for the character of kamala in her beginnings also loved how they showed us some of the indian and pakistani culture it not perfect show it has some flaws but it not as bad as people with closed minds wants you to think ', ' really wanted to like jessica jones because have enjoyed all the other mcu shows on netflix daredevil the punisher being outstanding shows while luke cage iron fist the defenders were ok so gave it the benefit of doubt by painstakingly watching both seasons over many weeks as just could not not binge watch it no matter how hard tried to know feel like m having stockholm syndrome watching this show feeling sorry for how much of let down this show is and yet wanting to finish it because just wanted to find some sort of redeeming qualities to it let rate the show in terms of screenplay characters acting direction and production screenplay dialogues 1 10 was excited to read that this show had team of female writers directors and while can understand and sympathize with the themes laid out in the show as well as the desire to have female leads and supporting cast just couldn understand how this whole botched screenplay and horrendous dialogue came about it as though some spoiled milenial kids gathered together and told themselves let write the worst dialogues and action sequences possible and stretch it over the length of 13 episodes each season just so that we can tell ourselves how cool we are amongst ourselves audience be damned they will be cool if they like it and uncool if they don each season could have lasted just 3 to 5 episodes tops without the superfluous meaningless dialogues and dull moments where jessica jones drinks sits on chair or looks at her ceiling while talking her mindless drivel in the most monotonous tone possible with the most annoying pitch possible m not even referring to the many plot holes that this show has yes it a fantasy fiction but at least make it feel plausible here and there at some point you just don care anymore about how things connect with each other because you just want to know the end and that it fast forwarding the scenes that really get you nowhere but show whatever random thoughts the writers wanted to convey about jessica jones state of mind and her cliched insights on the meaning of life relationships and humanity the only redeeming characters are jessica mom alisa jones and jeri hogarth the ruthless yet human lawyer both characters showing some complexity and depth in their portrayal with refined layers the other characters jessica associate her love interest trish mom the cops are just pure caricatures with little to no emotional or intellectual depth and only serve as cheap pawns to the storyline for the most part it like watching soap opera in slow motion embedded in marvel comics action series really strange cocktail that going to give you headaches after trying to binge watch it over the course of weeks since it really impossible to wanna watch it like the other mcu shows it like waking up in jessica jones body and head after she gorges liters of bad whiskey so guess the creators of this show at least succeeded in that making us feel miserable watching miserable human being struggling with her superpowers it sort of the opposite of watching the punisher would say another story about human experiment gone wrong but this time done so powerfully well whereas the punisher feels like you can stop watching it with its gritty gutsy action packed sequences interspersed with believable emotional sequences and great dialogues jessica jones is this turtle paced poorly acted and directed show antithesis to the punisher whereas iron fist is at least entertaining with good looking cast despite its lead character being talentless boy jessica jones just doesn have any pacing that makes it enjoyable and entertaining what waste of money and people time overall this is as bad marvel comics show as can be as many have already reviewed so just wanted to add my rant to it because really can comprehend the 8 1 10 rating probably lot of good ratings stuffing from netflix user bots the lead actress was the worse casting decision she is simply terrible actress who doesn play the part well or she was just given such bad monologues that she just can get out of the mess that this show is the screenplay dialogues just make you feel like there really must be dearth in talent these days among the hollywood pool of writers who get these kind of jobs m sure there are many talented writers who for some reason can get the attention of the decision makers shame my advice only watch the show if you re curious about how multi million dollar series can be so poorly executed or if you re fan of cary ann moss trinity in the matrix series just fast forward to her sequences she is really good in jessica jones and finds lot more screen time than in the other mcu series on netflix ', ' regret spending my hard earned money to pay and stream this disappointing movie overhyped movie as usual of marvel acting was bad and bland cgi and cinematography was average plot was riddled with holes ending was mess ', ' did not think this would be good thought marvel was going down the pc checklist but it is so fun acting editing fx all outstanding it reminds me of spider man mcu for the level of tone its not the boys nor should it iman vellani is terrific can wait to see more ', ' think any men fan has at this point the timelines and characters are completely butchered how can rogue have existed in those terrible men films but captain marvel and ms marvel also exists within the same timeline why does this show exists and why does captain marvel exists so much is wrong with the mcu and tv mcu spinoffs it like marvel has oldtimers disease about their own comic book series and long time comic book fans are supposed to ignore the changes to plots that revolve around the comics stories they read growing up watching these shows really is like an alternate reality or something it not like rogue is some unkown men she is long time comic book favorite ms marvel and captain marvel are the unknowns nobody cares about ', ' marvel had the opportunity to create something awesome but failed so hard bland recap without any depth or aspiration with all the heroes and villians is this all we get every youtuber could create this while blindfolded this show is truly legendary but for all the wrong reasons ', ' only thing that would of made this better would of been daredevil cameo or some other crossover like season 2 of daredevil having kingpin punisher electra etc still punisher series was sweet blood and guts galore ', ' much needed representation imam has done great job embodying kamala the show shows the issues drama young kid would go through so it not fair to compare it with hawk eye or otherwise believe ms marvel would be great young avenger ', ' they spend money to make film you would enjoy you pay money to see movie and enjoy this is movie where every penny spend by the producers and the consumers is worth spend movies with so many superheroes are 90 of the time destined to be chaos yes there is chaos but its not the movie but in the heart of manhattan which is the battleground awesome dialogues rightly timed humor and incredible action you wouldn have time to chew your popcorn people who have come to imdb to check for reviews just don spend time here get ticket now watch it in 3d the movie is made for it ', ' this movie falls short in proper budget placement but its honestly not as horrible as was expecting not edge of your seat excitement like the past few years releases but didnt want to get up and walk out like did with thor lat sure there was some girly moments but it fell mostly on kamala character as she is teen fan and for me carrys the movie character building isnt there and like most all the villains lately darbenn lacks any sort of grit the cameo bring smile but the execution makes it hohum shortly after all in all go see it enjoy it for what it is have laugh and stay hopeful for the future of marvel ', ' apologize in advance for overruling the don review other reviews guideline but that is exactly my problem have read dozens of the reviews on these pages trying to get little thoughtful insight and they re all the same ooh this show isn exactly dreadful but our expectations are so high joss so high couldn you have just oh we dunno lived up to em just little chrissakes you people are disgusting stop watching this you have no business even trying to comprehend this show have read owned every single one of the comic books since the 1950 that were written to get toward getting these movies then this tv show made every one and am the biggest browncoat in the verse this side of nathan fillion or the whedon family and it just upsets me no end that all you miserable trolls even bother to watch this show or any of joss shows you re only watching it to have something else to whine about you re all the same people who turned up on fireflyfan com to gloat about how serenity was financial failure take hike go find something you can actually get behind and enjoy it for change and let the rest of us enjoy this show without your petty ignorant sniveling now have not only owned read every single one of these comics but have watched every single television show in history since annette funicello was mouseketeer and can authoritatively assure you that there has never been better television show in history than the agents none bar none not a law not the smothers brothers despite those beatles videos not my so called life not allie macbeal and for all us browncoats least those that were payin attention clearly this is the new firefly joss couldn resurrect firefly in way that fully carried on its spirit in direct fashion and so give the man little clout moolah and look it serenity takes off as the bus planet earth is the verse an coulson is cap tightpants sir not to mention the flying family of outsider misfits and even the occasional cowboy with shotgun all ya gotta do is get to the next job just need to keep flyin didja happen to notice ron glass to quote napoleon dynamite go osh but see how it works out missed firefly so much and lookit here am being handed neofirefly on silver platter love it it like joss jed took the lessons that got beaten into them with firefly serenity hooked up with mr stan lee and figured out how to do it even better man if any of you trolls can do better with your fine know it alledness why don you get your own miserable tv show and prove it put your money where your mouth is or to quote ginny weasley shut it and let the rest of us enjoy the whedonverse without your miserable stinky opinions clouding up our breathin air go osh dynamite ', ' never cared for black widow during all the other marvel movies she doesn have super powers and was just filler character the movie was nothing special and can believe character actually uses smell as defense against black widow like couldn she just back up little or something ', ' hope the fashion for women directors who make films about women will pass and faster because it goes badly and this is problem for the marvel universe let see what happens in the eternals which seems to me also failure with beautiful graphics and inappropriate jokes in short the film is bad that is not interesting stupid clich the heroes will always be on the defensive and are not in danger the fights are weak due to the quick frame changes almost had an epileptic seizure although am not an epileptic the villain is typical weinstein there is no music very lazy film as if neural network had invented it in recent years marvel studio has not even tried at first stupid endgame then captain marvel and now widow it a pity ', ' this was great and entertaining movie that focuses on family especially the sister relationship don buy into all the negativity go see it and judge for yourself have often found don agree with critics about movies especially random people and especially when the film is female lead ', ' worst movie of the avenger series story very weak action scenes far fetched ', ' cant help but feel disappointing and maybe bit cheated with this movie it feels like it was never really meant to succeed but rather be movie that connects to the next avengers the good 1 the are scenes where brie and slj are funny and have witty conversation 2 the chemistry between actors seemed to work really well 3 the graphics are really good the bad 1 liberal brainwash throughout the whole movie its relentless really 2 no development of character for anyone 3 the movie jumps from one thing to another often leaving you wondering what the hell just happened conclusion one of the worst marvell movies ever sorry stan ', ' too much cringe why mcu is investing into this garbage of show to the writers please stop stereotyping just stop couldn even through first 20 30 minutes of the 2nd episode m so done ', ' loved the first 4 seasons riveted then there was season 5 dark not good different writers maybe lost all the fun ', ' again that dream team made me completely wrong for lot of people think you expect something it gives you that path then suddenly it goes way more far it was tenacious but yet fragile movie to disappoint me in the story but the main memorable scene isn action or typical mcu moment but more intimate thing they took exactly the opposite of what would have done or expected of that movie instead of showing it characters centered to not spoil but yet guide you remember the famous scene of the youth of romanof when she get manipulated in age of ultron well this movie is more close to the dialogue between bruce banner and romanoff instead it makes you think instead of seeing things it the imagination used most of the time appart that beginning well it could have been that intro movie but it an amazing opening and it throws you quickly on the excitement of new adventure but with very familiar vibe if spider man far from home officially close the phases we know think in terms of release date this one is legitimately ends the mcu phases started in 2008 few long moment and sometimes out of the move but overall great mcu movie again and actors top notch fight scene are mindblowing and the effect teams did brilliant jobs ', ' have never been fan of the superhero daredevil but this show does the character justice in this series he not so much superhero as he is man trying to do the best he can the show is bit on the dark and violent side but is well produced and fun to watch ', ' must say to start loved the other two seasons of daredevil but my god that had to be the slowest most boring opener for new season ever fell asleep multiple times in the 25 mins disappointed to say the least ', ' very extraordinary film series teaches about etiquette good morals in the family friendship and an unpretentious person in the surrounding environment love ms marvel ', ' really intriguing marvel one shot interesting plot ', ' loved the first episode liked the second episode tolerated the third episode didn like the fourth episode didn even see the fifth episode it started out promising but as you can see with each episode gradually lost any interest had for this show will try to explain my reasons now ok actually it is only one reason actually the show suffers from the limitations presume disney marvel put on it for some reason this show has the same age restriction as game of thrones but it does not have more adult content than let say lucifer which creates certain dissonance that bugged me all the time apparently heavy swearing does not exist in the mcu so we are treated to main character who is written like john mcclane from die hard with vengeance but doesn utter single word really mcclane suffered from some sort of ptsd because of what he survived so did jessica mcclane drowned his sorrow in alcohol and sarcastic remarks so did jessica mcclane swore like drunk sailor jessica didn which normally wouldn bother me at all but it did help create the dissonance was talking about the same with the nudity apparently nudity also doesn exist in the mcu within the first three episodes we are treated to at least five different love making scenes showing various positions and techniques mean obviously the makers of the show were going for certain raunchiness but at the same time you never see jessica topless either she won take her bra off or she will be filmed from behind or the editing will be so choppy that you don see anything there are no exceptions the same with the violence now we ve seen daredevil and we know that extreme violence does exist within the mcu it doesn exist in jessica jones though and given certain parts of the main character life this is actually problem the fight choreography is just awful and whatever violence there is is completely bloodless don like that now don get me wrong don need or want swearing nudity or hard hitting violence in my tv but if you re not willing to actually put them in your show don write it in way that requires them it creates dissonance that at least to me is extremely off putting to put things in perspective had exactly the same problem caused by exactly the opposite circumstances with da vinci demons that show was written like an adventure oriented at 12 year olds but at the same time it was loaded with porn like nudity heavy swearing and extreme violence which again caused dissonance that made me stop following the show then there are other limitations undoubtedly coming from disney marvel why why did this thing have to be part of the mcu there was time when didn mind the idea of shared universe but here now we have tv ma rated show referring hulk and the agents of m s literally in other words to understand what you re seeing here in this adult oriented show you have to be familiar with show that only kid can enjoy well think don need to explain why this is problem to me then and am truly sorry for writing this there are the problems caused by the girl power angle don get me wrong love strong female characters but this is not the way to do them because if you make killgrave and luke women and jessica man you will not need to change even word from their dialogue apart from the pronouns seriously there was reason compared jessica to bruce willis character earlier she is bruce willis character only this time that character is played by woman when it comes to hogarth the situation is even worse it seems to me that the makers of the show had an lgbt quota to fill so well hogarth is harvey specter literally only this time he is married and for some reason looks like trinity from the matrix hogarth acts like harvey speaks like him and has the same character flaws that he has when started watching the show didn know hogarth was man in the source material but began suspecting this as soon as saw him her whatever as said love seeing strong female characters but this is not the way to make them see janet king and you will know what mean that is courthouse drama show centered around an lgbt woman it rocks seriously check it out none of the things mentioned above would be that big problem to me if it weren for the show overly serious tone seriously there is nothing to make you smile here there are some jokes but they are there only to show what cynic jessica jones is you will find more humour in christopher nolan movie to me this can only mean one thing the show makers thought they were making something deep and meaningful but jessica jones is not more deep or more meaningful than let say marvel iron man it is just less funny darker bleaker and slower it is not what it wants to be and as result just can continue watching it sorry ', ' love to finally see non white washed culturally accurate shows coming to the stage love the authenticity this show really represents disney coming of age in celebrating all cultures from the set designs to the colors and religious to cultural details they nailed it was so disappointed when aladdin live action movie came out that they did not opt to incorporate more authenticity to the film with real cultural dances and costumes this was the opposite hope disney continues down this path we should celebrate these differences and learn about each other to bring about better and more inclusive tomorrow am kamala khan myself 1st generation american pakistani but also puerto rican m not quite indian culturally nor feel fully puerto rican grew up half in out of three worlds indian pakistani puerto rican american thank you for this representation that so many of experienced first hand and for telling this diverse story am humbled ', ' florence pugh carried this movie her and david harbour laid down some seriously good comedic moments the action was as over the top as any other marvel movie so on brand there the acting was okay and cgi was expectedly good it felt like johansson took back seat to other characters which was disappointing ', ' modern and certainly to fault an attempt to draw in younger generation of watchers fast paced quippy and vapid enough for watchers seeking no more than brainless unimaginative contemporary fun it may get fleshed out eventually but why start out with strategy that bound to push away watchers seeking deeper more skillful storytelling it might be generational thing though but it was hard staying on this train for any length of time hopefully marvel go back to finding the balance between grounded relatable but extraordinary characters ', ' honestly found everything about this movie to be unlikeable the storyline was all over the place the fake accents were horrific as well ', ' really tried to give this show chance hoping something would pull me in unfortunately was disappointed and had to give up part way through the 2nd episode there were emojis flying across the screen and it was just too much of kids disney show for me really hoping don need to watch this for future marvel productions disappointed to say the least as you until now ve enjoyed all things marvel likeable ish character is the male sidekick but he doesn really bring much to the show apart from the obvious storyline that he likes the girl but complications stand in the way lead character was quite just annoying ', ' don usually trust the reviews but the bad ones are actually right the biggest problem with movie is captain herself there is no backstory or explained connection with other characters all the movie shows you is that she is op don want to write anymore about it because there is just too many things that are bad do you have to watch it before the end game don think so you will find little to none backstory about her that actually matters ', ' this movie was by no means life changing as people have said it was honestly lackluster film the only saving grace were the special effects the plot was all over the place the acting was treacherous and it seemed like the director wanted to turn this into some feminist propaganda movie only went to see it because want to be fully caught up when go to see the highly anticipated avengers endgame ', ' well that certainly was no thor 4 or antman 3 not even the type of issues that plagued wakanda forever it did have some less heinous issues but m surprised at the reactions m thinking it could be that ms marvel and wanda vision are required prerequisites also the background of the antagonist is left til halfway through whereas believe it really should be prologue also some cuts are tonally clashing and really undercuts the emotions there are plenty of lines that should be cut and some things which are foreshadowed that don come to fruition it not perfect by any means but did enjoy it for the most part and it doesn seem to suffer from the formula really do wonder what are the major issues some other people are having because just didn see the issues ve heard repeated by many different people ', ' ms marvel awasome show marvel constant always awesome and entertain evryone and all over india world wide movies and series want ms marvel movies please make movie and serise is my favourite listeted kamala khan ', ' another disappointed show by disney and marvel this is not even look like marvel tag on it should be on cn they put this show on ott without any script ', ' it sooo hard to watch know it tv pg but it just so cringe and wrong everything about this show is twisted it not even enjoyable forced myself to watch it because watched everything else and didn want to miss anything important that would connect to other shows or movies m honestly surprised how they let this one be released very disappointing hope they bounce back with thor 4 ', ' so it a kids show nothing wrong with that the moslem aspect is kind of goodness gracious me without the humour tend to disapprove of religious content but in this case it is not that intrusive minor laughs from slapstick but lacks real wit story is fine and watchable acting ok even if characters are bit 2d the mental graphics are very good but can become tiresome cgi average to poor all in all it is watchable ', ' not for the one second movie looked like mcu movie ', ' why 2 it kind of pirates of the caribbean nice fun disney movie but not serious story about professional killer sometimes boring as the plot is irrelevant not related to what one mind could ve imagined to be

marvel that what thought to see and that exactly what they told me seeing trailers and interviews and seen that the director was already involved in full features about the superheroes was ready to watch episode one and after seeing episode one this series looked great this wanted to follow until the pilot was done and we moved further into the real world of shield and from that moment things went totally wrong for me we moved 100 away from the superheroes and after 6 episodes was disgusted by the series from an excellent opening it turned into childish series that even looked fine for teenagers there nothing happening at all well there is the opening something happening and once the agents comes in it full of clich the boss coming up for his crew the sexy looking infiltrated chick the nerdie chick the freak the yawn macho man and zzzzzzzzz the effects used are rather good but admit after episode 6 closed the door nothing marvel ous here to see gore 0 5 nudity 0 5 effects 3 5 story 2 5 comedy 0 5 ', ' there so much wrong with this from the cast to the story so far don feel like explaining how much is wrong with this just don watch it it really bad ', ' don listen to the negativity make up your own mind was saddened to see the luke warm to negative reviews but then realised they are always there this movie is worthy of the mcu do wish it had been released years ago maybe after civil war yes but then it wouldn function as black widow swansong seeing more on the history of this character is long overdue florence pugh is outstanding in this film and johanssen is as good as ever ww84 wishes it could be as good as this ', ' sorry this does not deserve an average rating movie it is dull clich and predictable over action hyped overrated movie don waste your time ', ' m not actually sure why it didn keep my interest think mainly just never really cared about the characters the plot wasn any worse than some shows ve enjoyed and don think the acting was all that bad but pushed through most of the first season on pure willpower watched each episode because felt like should keep giving it chance not because really wanted to then one day realized hadn watched an episode in weeks and didn care m sure mister angry man goes on with his quest for revenge and kills lots of bad guys probably in clever and dramatic ways but think would have preferred if he had just died after couple of episodes then would have felt some relief that it was over and could move on to something else instead forced myself to keep watching for while then moved on to something else anyway meh ', ' foggy is the only piece in the entirety of the show that kept me interested matts character development is hard to watch karen don even know where to begin ', ' m showing my age here but m also coming from long history of loving marvel toons synthetic music with digital instruments gives me headaches it so much commercialized content that marvel rising secret warriors becomes perverbial shaking of the keys in front of baby face it flashy bright colors set to excess noise if this were japan you expect to read about the hundreds of cases of children going into seizures much like california theater warning for the incredibles 2 it was as uncomfortable to watch as shamwow commercial hey m yelling really loudly so you ll look up at the tv secondly just at glimpse couldn help but notice the body transformation of squirrel girl what was the point of giving her birthing hips the squirrel girl remember had tiny frame which gave her action scenes against bigger villains lop sided battle that you couldn help but cheer for her to win people tend to root for the underdog not the guy big enough to lift grown men off their feet it came across like she was the bully in at least one scenario there wasn much of story here it basically hero worship of older marvel characters and living up to be just like them it takes away from the individuality of the new characters origin stories saw this as one long movie edited from the shorts that wemade available maybe the idea was to get all of this information in small doses don know my experience was tiring didn finish watching because there wasn much there for me to care about no mystery no central element and all commercial ', ' oh oh oh what movie amazing direction and excellent graphics all the superheros this film are very awesome you will feel that have spent your money in useful entertainer film all the adventures are very cool in 3d it is very thundering iron man is awesome and he throws some good spills of comedies all the editing works are also very good you cant find any flaws in this movie enjoy this in 3d guys have cool day inside the theater never miss this film guys also come here and rate this movie have full satisfaction for seeing this film this is movie of lifetime have cool and chill day today good bye ', ' agents of h e d had rocky start considering it inception was the brain child of joss whedon and with backing of marvel off the back of the hugely successful avengers movie the show suffered from being in the shadow of the movie verse and over promised on something that it never had the ability to deliver which was story inter woven with the events of the movies could pick apart the show first season for hours talking about the trouble of episodic v in world that has moved on from that and the poor execution of and end of season twist with one of it characters most viewers tuned out after that and it a shame because the events the winter soldier was the best thing to happen to the show it allowed the show runners to break away from the movie and to do it own thing and this is where the show became interesting with greater focus on it own cast and telling their own stories this is show that season by season has taken some exciting twists and turns and broken out of the mould it own frame work aos has done unusual of starting bad and getting better each season it has matured well and would encourage anyone with an interest in good sci fi or hero esc stuff to give it another go ', ' cate shortland is rather unfamiliar to me when it comes to directors know and love however she has managed an admirable attempt at propelling the most significant female protagonist within the marvel universe still black widow scarlett johansson will not go it alone alongside her she gets yelena belova florence pugh who often outshines scarlett in this narrative due to the charismatic personality pugh brings firing on all cylinders from the get go the chemistry between the two is on par although pugh as yelena appears more tough and thick skinned possessing more believable agent in my opinion on top of this pugh brings humour when needed mocking the black widow for her dramatic postures in battle as well as pulling off russian accent pretty well maybe don find the black widow that interesting and m slightly harsh on scarlett here just felt florence pugh stole the show staged parents david harbour alexei poor excuse hoax of father as well as buffoon at times and assassin melina vostokoff work as russian undercover agents stealing intel from h e d escaping to cuba to meet with their boss general dreykov ray winstone the daughters natasha and yelena are left in dreykov hands to become black widows special agents of his to do his bidding this only creates resentment years later when natasha reunites with yelena to find out dreykov is still alive and controlling many more girls the same as they had been there are some good moments within the film from variety of actors and actresses although nothing memorable enough to cement this into my top ten comic book movies list david harbour becomes his own fantasy like super hero soldier the red guardian in what appears spoof of captain america rachel weisz melina stern in her approach as well as never quite sure where we stand with her she creates an unpredictable performance much to her merit in this type of film florence pugh manages to be versatile switching between stone faced tough agent to likeable down to earth well rounded grounded character scarlett black widow tends to play off the other characters well but can help feel that she needed to convey little more emotion considering her tragic traumatic upbringing ray winstone dreykov has very little screen time adding little to the plot and isn overly memorable as far villains are concerned it basically ray winstone playing ray winstone again often find the best superhero movies need good villain to be and success this falls well short of that mark all in all it could ve been better with more character development it isn the weakest marvel film ve seen still it is long way from the best ', ' was extremely disappointed with how they portrayed taskmaster it like the writers have never read comic book before and just saw pictures of him and someone said he mimics people and natasha chews gum with her mouth open 4 10 ', ' so marvel finally decided to bring all its superheroes together something that had been waiting for from long time until now there were only independent stories for each of the superheroes the avengers directed by joss whedon is the very first movie from marvel that unites all the heroes into one great action packed movie the movie brings iron man robert downey jr dr bruce banner aka hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans hawkeye jeremy renner and black widow scarlett johansson together to save the earth from the actions of the norse god loki tom hiddleston the story is similar to other superhero movies with the general save the earth from danger plot even though it may have simple plot however it does have some amazing action sequences and impressive special effects like the much more realistic hulk who through motion capture technology finally looks like the actor playing him the interaction between the superheroes as the movie progressed was also something to watch out for it had great performances by all the actors good humor and many others which will leave as mystery avengers is general sci fi superhero movie but it sets the stage for more eye catching sequels to follow according to me what whedon and marvel have created here is one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet this movie is must watch for the marvel fans out there would give it rating of 9 10 ', ' the mix of conspiracy family drama and fighting is pretty good very effective opening to find out the background of black widow and become one of the best in the mcu had missed the relationship between natasha and yelena at the beginning of their battle but surely the adult yelena character was easily recognizable the encounter of captain america characters natasha father and yelena in the russian version is enough to provide comedy spice for the villain it a bit disappointing too ordinary hoping it would have something to do with avenger infinity war it really doesn maybe there a sequel right ', ' the punisher season 1 went very strong with high action sequence and great punchlines from punisher overall the season was very much interesting with tense story lines like one thing most about punisher is that the action sequence are very realistic that makes the punisher even more interesting to watch after season 1 ended waited for season 2 and now it is out its awesome season 2 has more interesting punchlines like feelings are mutual jhon bertnel is on the ride again with his cool and natural acting there is more action and drama in season 2 the story is continuation from where the season 1 left it i really recommend each one of you that go and get yourself the sesaon 2 of punisher only if you have completed season 1 if you are looking for something dark and cool action show to get with it its pretty sure the punisher will help you out 10 stars to the show for me ', ' the show is good don get me wrong but if they didn introduce the punisher in the 2nd season giving way to his own series which think is by far the best netflix series out of them all it blows my mind we didn get season 3 of punisher while this show dragged on for 3 seasons while almost making you having to watch season 1 of the defenders to even watch season 3 my own opinion quit watching the daredevil halfway through season 3 ', ' this has to be the worst mcu show to date acting is horrible cultural appropriation to its peak its show not for adults but even my kids didnt want to see after few minutes bad cg doesnt seem like marvel project its as if they created this project to climb the inclusivity brand wagon terrible ', ' this series is so childish can say it hollywood shaka laka boom boom worst superhero worst vfx worst storytelling overall time waste plz marvel don spoil mcu ', ' earth mightiest heroes come together under one roof led in battle by the perfect soldier himself captain america to face the asgardian villain loki or as hulk put it pewny god first thing what happens when put bruce banner and thor in vessel way up in the sky and then banner sets hulk loose chaos like no other have to say watching this film will put you at the edge of your sit for the total 2hours 15mins sadly to say nick fury samuel jackson acting was the weakest among the group and mark ruffalo was the best but the hero to watch out for is the hulk this massive walking gamma radiation will make you laugh trip and then roll on the fall clutching your ribs you don believe me go get dose of the avengers this movie is cgi invasion almost everything at the final frontier final battle was cgi incorporated so well crafted was the cgi and so well mastered were the actors themselves that they flowed with the scenes with ease the comic relief in the movie were both the hulk banner and thor these were the high notes 1 when they took down an invading alien ship 2 when hulk and loki met face to face 3 when banner and thor discussed loki felt the comic relief was well crafted into the movie kudos to the script the screenplay and cinematography were also on point the screenplay was done by joss whedon who worked on buffy the vampire slayer he made every scene especially the fight and battle scenes so interesting sight the comedy action scenes were precise and will leave you gasping for breath as you never expect them even now that told you where they are still you won see it coming trust me directing in its part had to be done by master director because having all this heroes together you have to be able to mix and match so that none is underutilized and none is hugging the screen time nice work joss and watch out for cool camera angles one had captain america assessing scene and we get to see it from reflection again wonderful performance by tom hiddleston loki when he played loki in the 2011 thor he did it so well actually thought he knew the guy here too he did the same hope this won be the last we hear of him wasn so exciting was the iron man character although that is my point others may view it differently his humour always went over my head all through the movie black widow and hawk eye they held their own as they had no powers or special suit they made sure they had their share count of dead robotic bad guys captain played an important role in the end but the thing that was worth the watch in his character is the way he was oblivious about things thor was graceful as usual but the hulk was the icing on the cake all in all go see it ', ' the guy plays fisk us very untalented he must be the money man fir the show to be all over it he taljj oh like he is about to have heart attack and his fave looks like he just smelled rotten eggs ', ' like many people have struggled with marvel in post endgame world it seems to have had lot of stumbles in the movie department while the tv shows were consistently good the movies were inconsistent at best after thor 4 and doctor strange 2 really started to give up and enjoyable movies like guardians 3 seemed few and far between that being said for the first time since endgame finally have hope for future movies thanks to the marvels it was funny chaotic exciting and definitely felt like was back watching top tier marvel movies do you have to have seen the tv shows to understand it yes but this is marvel it not new thing that to enjoy some of the movies you have to have seen the stuff leading up to it that the whole point of the marvel cinematic universe it a whole universe packed full with characters and stories 10 10 really enjoyable movie ', ' it was ok not what was expecting for her story it still left lot unanswered would love to see real origin movie for this character as she is the best ', ' beautiful to look at featured some great tunes and used innovative ways of showing social networks and messaging great to see something covering locations and history we ve not seen before in disney or marvel and having muslim character ', ' m literally writing this review while trying for third time to make it through this series the plot is confusing and just could not hold my attention to the point was just assuming maybe this show is aimed towards younger viewers and that why think it boring but again think kids would have harder time trying to keep up and makes sense of this story line literally looked up reviews on this show while was watching it to see if was weird for not liking it to my surprise this is the highest rated show or movie in the marvel cinematic universe except on imdb m sure there are lot of negative reviews of this show by racist or haters but this bad review is from film enthusiast and marvel fan did like the actress playing kamala and the bruno kid or whatever his name is really wanted to like this show and the direction of marvel headed forward but geeeez d rather get 2 more seasons of iron fist than any more of this convoluted mess of show ', ' is not style would expect for superhero show but somehow it works kamala is an interesting character in the comics and wanna see what role she play in the mcu the casting is perfect the only bad thing is the power change ', ' disney seriously needs to hire christopher nolan to do the next marvel movie to bring their reputation back from the brink of permanent damage the character kamala khan is basically jar jar binks of the marvel universe if you are going to write script with kid in it then at don make her super cringe unrealistic emotionally and cheesy on top of that captain marvel was made out to be emotionally awkward for someone with extreme super powers compared to the first movie she is basically robot did she lose what it felt to be human after being in space alone for decades the editing and story continuity is all over the place as others have said ', ' great acting and incredible edge of your seat fight scenes many of us are still praying for 4th season ', ' this movie is great start of avengers serise it is better than 2 ', ' the whole narration should have been about how she became the black widow we know but ended up following storyline about where she went between civil war and infinity war ', ' this is good mood movie but somehow the timing isn right and it does not come up with new ideas maybe they should take more time to produce real quality scripts for the overcrowded marvel universe another super villain popping up and getting defeated another side character getting lost suns planets and dimensions in danger of being destroyed it seems they overdid it and at the moment there is nothing new to find still it mostly the weird timing which somehow makes everything happen too quickly and casually that makes this an average movie which is more disney plus catalogue addon than for the cinema ', ' tbh m not too excited about this movie in the first place my only reason is for understanding things before avengers endgame in case anything important comes from this movie watch at the cinema in the first day cause dont want to get spoiler after watch the movie omg this is so damn cool can describe in words it the only mcu movie that blow my mind with that plot twist good job anna ryan the three main aspect of great movie is story incredible visual fantastic character development amazing now am out of superlative word for it but seriously it so pretty damn cool movie the only flaws of this movie is the climax it not quite make my adrenaline goes crazy maybe because carol is too overpower that she can easily beat every enemy pretty much worth to watch ', ' it an ego trip for johansson as cgi does all the work and no acting required it a leg up in hollywood for pugh but really 134 minutes really don think so ', ' waited to do this review after seeing the film for the second time and am glad did understood it better and enjoyed it far more the film has an ok plot and plenty of action it is funny in places and builds well towards the end however some of the acting is quite poor some of the characters bit pointless and am not sure if adds lot to the marvel series sorry watch though if you like marvel ', ' don understand how they make these senseless time wasting and horrible movie star cast story direction and everything about this look fake and waste of time ', ' this movie was very average nice effects and sound expected more thor was good looking captain america is nice but what are his powers exactly ironman was nice better than ironman 3 which came out after this movie the actor who played the hulk is miss cast spiderman is missing in this movie in my opinion black widow is good looking loki is boring villain dc probably see this movie and can make it better with justice leauge ', ' this is by far the best marvel show ve watched and daredevil comes as close second it had all the elements of terrific tv show amazing cinematography stellar acting interesting backstory thrilling action and fantastic soundtracks playing throughout as said daredevil comes as close second because it was an amazing experience as well must say that the darkness and violence of the punisher kind of separates it from the rest of the pack yes jessica jones daredevil and others had lot of violence and darkness but the punisher is on another level found myself gasping in some scenes although jon bernthal frank castle was incredible in this believe that ben barnes billy russo absolutely stole the show this is must watch for marvel fans as well as dark thriller shows fans in general 10 10 ', ' lazy writing and poor production ruined what could have been worthwhile addition to the dd story ', ' ms marvel is rarity superhero show that cares about its characters and their development more than just putting them in endless action sequences by the end of the first episode was completely hooked and found myself actually caring about kamala khan and the odd turn her life was taking also find it amazing that the main character is unapologetically brown and muslim we have had so many white white white superheroes the writing is smart the dialogue is brisk and often funny the actors are 100 believable in largely unbelievable settings this is superhero tale for the current age and am here for it ', ' so watched the first three episodes and well was definitely hoping for something more the main character clark gregg phil coulson well he is the same plain simple character like in the movie thats what expect but brett dalton grant ward for me he doesn fit in for now we will see later on and what about those two kids odd crazy genius scientists it looks like they know everything about everything sometimes quite annoying melinda may what can say its just jet li jackie chan in 50 years old woman suit and conversation between characters sometimes out of lines odd and trying to be funny failed still will keep watching it and hope for some small improvements ', ' trash too bad of plot characters are all over the place no clear objective ', ' perfect black widow the action in this movie os incredible scaet is impecable ', ' cgi and makeup are absolute garbage fighting scenes are disaster can barely move guy without special effects also jumps with him 50 meters high gets hit in the left side her liver hurts jumps off building her dress doesn move an inch as if it were static bomb exploding on the sidewalk the car parked next to it explodes from the inside in mushroom and the person closest to the bomb is the only one who survives you need to get the blue pill to get better 3 minutes later oh my god what di we do call an ambulance how about going to get the fking blue pill gets someone head out of river after 5 minutes head looks like it been underwater for 2 weeks gets 30 cuts with 7 3 inches knife gets few scratches that do not bleed ', ' not typical teen movie fun with twists good acting and characters and now they insist on 150 characters seriously okay so will also comment on the effects nice work guys also liked the view into culture had very little knowledge about tapping fingers when is the next season ', ' heard somewhere this was the first great marvel flick or this was the one to watch first or something like that overall it was entertaining but nothing special the characters and story are pretty cliched some powerful object tesseract falls into the hands of malicious superhero loki well played by tom hiddleston and crew comes together to try to get it back from him before he can pass it to the evil aliens who want to destroy earth they try to liven things up by creating some character and conflicts and the like but for the most part it is snooze downey iron man is ironic and witty thor turns out to be the estranged brother of loki yeah yeah these kinds of flicks are plug and play get some star actors and plug them in and so long as they look the part things work out it is fun to watch them flying around midtown manhattan and smashing things up the effects are the real stars it is interesting to note that like our ancestors from previous centuries the modern world wants to have its myths and its heroes guess old habits tend to stick around but these myths mean very little and serve mostly to keep people eyes glued to screen ', ' grew up with the punisher comics still have quite few of them sitting in footlocker at my parent house love the character love the gritty anti hero with nothing but revenge fueling his motives it a great series to pick up and run with if it done right the issue was the only other time punisher has seen some decent screen time was back in 2004 with thomas jane in the role this series trumps that absolutely jon is the perfect cast for the role does it justice gives you the sense of what frank is feeling and holds no bars back as he lays into his enemies the series gets slow ish start winding up to the full punisher mantle and really hated that the only villain we honestly got was billy russo he ok as an antagonist but didn need to see him for both seasons frank castle literally interacts with almost every marvel character and group at some point and time and even crossed over to fight batman at one point but you make single villain hold both seasons with small one off bad guys to hold the gaps down know netflix was trying to play the slow game here and wind up to the bigger and badder boys but this felt lazy and like move to save on character acquisition still great series but if mcu does bring back jon and the gang maybe leave russo out for bit ', ' when my teen son who is everything marvel super fan thinks it bad you guys have missed even your intended target audience what missed opportunity to produce something different m feeling sorry for the actors they tried it not their fault believe the end of the marvel verse is getting closer fast ', ' the way the director have conveyed each scene is just amazing the screenplay performance of all the cast locations are perfect throughout choreography displays the best realistic fight that anybody would have ever seen in any movies or series the way the story is conveyed is brilliant after finished watching season 2 the worst feeling is to wait for another year for season 3 way to go team daredevil the end of the season 2 has triggered lot of curiosity yet another great work by marvel although the wait for 1 year is worth it it would be great to watch it often thank you for giving such great series ', ' great tv show with the best actor for this role jon bernthal thanks to the actor this series makes everything so real even though its based in marvel comics ', ' after 2 episodes still cant get whats going on the jumps in the editing make the story arc very jagged over all think this poor rushed show thats not upto the marvel standerd ', ' actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters originally was just going to wait for its home release on disney plus but after recently rewatching wandavision genuinely wanted to see how they would handle monica rambeau and see what they would do with her so ll mention the positives for this film first the movie is actually pretty really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good this is very surprising to say as recent marvel projects are tremendous eye sores the films central characters captain marvel brie larson monica rambeau teyonah parris and kamala khan iman vellani were surprisingly good had fully anticipated to dislike captain marvel and ms marvel in this film but surprisingly enjoyed them both which is big compliment coming from me and monica rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as expected and anticipated all three actresses gave enjoyable performances and they all worked well together on screen then of course samuel jackson is always great and the return of everyone favorite flerken kitty goose she had great sequence that refuse to spoil but it had me dying goose saved this film and well that it this film is just bad bad writing bad pacing bad storytelling nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time which is quite frankly fine for me as genuinely did not want more of this this movie as whole is just overwhelmingly safe it has no stakes takes no risks and does nothing but there is actual enjoyment in its failings it was so bad that it was good the amount of eye rolling face palms and sighs gave through this film was astonishing gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes and afterward that when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be then suddenly out of nowhere the film became musical like what is happening this film is so chaotic and unstructured it just never stopped the film had good mid credit scene so you know stay for that unfortunately it was spoiled for me so it didn hit as hard as it could have especially if you re fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces but the marvels was exactly what anticipated it to be below average dump which is shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film but they do nothing with them or they are just poorly handled can at least say didn hate this movie unfortunately just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons imdb 3 10 letterboxd 2 5 watched in theaters ', ' the marvels 2023 found it really hard to concentrate on this film because it was just so bad and the story so boring it really felt like repeat of something that d seen before and childish attempt to achieve it more akin to percy jackson 2010 2013 and harry potter 1 2 2001 2002 than the rest of the entire marvel cinematic universe actually liked the tv series of ms marvel 2022 which worked fine as quirky serial about an unconventional young superhero living as part of an indian family and the restrictions that she felt that implied but the treatment of that didn translate to the big screen and this might have been better at least without her family their silliness didn need to come along for the ride it may also sound bad but it got very girly because of the attempt to fit ms marvel iman vellani in and more than bit goofy too at one point it was like they were gossiping at sleepover that wasn the only thing that was childish though the singing planet was like something from very lame original star trek 1966 9 or deep space nine 1993 9 episode and mean no disrespect to trek because that series could get away with those things in their way of exploring how other species might differ and to show acceptance tolerance to those that are different also because it was only 45 minutes at time but in this film it just felt as if it was done for comedic effect in an attempt to match taika waititi comedic style with thor ragnarok 2017 and the cat thing was too much as well must confess that do moan when they make these films overly complicated with twists and turns that have me second guessing everything and everyone like secret invasion 2023 but this was so simplistic that it was just not worth making and really didn seem to expand the marvel storyline at all most people had agreed that captain marvel hadn been success in her first film so it was surprise that this one was made can say if that was brie larsons fault the characters the script or whatever but it was as if they had almost admitted defeat with this release just to fulfill contract or something the story went that captain marvel actions following the last film and her disposal of the supreme intelligence on hala the kree homeworld had rendered the planet with unbreathable air etc and so dar benn zawe ashton was hell bent on revenge targeting the captain favourite planets to restore the balance instead of any of them just sitting down for five seconds to work out what could be done otherwise which was basically the cop out ending it all felt lot like guardians of the galaxy 2014 and the previous captain marvel 2019 nothing new at all for the franchise as whole and especially the smaller space based episodes and felt if it didn add anything new why bother might have preferred film centred on monica rambeau teyonah parris alone actually giving her the chance to take over in the role of the captain and perhaps that where this will lead but even then the actor didn seem quite right in the role despite being much more interesting than brie c it was such an obviously rushed film the pacing was ridiculous as if they had expected people to get bored and turn it off if it had been longer running time the teleportation concept at the very beginning was really annoying too and lasted too long before its resolution captain marvel was not as serious as she had been in the last one so it was almost as if they had rebooted her and am becoming more and more convinced that it is time for samuel jackson to step away from the role of nick fury there nothing surprising about him anymore and the role is tired as for other faults wondered how one kree woman was stronger than three marvels all together they should have defeated her easily and how could ms marvel use her power without her bangle hoped that the khan family had superhero damage as part of their home insurance policy too flerken vomit 443 45 1000 ', ' after iron fist and defenders had almost given up on marvel series but this this is finally good show again more like this gritty bloody conspiracy and lots of social criticism us veterans don have it easy it is shame that the us is one of the most positive countries towards soldiers and war in general but when they got problems they get little help lots of action good story and makes you think ', ' good old fashioned i screen full review viewed twice by me over the course of of july yelena belova to natasha rommanoff the black widow and said in jest you re such poser 1 absolutely positively loved it and m going to say that right off the bat for what it worth actually had to go see black widow bw for short twice as wasn able to catch the beginning the first time ended up appreciating it so much more on the re watch because this time around the superb intricate and often super hilarious drama between the lead characters really hit home for me so much so that inasmuch as was concerned atleast just about the only existing flaw with this film for me if any was the altogether glaring fact that it is now all but certain that we won be seeing scarlett johansson sj for short reprise her fascinatingly complex and truly glorious role as the globally revered superheroine not only has this prequel movie narrative place in the overall mcu marvel cinematic universe massive integrated storyline always been made crystal clear by marvel studios from the very get go but sj herself has now very publicly come out all but unequivocally confirmed that she will not be returning as the black widow period invite you in earnest especially if you re somewhat new to the whole mcu thing to view the first 1 minute of one particular official trailer by them the one still entitled new trailer youtube apr 03 2021 where the rationale if you will for bw is explained um super well and is narrated by none other than you guessed it the hopelessly vivacious and yes genuinely affable miz johansson herself 2 loose ends are tied nicely here a small but undeniably significant example the aforementioned miz johansson seemingly random generally inexplicable suddenly blonde hair in infinity war look that frankly could never quite fully appreciate or even simply understand at the time having over the course of all her first five major starring role films as the bw come to entirely adore the trademark fiery red tresses look that she would inevitably be seen sporting was finally explained to us and looking to the bigger things the picture essentially filled in whole bunch of gaps and story holes that would often totally have me headscratching for answers in the often frustratingly long spells between each successive new marvel release this is achieved through wide array of intricately intertwined and previously unknown backstories not to mention giving us satisfyingly thorough insight into the reasons behind the smattering of badly damaged relationships left in the bw wake that occurred well before indeed leading up to her very very high priced and hard won formal entry into the super secretive shield organization and concomitant defection from the russian secret service the fsb formerly known as the kgb hence big loud kudos to the wonderfully gifted miz jac schaeffer and ned benson the story writers as well as eric pearson the movie screenwriter 3 veritable explosion of talent huge hearty pat on the back is completely in order for cate shortland the australian directress of this usd 200 million cinematic powder keg although she may have been hitherto relatively unknown to many this tremendously accomplished native of temora new south wales actually has get this two full decades of both tv as well as film direction credits under her belt with 2012 war romance drama lore being her highest earning movie to date until black widow of course that is to say not only has she very successfully managed to bring together tremendously cohesive principal cast just gushing with absolutely stellar talent let be clear quick special mention of note altogether warranted here for the charmingly bubbly ever tenacious newcomer to marvel florence pugh who well truly excels in her portrayal of yelena belova but the film crew that she assembled have also well truly outdone themseves in every single aspect of the production the dazzlingly mega stylistic impressive fight choreography employed in the widows training scene trailers also featuring an fsb mini battalion of spectacularly luminescent black red clad elite girl assassins is probably among the few that really really stood out for me visually in the film and last but most definitely not least quick special mention of the fact that the 5 individual russian accents performed by 5 of most important principal actors each to its very specific varying degree were pulled off rather immaculately might add by 5 different actors from well get this the uk the usa summation just as long as you go and see black widow with free and open mind prepared to be well and truly entertained in my specific case the very obvious anachronistic aspect of said movie did in fact make the prospect of watching it in the days leading up to bw release feel tad strange if you will however just as soon as was actually in my seat the protracted fabulous even bond esque intro sequence had already surreptitiously begun to work its insta magic on me and then but of course when that ever familiar ever dramatic and yes ever beloved marvel theme eventually roared through the massive cinema hall was in it all just seemed to at once snap into place an unabashed explosive 13 00 marks out of 10 00 marks from me oh and yes scarlett johansson you will be sorely but surely dearly missed as the black widow wow whopping nine pictures 8 major leading roles 1 post credits scene later what spectacularly memorable journey it been ', ' it had great start but with every episode was losing my interest on it mostly because of the inconsistent argument lack of logic and plot holes not as good as it is said jessica jones is well performed but those secondary characters were simply annoying the cop and the blondie had lot of time on the screen that their acting doesn deserve the lesbian womans also did not contribute in making the plot more deep just semi filler characters not recommended at all ', ' don know just something was off m watching all the marvel movies in order on disney for the first time and got to this movie and it just was off was excited to watch it for the first time and wanted it to be good because really like how scarlett johansson has been throughout this whole series and she finally got her solo movie but it just did nothing for me compared to the other movies ', ' but it is the little stuff that is bugging me obvious product placement still confused about what part of dhs dinah madani belongs too swear when she produced id her badge said ice but she seems and acts like fbi which is not part of dhs the actress playing madani is very good and very beautiful which only mention because after surviving brutal car wreck she has two straight nights of sex and thank god her lovely body shows no signs of trauma though there was the obligatory wince of pain maybe pleasure the first night the killer missed detail was the large us flag hanging on the wall of the barracks at the afghan fob no mater how the us flag is hung blue field should be positioned left to right the flag was backwards on military base we shall see what comes maybe my rating will improve btw did like the skip intro button at the start of each episode ', ' the marvels is movie that tries to be superhero blockbuster but fails to deliver on its promise the story is weak and predictable the effects are mediocre and the acting is decent at best the actors seem to do their best with what they are given but they are hampered by the poor direction and vision of the filmmakers the movie does not have clear identity or purpose and it feels like mishmash of different genres and tones the movie does not explore the potential of its characters or their relationships and it wastes the opportunity to create meaningful and engaging story the movie is not disaster but it is not marvel either it is bland and forgettable film that does not live up to the expectations of the fans or the critics the marvels is movie that you can skip without missing anything ', ' this is just regular action movie nothing more wondering why did marvel film this movie it wasn necessary to watch ', ' this is surprisingly very good show if you can handle the blood it really impressive what they ve done with super obscure marvel character highly recommend to anyone who likes deadpool it definitely that style of comedy action ', ' feel like ve lost some friends after watching the last episode this series is gem yes some seasons and episodes are better than others but overall magnificent piece of television feel that ve bonded with phil daisy mack fitz gemma yo yo and the wonder that is may plus many more great characters over the years thanks for 7 great seasons and remember if anyone asks who the greatest marvel superhero of them all is the answer is easy agent phil coulsdon ', ' worst movie have seen in years my husband gave up 20 minutes in but stayed to the end wish id left with my husband the cat has more acting range than brie larson they ruined nick fury can honestly say won be watching this again so disappointed as love the mcu really hope she isn in endgame that much don want that ruined too agree with the russo brothers that she shouldn be in it at all character needs recast and better writing m not dc fan but wonder woman was more superior movie in every way don need captain marvel for female role model in super hero movies already have black widow scarlet witch shuri gamora okoye nakia and even nebula all strong women who are strong because of their nature not because all men are evil and beat women down as mother daughter wife sister aunty and granddaughter find the message of this movie highly offensive very very disappointed you don need to see this movie before seeing endgame watch infinity war again ', ' for real not the moment not important not necessary my time was more important what have done lol ', ' finally black widow scarlett johansson gets story that is dedicated entirely to her and the one that takes us back to her childhood and the make believe world that she called family and she is not alone her younger sister yelena belova florence pugh black widow herself is still with the red room but now she wants out and it her elder sister to the rescue in their quest to destroy common enemy they end up with their faux parents alexei shostakov david harbour and melina vostokoff rachel weisz this family reunion is marked by double crosses and an inevitable danger that could be the end of the road for romanoff director cate shortland goes for the human story behind black widow past and present and drives it well with all the action peppered throughout this is the reason why the film high tech and complex narrative feels relatable amidst all the mumbo jumbo about the mind controlling gadgetry and elite technology capable of bringing in the new world order what really hits home is the simple connection between the two sisters and the longing they feel for family that never was while scarlett johansson plays her part with seasoned finesse giving us protagonist that is always easy to root for florence pugh is extremely adorable pugh is perfect fit as slightly brash and spoilt younger sister who despite all the elite training to become black widow retains her child like innocence and charm she also brings in plenty of sass and comedy delivering effective punches both comical and actual david harbour is bit of drag thanks to his annoying character loose cannon you know will spell trouble much unlike his onscreen partner rachel weisz who is classy and understated as the unpredictable melina vostokoff but collectively it their chemistry and the performances that work action wise there is enough to hold genre fans and mcu followers and most of the chase scenes are edge of the seat the action is slick and comes at opportune times and all of this in film led by women is even more commendable although the special effects at times don match up to the standards we expect from this affluent franchise overall black widow justifies its place in the mcu with an entertaining story that has drama action and comedy making it hollywood potboiler worth your time all the way to the post end credits scene that cannot be missed ', ' ok so it a 6 1 lots of 1s and lots of 10s thing is it not good series and there are lots of written reviews that give this 1 the 10a nothing so studio bots seems like lot of fake 10s cause this series does not deserve that ', ' more fodder for the masses all fight scenes seem to be taken from the bourne movies nothing original one could care less if any of the protagonists survived till the end totally forgettable movie ', ' the build up from season 1 to 3 wow one of the best series so far ', ' no deeper storyline or audience experience here it all about the special effects the characters are extremely fake and over the top no authenticity and they even had musical parts included thought it couldn get worse after the last antman and wasp but there we go it got worse it also female hero villian dominated movie so the diversity criteria weren met for me no deeper plot twist or emotion created the creators were aware of that that why there was scene were captain marvel got confronted about leaving earth but there was no real pain or whatsoever behind it rolled my eyes and just thought get tf over it how could you be so shallow legitly got my time wasted also walked out not recommending the movie and compared to the rest of marvel movies it straight up trash ', ' saw the movie couple of hours ago it was was little bit hard to follow the story early on once it got going it made sense and the story behind carol danvers was great it didn feel like marvel movie as the others imo but after endgame it will be changing of the guard anyways go see it ', ' come back every week to get load of chloe bennet the show itself is total miss for me from episode 1 in fact everything this show had to say in terms of main plot was in episode 1 now it is just recycling itself it reminds me of the alcatraz flop that way another parallel to alcatraz is that do not really care about main characters their issues and chemistries the underlying problem with this show is that the setting is in post alien war of the avengers the extras the rest of humanity that is went back to living their ordinary pre war lives like the world did not change at all clark gregg character is becoming annoying he comes across like softie with tough job ming na wen character is the flattest most naive and most lifeless character ve seen in tv show or movie the two geeks are isolated from reality human nature and the plot itself to such extent that they probably would not even notice if you kept them under glass bell the whole time the are supposed to be incredibly smart but the insistence on their geekiness is so overblown that their level of sentience appears equal that of lab rats could go on and start to rant but it really boils down to chloe for me sorry ', ' the storyline is predictive and is just one knockoff after another not true adaptation of the comics but it is good for occupying couple hours out of your timeline the main characters are forced and it seemed to push slight bit the disney narrative and spent too much time trying to tell social justice story instead of super hero story the acting was decent for mainly being younger adults and kids the special effects were decent but the superhero part of the story was lacking in ability and depth and the so called bad guys were predictable and boring not really one surprise in the entire series ', ' not your typical superheroes team up movie this movie comes with lot more and it sure does carry alot more weight than the title the marvel cinematic universe lead to this moment the team that has been assembled are sure to get the job done in this film we see the likes of thor the god of thunder iron man tech genius billionaire hulk the scoentist turned green monster caltain america usa saviour hawkeye the lord of the arrow black widow russian spy turned avenger which are all bound to bring some baggage with them of sorts the god of mischief being thors brother as the billian of the movie isa great one and now he has show called loki coming out highly recommend watching this and the 6 movies that lead up to it or just watch the whole mcu ', ' starting from season 1 it gives a kind of different impression then the other super hero shows blind man fights for crime with and without mask is itself convincing plot for viewers unlike other heros killing criminals is not thing of daredevil ratherthen believes changing their life to better path or letting police to handle further this idealism of his sometimes becomes frustrating to viewer but the way things flip at end of each season makes it more worthy as mostly 1st season is best 2nd kind of good and 3rd quite awesome show is full of logic peoples idealism and justice one thing should know is after 2nd season continuation goes to the defenders after it is the third season some of might not have clear view to weather watch or not because show got cancelled but 3 season are enough to show it supremesy ', ' had high hopes for this show but something just wasn right finally put my finger on it tonight after watching on my pvr the editing camera work direction is sad and frustrating the camera angle is constantly changing average around 4 seconds per angle which think is ploy to keep people interested excited but it just makes the show hard to watch too much add not enough focus which makes the show feel cheap and can we please pan out bit does every scene need to be close up would help the show if you could see more of the environment overall could put up with the mediocre storyline if the camera work editing were better executed disappointing not the worst show ve seen but definitely one my husband will be watching without me ', ' firstly the movie very boring brie is probably now one of my dislikes actresses and if see her name on movie won be watching it she cannot act no facial expressions no variations in tone essentially no acting she like robot the cat was funny fury was great and the rest of it was just terrible looking at the box office returns people might say well it did great at the box office so it must have been great the fact is lots of people went to see it only because it was mcu movie and have grown to expect high quality entertaining experience every time with mcu call it safe bet for fun time until now that is lots of previous marvel fans will be thinking twice about just automatically going to see mcu movie in the future thanks to how terrible this one was don waste your hard earned on this at the cinema wait for it to hit netflix or just don even bother and wait for endgame ', ' everyone reviews this as the typical mcu season that needs to continue story somewhat somewhere but what this season was about is kamala khan the introduction to ms marvel even tho the introduction has been really typical thing for every super hero m glad they atleast let us have hype bit excited about every aspect otherwise we would think of this as another superhero intro and bam the same thing but love how they represented it for starters and to line up for the marvels this is just the start ly kk ', ' the film that scarlett johansson natasha romanoff deserves scarlett florence pugh are utterly outstanding cate shortland has made truly beautiful film ', ' when heard about agents of shield was excited even more so when realized that they were bringing back one of my favorite mcu characters phil coulson back the show did have slow start after the events of captain america the winter soldier the show really starts to show its potential lot of shows like buffy and dollhouse start off slow in the first season the story lines and characters in agents of shield really start to shine after the big reveal in captain america 2 the show does reference the events of the avengers and the solo adventures of each avenger character like mentions of extremis from iron man 3 the events of thor the dark world and so on agents of shield brings in characters who are both old and new to the mcu some examples are nick fury maria hill deathlok blizzard and mockingbird along with peggy carter it great that the show is bringing villains from the comics that were never used in the movies agents of shield is definitely worth the watch can wait to add season 2 to my movie collection ', ' very bad movie please don watch it doesn deserve the cinema ticket value ', ' this tv show is strange and feels very cheap but let me start with positives found the way this show is directed and edited is amazing and it feels very artistic and its something really enjoyed about the show in sense its refreshing to see this new type of directing and editing in marvel tv show another positive is that its interesting to see pakistani superhero finally something new in term of culture and history really enjoyed seeing it but many pakistani people say that the way their culture is being presented is not very accurate which is something can confirm or deny cuz m not from pakistan but if people feel their culture is not being accuratly represented we need to point it out as far as positives go it all got don want to be overly critical but this show is really boring nothing is going on there if you finally see some action it just feels cheap its feeling that will stay with you the whole tv show heard one guy in review said that if he was teen he would have enjoyed the show more and think he right and thats the whole problem with this show its cheap and teeny really looked foward to this show because liked the avengers game kamala khan version she was fun and was adding freshes to the universe she was in and feel like this show is exactly the opposite just another teen character and its shame this had huge potential but its wasted wouldn personally recommend it but everybody got their taste so maybe you like it ', ' marvel should have made tv series of black widow like wandavision not movie like this ', ' it was fun to watch easy to watch actually had to stop doing what was doing to pay attention to the movie it was funny heartfelt and fun to watch wasn watching to be in lighten or moved or eat pre love whatever it was so fun movie just try to enjoy and stop over analyzing things not everything has to be the movie enjoy the characters enjoy the backstory even seeing other planets love the action and the training and exploring the powers was fun to watch it wasn overdone it actually showed lot of good character building enjoyed the family aspects of the movie the young miss marvel was fun to watch and to see the other marvel show off their powers ', ' m levi from netherland next to germany and this movie is also showed in my country and liked it so much that also because am huge fan of marvel movies but this one was until now the best marvel movie my favourite avenger is iron man robert downey jr because he is funny and just great now have seen that there will be sequel and there where questions who will die d say iron man because we saw in iron man 3 he don need that glowing subject don know how its called anymore so there will be going lot of wrong with jarvis but d might be wrong but this movie deserves 9 ', ' although marked 10 10 purely was reacting to the chemistry between natasha and yelena which really enjoyed and thought brought some realism humanity to marvel universe that relies on endless action scenes that often blur together for marvel movie felt actually connected with the characters and felt sad knowing this would be the only content we would be getting this movie has plenty of issues and plot holes but was still enjoyable and brought me plenty of laughs lastly see plenty of reviews critiquing the fact natasha took back seat to yelena and totally agree with those views do think however that it was intentionally done by marvel to create an easy way to introduce yelena and gain larger following for the character which more marvels bottom line like any major film studio would have liked to delve more into the character of black widow but that wishful thinking guess ', ' 8 8 out of 10 are you smegging kidding me this is one of the worst tv series ve ever watched what makes it so bad and unbearable you might ask pointless fistfights alternate with pointless dialog and they drag on for hours and hours seriously thought the obsession with fistfights went out with the first star trek series and was convinced with the latest ventures of batman iron man jessica jones to name just few the super hero genre had been redefined to some degree you know put some humour and self irony into it something you won find in dare devil no matter how hard you look also from very early on wondered why is he blind like he doesn seem to have any restrictions from his blindness so there is no point for him to be blind in the first place sure his hearing has been enhanced so they go for the compulsory heartbeat in every smegging episode but otherwise fail to explain how exactly daredevil compensates for his lost eyesight ', ' black widow was pretty impressive and surprisingly well paced for what it was worth the story was little too late for its own good to come to fruition but it was awesome being able to see black widow earn her own solo film scarlett johansson played her wonderfully and shown emotional leverage to the character florence pugh was also just as good if not better in some parts of this film she a rising star especially coming from midsommar directed by ari aster believe she has much more talent to show to the world overtime the rest of the film itself is good it fun and it well done as most marvel movies are the villain was awesome and is unquestionably one of the most badass villains to come to the mcu my only complaints are some of the decisions on timing of the story and where it takes place it pretty incoherent and almost at some point seems to feel convoluted in terms of matching up with the mcu timeline but think they made do with what they could and it doesn affect it dramatically in the long run the cgi is also lot less stellar which is insane comparing this to endgame use of cgi in this movie which is strange due to the budgeting and income these marvel films make you will notice poor cgi in some scenes but the choreography and set pieces are super epic all in all d recommend black widow for marvel fans and those that wanted to see their heroine finally get her own screen time it a fun solid watch it just has some chips along the way ', ' the cancel culture against cancel culture is evident in marvel movies believe some of the audience has outgrown them although not perfect it a fun family action adventure deep no fun absolutely the weak point is the villain she has background story that could be more deeply explored the marvel universe has become so vast that it feels like you need to watch countless other things to understand one movie however if you re looking for cool action packed and funny movie this one is great its simplicity in storytelling coupled with the high stakes action typical of marvel makes it worthwhile watch for fans and newcomers alike ', ' whosever idea it was to have the musical aspect included for whatever reason should be commended moreover the one who green lit it as go should be recognized as well as well as everyone who took part in that entire sequence actors and creative team included oh and the score itself oh man was that doosy watching the editing quality made me appreciate the air we breathe on day to day basis like never before that entire scene is now an instant classic in the historical book of greatness and nonesuch we all know what chapter this will go into no doubt sorry usually don take the time as is in this moment but could not resist sorry not sorry cheerio gueyes ', ' movie was okay but what was the point for it was really hoping mcu would pull off something spectacular with widow if it were some origin movie that would have been great as well so this means there can be more black widow movies with some pre death stories right and iron man can comeback with more movies pre endgame era naah black widow scarlett johansson absolutely didn deserve this after 10 years ', ' mediocre mcu tv show that tells the story of kamala khan and her love for captain marvel it is an origin story and definitely one of the most disappointing ones made ever it not bad tv show it has some good love matt lintz as bruno he was my favorite character by far in the show also really liked kamala parents and enjoyed the first two episodes those are it for my positives the rest of this review is surrounded by issues with the show and why it so mid the story is very badly written and weak the villains are terrible episode 4 sucked badly the action sequences are no where to be seen as there are barely any the final battle in particular was bad as well also didn like what they did with damage control honestly think the script for the show went unfinished because it seemed like there were lot of forced ideas and stories towards the final episodes of the show there also characters didn care for and passable cgi visual effects although one scene involving green screen is beyond terrible can still watch this show because it paced well has some good acting and it fairly enjoyable also loved the surprise cameos from bollywood pakistani actors average show that was very disappointing letter grade ', ' had basically no expectations and was very pleasantly surprised when the movie turned out to be excellent black widow is not full origin story as we see only glimpses of her upbringing it is much more of family story all the actors and actresses in this movie are amazing especially florence pugh is giving stellar performance really hope we get to see more of her character also liked that the pace of the movie was occasionally much slower than other marvel movies there are longer stretches where the acting and the story carry the movie became aware of this when noticed that there was basically no cgi during these scenes thanks to the cast these scenes were never boring or felt unnecessary the humor is well placed and entertaining without turning the movie into comedy also the 3d worked well and elevated several scenes note that most of the story takes place in 2016 after the events of captain america civil war however the movie completely stands on its own feet there are of course some references to captain america and the avengers but you don need to know these movies to understand or follow black widow 9 10 go see it ideally in movie theater ', ' great acting and writing and fun direction ms marvel has some great runs in the comics and this instalment of the mcu is true to that and am told to the life of pakistani americans about time we had some new and different stories and am glad for it they found gem in the lead actress most people will bomb this with preconceived attack as this is vehicle for women and for minority group but don listen to the haters and have some fun ', ' ve seen the inflated review aggregate and at the risk of being dismissed contrarian seriously disagree with the accolades the avengers movie saw contained no character development whatsoever no character starts off ignorant growing to enlightenment or overcomes cowardice to become hero or any other example of behavioral character arcs by the end they are as they begun unchanged and definitively two dimensional the lack of character development is compounded by uninteresting witless filler dialogue despite few one liners which managed to draw giggle with dr stark and dr banner e the alter egos of iron man and the hulk occasionally foraying into esoteric scientific jibber jabber that only served to bore me even more in saying that downey jr tony stark was the only mildly interesting and amusing character in the entire piece the rest of the characters couldn give shite about despite liking them in their stand alone movies it seems director joss whedon and pen pal zak penn are unaware of the law of diminishing returns whereby the repetition of anything in this case fist fights and gun and super power battles eventually numbs to the point of indifference speaking of indifference the limp wristed laughable horn wearing villain loki was about as menacing as having series of ping pong balls pitched at you and the death of no spoiler here was about as emotionally moving as having your pet weevil larvae die effects wise it seems despite the advances in cgi made by avatar and rise of the planet of the apes the avengers decided to go retrograde the hulk looking nothing more than three dimensional cartoon and likewise with iron man and the endless stream of generic alien henchmen the green screen for the most part looked phony due to the artificial interior lighting illuminating the actor mismatching the natural exterior light of the background an age old problem that some directors don seem to care about however seriously it affects the suspension of disbelief anyway enough of my moaning if you like mindless action with practically no story other than goodies versus baddies and if you re fan of mighty morphin power rangers you ll love this ', ' if it was not the pandemic would have stopped the movie after first 20 minutes total garbage ', ' this is good film but the current overall imdb score of 8 9 is rather high put simply its entertaining and fun however the problem inherent in the film is how to fit so many larger than life characters into one story and give them equal screen time whedon manages to do it but as result feel the story had to fit the characters rather than the characters fit the story there are lot of new character relationships that have to be established it gets little bit convoluted trying to keep up with itself the threat facing the avengers e loki and his rather randomly sourced army just seems bit cobbled together especially the army where they came from or what they are doesn seem properly explained just that loki somehow has one the threat the avengers face seems more to do with sheer numbers of bad guys rather than any particularly interesting powerful individual villains loki on his own just doesn seem that threatening he is wonderfully without remorse though bitter and twisted by his quest for revenge one of his scenes with black widow is almost like hannibal lector and clarice in silence of the lambs black widow for my money is the most entertaining and interesting character in the film maybe its because she doesn actually have any super powers that makes her so what she does have is an exceptional mind attitude and rather scary hand to hand combat skills played wonderfully by scarlet johannson she is pleasure in practically every scene one of the other pleasurable things about this film is the occasionally very funny dialogue and scenes whedon is master of witty fast paced exchanges and he doesn disappoint here the cinema audience laughed hard many times the hulk having the two biggest laughs in the film this is decent film which could have went horribly wrong lot of lead characters vying for screen time is problem time spent establishing new relationships also perhaps the next one will be more compelling the film isn overly subtle but then what did expect given the nature of its premise ', ' love this show ve followed all the marvel shows on netflix the punisher and daredevils season 2 both amazing what happened with luke cage and jessica jones loved the first season of iron fist and can get threw the 2nd episode of 2nd season the defenders was pretty good hopin to see 2nd ', ' brie larson less than stellar acting leaves you enduring the movie regularly checking your watch so you can find something more worthwhile to do don waste your money on it ', ' seriously this is it the movie is boring and really just drags on there were hardly any action or fighting scenes and what little they did have was very mediocre it felt like spy agent movie and nothing as good as what marvel typically puts out it felt as if they didn even bother with the story and just quickly threw together something and stuck black widow as the title ', ' this film while can be fun and entertaining is very safe and follows the marvel formula the story in itself doesn progress the plot of the mcu and adds little to the black widows arc introduces some fun new characters that have potential in the mcu future but uses them very poorly or not at all prime example being the red guardian played by david harbour russian super soldier that obsessed with being back in his costume could ve had extremely fun fight scenes with violence and extreme uses of strength but instead ends ups being the comic relief and the butt of the joke another example of characters not used properly is the villain taskmaster made into generic villain and has next to no similarities to its comic book counterpart the end credit scene is the only piece of the movie that develops the mcu showing what could come next potentially for the hawkeye series or further ahead ', ' think the title says it all enjoyed every second of the movie worth watch and all other marvel movies m not fan but when the movie is great it great ', ' it rubbish the writing is terrible do not even think to find anything interesting to watch the jokes are cringe the main character is empty no personality whatsoever same clich of teenage girl not popular in school there is no story and don care at all about the characters could barely watch it until the end and it left me bad taste not even being curious to see the next episode the cliffhanger was let say non existent it really shame to see something like this from marvel the worst first episode ever ', ' exceptional performance by brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani as carol danvers captain marvel monica rambeau and kamala khan ms marvel respectively samuel jackson is back with fury as nick fury and bringing the much needed energy and comic relief as usual highly encourage watching the following marvel movies and tv series in order to thoroughly prepare for the marvels avengers infinity war 2018 captain marvel 2019 avengers endgame 2019 the marvels storyline picks up right after each of the main stars respective storylines and manages to combine their story arc into unique and marvelous manner keeping it consistent with some of the current events within the broad marvel cinematic universe and developing our heroes from individual stars into team of superstars the costumes are aesthetically pleasing zawe ashton plays the part of dar benn the antagonist in the marvels would have loved to see more of her character backstory and hope that we get to see more backgrounds being unpacked either through marvel tv series or even an television special the movie runtime is 105 minutes making it the shortest marvel movie in the marvel cinematic universe the story felt little bit rushed considering dangerous mission is underway to prevent world level ramifications but no time is wasted to deliver yet another masterpiece in the cinematic universe the story delivers few unique twists lots of humor and few surprises the movie definitely contains something for everyone young and old and encourage you to take the whole family to experience the marvels the marvels is story that keeps the golden thread which is the marvel cinematic universe and still manages to peak higher further and faster into the multiversal trajectory the trailer doesn spoil much but as always secret awaits for those who eagerly pay attention to the marvel trailers my only worry is that usually key spoilers tend to emerge in the week following the release of the movie in the forms of updated sneak peaks and mini trailers there is mid credits scene that you don want to miss but no post credits scene rate this movie 8 out of 10 really excited to see what the future holds for captain marvel watch at cinema near you ', ' this was simply the best movie have ever witnessed didn really like super hero movies until saw the avengers but came out of the theater screaming because of how awesome it was wanted to tell the world how great it is and still do and this is the best way for every epic moment there is something hilarious to follow it up came out with the thought that every one of the super heroes was total bada and samuel jackson is awesome too he gets done read some of the bad reviews and most say that there is no real emotion but if you actually pay attention you can see small things that make sense and relate to history and stuff just lost my train of thought good day sir go see this movie ', ' so after months of waiting for it and getting some excellent reviews about it finally went to see the avengers at the movie theatres and here is how felt it was exciting visually mesmerizing and very well acted and directed the avengers is superb to any movie lover and is full entertainment from the start and the brilliant visual effects the great acting by the whole cast who really justify their characters and some great direction by joss whedon just makes it even better and worth the watch and great entertainment throughout the watch the story which is quite reknown is based on the comics named as the same with the 6 superhero coming together to make an alliance and defeat the villain loki the brother of thor who mission is to rule the whole world and with some help of his alien friends he gets very powerful to really test the avengers the acting by the whole cast is quite superb and every person have done their character justice by portraying these superhero very well but thought robert downey jr as iron man jeremy renner as hawkeye and tom hiddleton as loki really took the cake as they were quite excellent in portraying their characters robert downey was his quite arrogent self as the iron man renner again gives powerful performance as the hawkeye and tom hiddleton is really good and cunning enemy who is also quite influential and powerful the humour by the characters are also quite good and it really does nt let the movie go bland the direction by joss whedon in this movie is quite superb as he has done convincing job in making one of the best 3d movies in the past year with excellent 3d effects great acting by each and everyone in the cast which he helped in and the shots taken in the movie specially in the last battle in manhatten are really breathtaking and for that the cinematographer seamus mcgarvey also deserves his due credit for giving us such breathtaking scenes but whedon has really made one of the best visually enthralling and one of the better superhero movies of all time he does nt let the movie go bland or boring by keeping the humour coming in and with fight scenes in good times he really has entertained the audience the story of course which is known by many comic fans is quite great and the screenwriter who is also joss whedon and the derivers from the comics whedon and zak penn have taken an interesting and gripping story which has ensure in entertaining the audience throughout the movie and really keeping you at the edge of your seat the visual effects and the 3d effects as said earlier are quite simply superb and one of the better 3d movies of the past year and the 3d effects in all of the fighting scene are really breathtaking and hats off to the visual team for doing such great job with the visual effects which make this movie so good the music of the movie is quite good too and really sets the tone in the atmosphere of the movie and really liked the background score so music director alan silvestri also deserves his due credit for his contribution towards this movie and the contribution by each staff really needs appreciation this movie really deserves watch by anyone who likes entertaining movies and really deserves to be seen in 3d and this is one of the better superhero and 3d movies of the past time and this really is bright sign to the great summer blockbusters to come in the near future 8 10 ', ' was so excited to watch this series after watching 2 episodes stopped watching the direction and the narration of the story are horrible simply wasted my data and this is the worst series of marvel am an indian at least some parts of the culture are the same but still can justify the way they have done it ', ' disney must think everyone who watches tv has negative iq because this show is just plain stupid it not funny it not goofy they re trying very hard to play the humour card but it a hard fall the result is plain stupidity too many dumb shows on disneyplus m going to cancel my subscription ', ' extremely entertaining show which has several problems that prevent it from getting higher grade the animation is little choppy did not feel jason sudeikis is the right voice actor for the role am excited for how they set up the 2nd season but did not feel the ending for the first season worked like most of the characters and the story endless fun ', ' this was another one of my most favorite flicks of all time movie that kept me on the edge of my seat and finding it hard to hit the pause button to go do what comes needed after several cold refreshments appreciate the serious side of the movie with the battle scenes but for me what was more enjoyable was the comedic parts that kept me interested and laughing at just the right times the special effects and sound score was something worth mentioning and would suggest turning the lights down low and cranking up the surround sound whilst watching this epic tale pulled straight from the comic books of marvel ', ' somebody needs to fire some of the idiots making decisions at netflix why cancel shows that have great ratings ', ' don be fooled by the great review score thought it must be worth try but honestly it just snoozefest pretty much the same thing happens time after time the fight scenes are so predictable and boring very rarely give up on show but got to e12 of season 2 and couldn take anymore just had no interest in anything that was happening if you have hero that can never die there is never any real peril so the whole thing really needs good plot it doesn ', ' it would be for children of maximum 13 14 years old if you are older advise you to save your time looking at other things was watching it and it was impossible for me to get past chapter 2 constantly wanting each chapter to end very sad ', ' review by kamal the film starts really well but the main bad guy dreykov is pretty generic and has some bad dialouge which is bordering on cheesy the movies ending isn as crazy as other mcu movie endings but it still very over the top the actual movie itself seems bit late late to the party we already know black widow is going to live so there was no sense of danger for her character and it didn quite seem like positive send off for her either it felt very displaced in saying all of that though it still an exciting film and it has some genuinely funny commentary throughout on the mcu and specifically black widows journey within it the one thing am dissapointed about is the portrayal of taskmaster ', ' as season 2 draws to an end there is huge cliffhanger made all the more enticing by the apparent destruction of some characters the introduction of new one and the transformation of two others agents of h e d exists in the marvel universe populated by some historic marvel characters but not so dependent upon knowledge of the characters that novice viewer cannot enjoy it the writers have done on good job of producing dramatic episodes and surprising story lines the characters as you expect from series based upon comic books include likable hero types and evil villains the strong cast is up to the challenge and they are capable of delivering the occasionally cheesy line as required made all the more delicious by the tongue in cheek humor the intentionally melodramatic lines for those who wish to take their viewing to another level the marvel world is expanding on television and the big screen in some cases there are overlaps that are fun to discover in january agent carter will have her own mini series for example am looking forward to the third season update 1 13 18 should have updated this review before now because this series has earned more than 7 am going straight to 9 because season 5 comes with genius level transformation of the plot very gutsy high risk yields high reward here it an inspired game changing twist ', ' well made decent story fantastic acting but very clearly aimed at younger more female demographic and to be fair that nice to see lot of the superhero stuff is overly masculine sure there is wonder woman and similar but they go around smashing stuff up like their male counterparts so this breaks the mold bit and it no surprise to see reviews reflecting this fairly significant change to the superhero universe it pushes the protagonist wit and character forward supported by some gnarly matriarchs as her main strength ', ' before watching had no idea about what to expect from this movie and only watched this movie becoz of samuel jackson becoz wanted to know how he handled the situation and how he lost his god damn eye but when watched this movie enjoyed this movie lot captain marvel manages to take the best ideas of early mcu origin stories like iron man and thor and use them to form something that feels both familiar and fresh there many heroic moments of nick furry and captain marvel but honestly speaking don care about captain marvel beocz her acting was pathetic and she has no expression on tge face at all it is only becoz of samuel jackson which binds to the movie till the end and also she seemed overpowered and when she is doing capatin marvel stuff don feel that great as feel like in thor or captain america films it can be bit on the nose at times and occasionally has to fast track its exposition in ways that can feel slightly clunky but what it lacks in grace it makes up for in charm my rating 7 10 ', ' first to give creds the 6th and final episode somewhat rocked in comic book kinda way very action oriented and fairly goofy but fun sadly it was the only episode really worth watching what we find here is supposed super hero story almost totally buried in ethnic trappings have no bias in this but didn come here to be tutored in pakistani history and daily life which seems to be the primary theme of this show oh and there some super hero thrown in it just not what most people were expecting or hoping for and it simply wasn all that well written after moon knight all we need is another show about clumsy bumbling clueless super hero okay she a teen this is probably pretty realistic as far as how things would go if someone suddenly had powers they didn know how to use but honestly her power singular is pretty sad and tends to do more damage than good this is what disney decided to serve the audience well it all disney and not much marvel bottom line they could do better than steal other super hero names and turn the character into something completely different we go in with the idea of an immensely super powered hero only to find teenage girl who can create what magic ice then that final post credits scene what was that there all about totally unexpected unexplained out out concept and just leaves us hanging what was that disney making last ditch effort to clean up the plot mess after countless viewer complaints they should have lead with that seriously all said by the time the show was over was somewhat interested in her home life and the pakistani lifestyle so creds for that we all need our horizons expanded but that not what anyone went in for not what anyone expected and it most certainly isn ms marvel miss ice machine anyone ', ' what load of long winded rubbish you can fit all the action scenes in to half time superbowl show and still have time left over to watch the half time superbowl show this bloated wordy drama should have been edited down to made for tv movie but that still wouldn be enough editing to keep anyone awake m guessing the writers are teenage girls as this is the cheesiest bilge water ve seen from marvel franchise every camera angle is close up head shot so there no sense of atmosphere or space watched the whole 13 crapisodes with the fast forward button as my friend and still don know why the bad guys were so bad it never clear why they are bad or what bad things they do but they are enemies of the daredevil and his puerile panty wetting chums so they are the bad guys oh you only get to see the daredevil in his daredevil costume at the very end of the very last episode well let hope it the last episode second series of this melodramatic tripe would make my eyes bleed there way to much blubbering in every episode what is it with americans and crying on the telly they just can stop themselves can they there also way too much talking and all the talking is in stupid riddles the limited action scenes are filmed in pitch black so you have to guess what going on the fight sequencers are tedious long and difficult to make out if you thought that brian fighting the chicken was long and tedious then you re in for major shock this is longer and more tedious with the added distraction of being impossible to see if you re daredevil fan stick with the comics this garbage will just bore you to death ', ' this is one of those rare shows where 2nd season is better than 1st action be it gun fights car chase or fist fights are better than any movie ive seen in decade marvel punisher fans would love it but someone like me who doesn follows comics would love it too ', ' this movie fits for kids better don recommend ', ' this is what we have been waiting for the culmination of years of planning years of filming and years of cross pollination of characters throughout the marvel movie universe the bar was set unbelievably high and did my best to temper my expectations as walked into the theater along with the millions upon millions of moviegoers this opening weekend when the lights dropped mentally wiped the slate clean and hoped beyond hope that it was good at least better than iron man 2 as so many other people have said by now was more than pleased the avengers follows the beginning of one of marvel comics most powerful supergroups as the world finds itself woefully unprepared for an alien onslaught led by the scorned demi god loki while the various heroes don play nicely together at first they come together when the time comes and prove they are much more powerful together than apart together they are unstoppable many of the reviews have been focusing on mark ruffalo and his charismatic portrayal of bruce banner aka the hulk originally much of the focus was on him because he is now the third actor in as many films to play the legendary green behemoth yet after the release the buzz stayed on him because he brought something to hulk that was sorely lacking before humanity arguably ruffalo wasn on screen ton and it hard to say whether we have been so amazed with his performance if it was ninety minutes or more but since marvel and company immediately signed him to six picture deal to continue being big green and angry we will all get our chance to test the theory out ve always loved ruffalo as an actor and have all the faith in the world he can make this rage monster dynamic character to watch but the real gamble will come in the script we ve seen full movies with eric bana and edward norton already so this next one or two or three need to bring something different not just rehash of those before luckily the avengers phenomenon also allows the next hulk picture to skip over the origin story since it fairly unnecessary now while ruffalo can rightly bask in the glow of job exceedingly well done the rest of the cast deserves praise as well everyone up and down the line brought their game and they played off each other incredibly well robert downey jr can sometimes overshadow people on screen just due to his charisma but he did exactly what he said his character of tony stark aka iron man couldn do play nicely with others however the pressure was really more on jeremy renner as hawkeye and scarlett johansson as black widow since they were only side jobs in some of the previous marvel chapters each did great job with extra credit given to johannson and possibly her fight double if she had one for her intro sequence with the russian mobsters can close this review out without bringing up one of the real life superheros of the story writer director joss whedon the man is living legend in the geek community and this film proves the accolades and unending praise are well founded he achieved perfect balance of action pace and story all while managing to encompass the overabundance of characters jokes were well timed and well delivered and he allowed for possibly risky moments to go all out resulting in one of the most hilarious and enjoyable scenes in marvel movie history you ll know it when you see it sure there are some nit picky moments that you can dig up if you re so inclined feel free to send me what you think those might be and ll gladly drop in some of mine yet in the end the experience is what counts and couldn wipe the smile off my face as left and not just because the final extra scene at the end of the final credits was pure genius this movie captured absolutely every bit of the tone and energy of comic book summer blockbuster and if whedon was professor this would be his master class ', ' m gonna cut straight to the point this is overall solid show the reason why most people don like it is because it not white character and that it the overall show was fun you enjoy the parents they feel natural the main character feels like an actual teenager especially when was going to school in the 90s he is just in the clouds action scenes aren bad but like said it a show that involves kid just learning to use her powers you really get to learn the backstory of the characters the culture and little bit of history as well which can never hurt the characters stays true to the source ', ' can keep 10 and 13 yr old interested it like an old disney channel teen show or nick this is disney marvel no doubt think the 2nd episode did it in for us it not intersting well acted and so much cough cough just seems forced and unnecessary ', ' awful acting as well as script there is no continuity in the story line and it is frustratingly annoying doesn make sense and tries to copy other netflix marvel shows in direct contrast of the punisher this is total fail poor selection of actors make this show terrible watch no idea why anyone would give this more than 1 star advice for the production team stop trying to copy other shows and perhaps hire few new script writers and while you re at it some better direction for the actors ', ' just watched the last episode and must say this is was not good said to myself that if the show will be better than the runaways will be satisfied but no the first 3 eps were good and interesting but from the 4th ep it lost me of course there were mentions of evil white man but this is the least of my problems with the show there were too many empty and shallow characters the villains were horrible they should have split up this story into 2 seasons where kamala is in new jersey and in the second season she goes to pakistan this show could have been lighthearted fun but it is just boring mess sadly ', ' for those that say that the show seems too woke and childish please check the source material binge watch the mcu catalogue and then try to tie the loose ends between source and the mcu to give helpful opinion ms marvel is lovely story about fangirl that somehow found that have what it takes to be hero and while she muslim and pakistani isn shows shoehorned praise about islam or extreme pakistani nationalism which is entirely welcome nowadays with the current state of affairs where radicalism is close to the corner and instead shows the long way of doing what is right and learn to grow up to understand the layers of everything around her and twist ending that left me begging for more without feeling out of place looking at you eternals about the artwork and soundtrack it joined the holy trinity of awesomeness sitting next to black panther and spider man into the spider verse not bad for kiddie tv show ', ' it doesn seem like the marvel show is going on look like some pakistani typical show is going on marvel charm missing and dialogues and acting skill also poor the pace of the show is too slow and the story doesn seem like dam too ', ' please stop if you can write or atleast cast good main characters please stop making any more series horrible story horribe actoresses weak heros please work on loki what if and others good project now don screw those also ', ' ms marvel is lot of fun great story and characters gets the feel of the comics spot on ignore the review bombing racist haters and give it watch ', ' at least it not the worst marvel movie ever ahem thor love thunder but glad that didn watch this in the cinema it had enjoyable moments vellani was great as ms marvel she felt like the star of the show the campy feel and musical bits were amusing liked parris as photon wanted to like larson but she always seems so uncomfortable as captain marvel dar benn felt under developed the plot was painfully predictable overall there was potential but not much substance it felt more like it should have been disney series rather than movie maybe marvel reign is finally over and james gunn will bring in golden age for dc ', ' it better than what the critics are saying this is not bad movie have few tiny nit picks but overall good film my favorite part was anything with florence pugh as yelena ', ' brie larson shines as carol danvers aka captain marvel powerful badass charismatic emotional an inspiration to everyone all the interactions between the characters are amazing the story is refreashing and wonderfully executed ', ' average filmmaking here are few words which can describe this film unnecessary uninteresting disappointing re watch another marvel film to shake off the dullness after you are done with black widow m not saying don watch it but once you do you will know by the way my reviews for black widow here keep getting deleted so here another one ', ' the most dedicated marvel movie has been to its central mechanic since ant man and the wasp so it shouldn come as much of surprise that this is probably one of the most entertaining and funniest ones of these we ve gotten lately highlights are when it completely commits to its own absurdity or the leads play off of each other in words and in action though have my gripes with both most of this is still the usual expository slog you ve come to expect from this franchise in this instance made even worse by the incessant use of in universe jargon that even as someone who has trudged through nearly all of it leading up to this makes the dialogue and the plot it means to build almost incomprehensible just try reading the film description on the page here and you ll have good idea of what mean the action scenes themselves are pretty fun when they use the switch gimmick which lends itself to dynamically choreographed fights though as usual it rarely used to its full potential but most of it suffers from the increasingly prevalent problem these films have been facing where most of these powers are fantasy fluff that fall beyond the realm of my grasp the avengers days where every hero felt appropriately super yet still abided by grounded logic are far behind us here m at loss as to what strength beam of light has or what our main players could be hurt and damaged by truly want to give this higher score but the occasional laugh and directorial flourishes like intermittent use of splitscreen being very generous here calling attention to something so barebones aren enough to distract from the truly terrible script that seems as lacking in logic and consistency as its heroes powers and the overall feeling like this was just box to tick so the mcu can move to other things mere link to be made between think unabashedly hating this is little harsh it pretty much non stop action apart from an exposition dump in the midpoint and clocks in at tidy 105 minutes making it the shortest mainline mcu feature not good film but certainly good time ', ' if you enjoy reading my spoiler free reviews please follow my blog as fair and impartial film critic need to state this don care about the controversy surrounding brie larson or the agendas this movie is trying to push or not m not part of any hate group or factions that hate those hate groups just want to watch good superhero origin film that introduces me to new character that m supposed to care about and root for read my review sure but make up your own mind go see the movie and be honest since that out of the way let keep going it was always going to be huge risk trying to introduce such an important and powerful character like carol danvers into the end of phase three not only she comes from nowhere as far as remember she was barely mentioned in previous films or even not mentioned at all before infinity war but it the last movie before the climactic era ending avengers endgame she is the one who is going to take our heroes to victory against thanos the bad guy who dare say easily defeated on his own pretty much every superhero we knew until that moment so while was not expecting an outstanding story packed with phenomenal action was also hoping for more than just simple origin film like it came from phase one unfortunately that exactly what got everything is fine just okay there no exceptional fight scene but most of it is decent there no visual wonder but it doesn look bad the characters potential feels wasted but they work for the plot everything is frustratingly balanced which is something would praise in bunch of other movies but this isn 2008 anymore marvel isn starting its cinematic universe it is almost finishing whole arc involving more than 20 installments m going straight to the one character everyone wants to talk about goose sorry captain marvel jokes aside this is one of the issues was worried about going into the film theater escaped 99 of the marketing for this movie as do with every other flick didn watch single clip trailer know as much about the controversy surrounding this installment as my dog and kept my expectations realistic having in mind what truly know about the film and only the film itself the one thing was not able to hide from were the headlines giving tremendous praise to cat now follow me on this m going to watch superhero origin movie whole new character is waiting for me at the big screen m excited to know more about her where does she come from what her powers are and so much more some headlines show up on my social media feed and find that cat steals the show deserves spin off and don even know what more granted the cat is indeed funny it provides some chuckles here and there that it love cats but honestly can figure out why everyone is so amazed by an animal doing animal things maybe it because the rest of the film isn that entertaining or perhaps just because people really really love cats like the movie itself think it a mixture of both options back to what matters and to who everyone should be talking about brie larson marvel rarely misses its casting choices and being larson an academy award winner her talent is undeniable she has everything she needs to consistently deliver strong performance so m surprised that she couldn stand out from the film overall blandness repeat the movie isn bad at all however was expecting an actress of brie larson caliber to elevate at least her own character but she like everyone else just good enough don know if her performance was limited by bad direction or by her own decisions but the potential is there and m sure the russo brothers will give her much more thrilling arc in endgame the two best attributes of the entire film are without single doubt the buddy cop relationship that carol and nick fury samuel jackson develop and the groundbreaking de aging cgi story wise the interactions between these two characters are so captivating and humorous that the pacing issues of the first act gradually start to disappear carol past is often approached with quick flashes and lot of cheap exposition so it a breath of fresh air to have slj and larson play off of each other nevertheless the de aging technology used is absolutely astounding my fellow readers welcome to the future of filmmaking where any actor actress can portray younger version of themselves and not be visually disturbing completely forgot slj is 70 years old the best visual effects cgi are the ones you don even know they re there and captain marvel succeeds in delivering mind blowing realistic younger versions of well known actors character wise anna boden and ryan fleck should have done way better so much wasted potential in such crucial moment in the mcu carol danvers has great backstory but the way it was explored kind of diminishes its impact still as captain marvel she is indeed badass woman there are some cool action sequences especially in the beginning but as the movie slowly progresses on its story the fight scenes got more sloppy choppy and way too dark jude law yon rogg is amazing as he always is and ben mendelsohn is brilliant as talos both characters have interesting subplots that come together well which is not something that can be said for the rest of the marvel villains technically you guessed it it okay taking away the jaw dropping de aging cgi the visuals seem to lack some sort of style looking back at black panther captain america or guardians of the galaxy each movie has visual aesthetic that belongs to their own stories captain marvel doesn really feel like it has its own style truly feel that with other directors this film could have been way better boden and fleck already proved that they are capable filmmakers but maybe they were not ready to lead such massive blockbuster that said the 90s score is awesome and quite adequate to the movie period there are couple of moments where the vfx regarding carol danvers powers are spectacular but everything ultimately feels like this is phase one film instead of the 21st mcu installment all in all captain marvel achieves the minimum requirements introduce the fans to new superhero who is going to be extremely important in the eventual defeat of thanos carol danvers is fascinating character with an emotional backstory but the screenplay isn structured or explored in the most entertaining way possible brie larson delivers strong performance pushing aside her haters even if feel that under other directors she would have reached her character full potential her scenes with samuel jackson are hilarious and the best part of the whole movie as well as the groundbreaking de aging cgi which is absolutely mind blowing the action sequences needed better editing and some more choreography this is mcu phase three and 2019 so want to be able to actually see what happening but the most prominent issue is how the story blindly obeys the superhero origin film formula this isn exactly flaw or problem it just that was expecting more lot more in the end there not memorable fight scene an emotionally overwhelming moment or even genuinely bone chilling epic scene it doesn leave you salivating for avengers endgame but it also doesn leave you less excited everything is just fine and there nothing wrong with that but there also nothing extraordinary ', ' if you are past your teens then think that you will find this outing very immature if they did not have the childish animations throughout then show would have been much better would have thought that kevin feige could have spread the budget little to have main mcu character to make cameo ', ' m surprised nobody is talking about the actor who played wilson fisk never saw such level of perfection except christian bale did for batman proper justification for character named wilson fisk everything is perfect when it comes to superhero stuff ', ' obviously this is only based on episode 1 but this show is really dragging so far given the limited number of episodes wouldn have expected so much time to be wasted watching teenager argue with her parents the bulk of the episode was very low stakes and uneventful perhaps 2 episode premiere would have helped to show the direction of the story hopefully this was just one episode with focus on character building and the future episodes will be more entertaining and plot driven ', ' overall d say black widow slightly exceeded my expectations although admittedly my expectations weren very high the movie is okay the 134 minute runtime didn drag like thought it would but it wasn particularly good either the comedic moments are fine and the action is fast however the action does nothing new and it can be bit bland the villain of the movie is also pretty lame as an exploration of natasha character it ok despite being years too late spoiler alert don get too attached to her guess it tells the story of her troubled past well but it doesn really add anything interesting to her personality don feel any more of connection to her character now than did before watching it essentially feels like the purpose of the movie is to bring florence pugh character into the mcu rather than coming from genuine desire to tell natasha story the multi billion dollar mcu pushing industrialized uninspired media out it crazy to think about know as far as the acting goes everyone was fine although thought the russian accents were kind of awful it kind of disappointing to see florence pugh take her career in this direction though at least scarlett johansson is free now 4 8 10 also jeremy renner should have been in this movie ', ' it a great action thriller type of show but the obvious snippets of leftist propaganda make maintaining immersion in the story difficult no holier than thou writers we don care to hear you occasionally repeating democrat talking points and jabs at anything resembling the current positions of the republican party ', ' if your fan of the mcu then you ll love this new installment to the amazing franchise just leaves you wanting to see more bring on endgame ', ' the marvels first of all if you re marvel fan you know you have to see everything that came before the movie to understand captain marvel wandavision and ms marvel are wonderful movies tv shows and should be watched regardless of this movie but it a heck of lot easier to understand the plot if you ve seen them first the marvels captivated me the way marvel movies tend to do but this one was different the themes of family coming of age revenge guilt and teamwork are fully brought to life marvel has always been more than just hulk smash the stories resonate with me as enjoy the human or non human interactions that continue across multiple movies and shows the characters develop through interpersonal relationships as they grow and learn which for us fanboys means more of it as marvel has this uncanny ability to inspire feelings of family and friendship for the fictional characters the attention to detail is and as you know there will be moments that gasp in the theatre with surprise and happiness know did stay for the mid credit scene they always have one of course but this wow have been waiting over 30 years and it finally happening ', ' loved this show man kicks ass takes names and get things done the drama and writing were excellent acting and set and and all the other details were fantastic just love that the only complaint comes from white ultra conservative men who are sensitive about some message they feel it pushes which find amusing since if anything the show promotes the good guy with gun argument that these people are always touting the main character is literally that good guy vigilante with gun the other paragon of virtue is karen page rules defying reporter with concealed carry who makes cogent and personal argument for guns one would think they love this show but the fact it says anything other than full throated roar for what they believe in they give it negative reviews who the snowflake now ', ' first of all didn watch that many superhero movies so sadly don know much about the different characters and their universes but like the idea of bringing them all together in single movie and for me it works the whole concept is great idea and the story is really good and exciting also love the effects and the different characters that are thrown together also love that it portrays superheroes with different strengths but also their weaknesses they aren portrayed as superhuman as you could expect they all have many things to learn and their flaws so what more can say as guy that don know anything about marvels universes else than it is really recommendable and it deserves top score ', ' what terrible terrible movie none of the characters and do mean none is remotely interesting in fact the only character to really stand out is iron man but his ironic punchlines get old very very fast he just there for comic relief but by the time he pours his 20th joke it just annoying the action scenes are just boring watching computer made polygons fight each other hardly matches my definition of excitement if only cared about the characters might have enjoyed them but since didn it was just borefest here the thing about hollywood they try to make action scenes as impressive as possible but if you do not care about the characters you won care about what happens to them you would have just as much enjoyment reading the script than watching this movie because the direction is non existent this movie embodies everything that wrong with hollywood nowadays nothing is new or surprising in this movie if you haven seen hollywood movie for 4 years you might enjoy this one otherwise you ll just be bored by the same old crap as usual ', ' another dump from disney marvel super annoying parents characters no chemistry between them yeah we get it you re being inclusive can get over the different culture and what not but the show itself is just lame my nieces seemed to enjoy it for bit then even they just lost interest 2 episodes so far why go this direction when they have all this material to choose from beats me im skipping the rest of this one for sure ', ' nicely put together show that blends originality with crude humour and drama perfectly love that it not quite superhero show but it is oscar nomination nomination goes to jason sudeikis for his continuously sudeikis performance ', ' people who aren of the target audience not even gonna point out the obvious screaming that its childish and cringey maybe because its aimed towards younger girls as an 18 year old young woman enjoyed this show even if it wasn for me as could clearly see what the source material towards unlike the screaming man children ', ' really enjoyed this movie far more than thought that would wasn intending to watch this movie but on recommendation of my daughter realized that should give it shot admit that it had some interesting parts and it was quite comical some of the lines from samuel jackson nick fury were the best parts of the movie the action sequences and the lessons and morale that are evident through the story are engrossing and the characters each have both relatable good qualities and few natural flaws that make them seem believable the mcu ideals of incursions and universes overlapping starts to play out to tie in other attributes of the marvel worlds and it was fun to see how they did that no need for spoilers obviously but will say as with all marvel films make sure you stay until the end of the credits to see bonus scene that gives interesting insight into what may or may not occur within the mcu next ', ' ok m sucker for hard boiled hard drinking raymon chandler esq noir but this succeeds where other attempts have failed agent carter for instance because each and every character has depth and nuance and motivation rarely seen on the small screen will admit the first season is bit better than the second but recently rewatched the second and found some things missed it very good as well ', ' they could have taken it even further and make the dad also woman the only man should have been the bad guy ', ' this is the first marvel film ve genuinely laughed with since ragnarok loved kamala khan as always and her family was as delightful as ever the breezy writing kept even captain marvel who can be so dour enjoyable and rounded as character the switches were clever way to limit these character unmanageable superpowers and the kittens and the princess scene made me day ok but so did kamala dad giving financial advice haha inventive and fresh this movie is delight in franchise that become kind of heavy and lorer laden also minimal multiverse so you can hang with the narrative and not have to keep track of too many plot lines super fun ', ' this review title makes as much sense as the movie itself was hoping for good old marvel movie flair instead found new era disney style movie for kiddos blended with teen video gamers style all over the place fights scenes which makes as much sense as cinderella meets star war crossover didn recognise the traditional and genuine marvel touch at any point during the movie either it a big fail or marvel has decided to take whole new road aiming only at kids and teens thus making the movie end game an end game for the generations who loved the first phases wonder how it will affect the new men since they popped in during the end credits ', ' this was very widely anticipated film and it had big impact as well yet it did not leave much of an impression on me the only thing ll give it credit for is balancing all of the cast quite well it features lot of main characters and juggles their screentime quite effectively however the story itself is quite forgettable and devolves into generic cgi battle against generic alien army with generic sky beam posing as the ultimate threat ', ' for one am glad to see show about teenager that isn grown up or has it all together or is some next level avatar of captain kickallasses it is these viewers who will be watching this content when we are dead think people complaining about this have never read comic book ', ' just discovered that lot of my indian colleagues and friends were asking each other to rate this movie 1 star despite loving the season starter later they explained that ms marvel should have been an indian character as marvel makes more money from india than pakistan ', ' what in the world was the purpose of this movie it was terrible theatre movie won go as far to say that it was waste of time because have seen movies that are waste of time that you never get back what would say is this movie was scripted and directed more properly for direct to dvd instead of theatre promise that will not provide any spoilers because you know what didn really get the whole story the three main characters were complete mess nothing really meshed with them together now there were some funny parts kamala khan parents provided some comedy relief but not for every scene they were in some of their lines were just overblown and eye rolling brie larson had some funny lines too this movie kind of reminded me of deadpool except deadpool was outrageously ridiculous in the fighting so you just are there to watch without thinking the problem with this movie is that tried not to think about this movie and was completely confused the fighting action the lines that ms marvel spewed out without context the actions again nothing made bunch of sense to me am surprised that some people at the theatre laughed pretty hard at many of the scenes to each their own guess this is where will say that this movie was not complete waste of time think it had potential but it lacked lot of substance lot of girl power but probably waaaaay too much as got lost in some of the power management scenes you could argue that this is movie might have been better watched muted m just exaggerating but the story was really terrible it as if the writers just threw whaterver together and said ok let go with that because have to get home for dinner really disliked the story for kamala khan she made no sense and confused me from the beginning of the movie had feeling this movie was going to be bad but glad it was discounted ticket price and we like marvel movies oh just one post credit scene too lame ', ' the actress who plays ms marvel is magnetic and the series looks quite unique but the storyline is just boring gave up in episode 3 the action is not that good either ', ' am so amazed to see pakistani girl in marvel movie they have done great job the movie is so funny and entertaining the pakistani touch they give in this movie is good marvel is marvelous ', ' positives the entire cast musical score action scenes directing negatives not much ', ' my wife and sat and watched this on saturday we expected fun marvel superhero movie and that is what scarlett gave us didn expect shakesperian tragedy which some reviewers seem to expect there was one hollywood trend that stood out in this movie but is not confined to this movie it was also noticeable in the tomorrow war if you ve seen both movies you know the trend m talking about and don believe it helpful to our society at large great graphics and action sequences and don worry too much about the integrity of dialogue in an action flick loved the performances af the four main characters will probably watch it again sometime great way to kill some time and entertaining m not sure what more good action flick is supposed to do ', ' wanted more daredevil punisher the story line got pretty boring could have completely done without the female cop story line just annoying and unnecessary too many flashbacks story line drags lost interest with too many sub plots but most frustrating netflix had to go and ruin the show appeal by pandering to the liberal anti gun troops are bad guns are bad white christian nra members are bad pc bullish add some feminism to the mix to appease all of the liberal left again hollywood sh on good thing why does there always have to be some political bs agenda being preached in every damn show now netflix you had perfect opportunity all around disappointment ', ' m not sure why everyone is hating on this can only assume it because it different the marvels to me is aimed at younger audience it not as dark as other marvel films and because of this took my 9 year old daughter for father and daughter trip as it a 12a in the uk any child under 12 can go but must be accompanied after see ms marvel come out used it to bring my daughter into the world of superheros because it aimed at younger audience and so this appealed to my daughter both due to the age of ms marvel and the way the show was written which was then able to lead her into this film knowing she knew the character already this film is definitely aimed at younger audience and to me and one of my reasons for taking her was to show that girls can kick butt too it had plenty of funny scenes to keep me and my daughter laughing hard and some epic well made fight scenes say epic in that the way most of them where funny and well put together please if you have pre teen teen daughter inspire them that girls can be superheros too and go watch this film together for action laughter and above all hope that girls are just as super as boys ve now got to watch another disney series to help her understand the last few moments of the film but that gives us an opportunity to have even more quality time together 3 ', ' the whole movie is an absolutely mockery of the viewer intelligence with lot of dumb scenes m not going to spoil m marvel fan and appreciate the fact that other marvel fans are rally to defend this movie but you can just support something blindly especially not this terrible movie ', ' marvel finally back to doing what they are good at again funny witty full of chemistry between actors both the leading and supporting cast and the classic marvel feels good touch we love this want more with brie iman and teyonah they were simply brilliant the supporting cast especially kamela family had perfect comedic timing the positive and loving family that wants to be supportive and protective was portrait effortlessly the relatable storylines between characters in the middle of superhero chaos brought us back to the magic of marvel after few misses from marvel this feels like the start of something much better looking forward to strong female lead scripts like this one where women empower other women ', ' marvel seems to have perfected the most efficient way to make movies like csi there is always some sort of plan for how the movie will go it has template with different characters but it always seems to go the same way ve seen almost every movie in the mcu but unless am right or am just getting seriously superhero fatigued this movie is not unlike every other movie we ve seen before it getting old and seems like mcu writer have lost originality it not complaint necessarily it entertains at least once but there is no rewatch value this movie is just like every other mcu movie that put out you aren missing anything ', ' this film is pretty bad corny jokes random quips about the avengers terrible accents too many random characters the film is supposed to be about black widow no but essentially she is nothing burger in this film compared to the other characters so much nonsense forced situations that defy logic the list goes on and on strangely after seeing this film want more of florence pugh she awesome hope she gets more action film roles ', ' oh man the last thing wanted was to be disappointed with this series but it a turkey unworthy of marvel and whedon what is it with token brits in tv series nowadays the accent is wrong and the feel is wrong the dolly birds with attitude are wrong and feel cheesy and agent colson likeable as hell in his movie appearances and perfect as sobering element against the backdrop of mayhem just doesn fit in with the personalities around him just when they seem to be getting super hero movies right they drop the ball with the line wide open m going to persevere with it for now but m struggling m not sure how whedon could view the rushes and be satisfied with the finished product sorry but it a thumbs down from me and now have to get over it if m to enjoy the cinematic marvel offerings ', ' well finally the big one they all come together and assemble iron man hulk thor and captain america come together with hawkeye black widow to take down loki saw this at the cinema not in 3d and really enjoyed it the way put the trailer clips together into story in went completely different way which was glad of enjoyed how they did it and how they brought them together and how they disagree and then find out they need each other there are few twists in this that really wasn expecting the dialogue in this movie absolutely awesome and so funny more jokes and hilarious quips than expected which were really good m glad it wasn really bad and it was the complete opposite as there are no origin stories and it just the avengers even people who haven seen the rest of the mcu think will enjoy it as there isn much depth and lot is explained like why the hulk is why he is and how they found cap alive so with very slight back stories and awesome plot will get this dvd and everyone else needs to too yes right now go http theojreviews blogspot co uk ', ' like others have said before one of the best superhero shows this is as close to batman as marvel gets superhero that is also deeply human conflicted traumatized and flawed applaud all that and then some but just have to give some punisher points because really the psychopath always has to listen to classical music m soo allergic to this by now hate kubrick for starting this trend ', ' season one 10 stars it not jessica jones but it also the best cinematic version of the punisher to date including the 1989 dolph lundgren version which is arguably the best movie version to date now ve seen people on imdb complain about the lack of super powers and the violence involved in the series and well clearly they aren really familiar with the source material especially since the punisher is essentially dexter that is he a serial killer tolerated only because he kills the bad guys but still serial killer and with that in mind you have series about killer that kills lot of killers worse than he is only unlike dexter he killing them with guns and not really concerned about getting caught or the evidence he leaves behind he just killer and well it works it done right and the characters are perfect season two season 1 gave 10 stars season 2 did something so anti punisher that had to bring it down to 1 it did the jessica jones thing the first season was amazing not season 1 of jessica jones good but it nailed the punisher better than even some of the writers in the comics could ever dream of max clearly excluded and then it does the political thing and unfortunately the politics were woke now with jessica jones the kind of politics weren that important they still killed the show but at least the politics fit the character jessica jones iron fist luke cage to an extent you can introduce far left politics and it would fit their character daredevil is defined more by being catholic but even then you can take the character to the left and it would fit just not as far they are all essentially liberal characters but the punisher is not liberal character the punisher can go woke jessica can but the punisher is essentially serial killing super conservative authoritarian he not nice person the punisher is slightly right of atilla the hun he makes trump look like liberal that is the essence of his character he an authoritarian he a conservative character that is his personality he more of neo con than iron man he more conservative than mr fantastic and netflix made him woke it is personality trait that brings him into conflict with so many other marvel characters especially very liberal characters like captain america and realize that woke people are also authoritarian but it an authoritarianism that is the direct opposite of the punisher so not only did they inject politics into my escapism again which hate but this time the politics where in direct contrast to the character personality so congratulations netflix you messed up really good show on two levels injecting politics into show is irritating when you are watching it to escape the bleak reality on the news but when the politics contrast the essence of the character it a tragedy ', ' after being mostly busy during its first two weekends of release finally saw black widow which was looking forward to because m big fan of the character and wanted to see her get proper albeit past tense send off scarlett johansson always does great job playing her love espionage films and the fact that this seemed to be sort of homage to gritty spy thrillers like the jason bourne franchise also had me interested the mcu hasn really done spy movie before although the taut political thriller tone of captain america the winter soldier has some similarities with this film unfortunately was disappointed with the final project the film is serviceable and certainly isn bad but it far too bland and formulaic the plot of the film centers around natasha and her sister yelena very strong florence pugh who were both brainwashed into an assassin program by russian operatives when they were young explained early on by an opening scene and surprisingly quite grim by mcu standards opening credits montage natasha tries to track down their undercover parents that brought them into this world and stop its mastermind dreykov and his masked henchman taskmaster johansson and pugh are always great to watch on screen and are able to convey grit and realism as well as unique chemistry david harbour surprisingly steals the show during his scenes but rachel weisz is sadly underutilized the film doesn really differentiate from the typical mcu formula basically setting up slightly connected internal and external conflict culminating in cgi filled third act action climax what unfortunate here is that the film misses lot of opportunities to further develop natasha as character in contrast to what we know about her from previous mcu films while pugh is good m not sure how much of an integral role she will end up having in the franchise going on the film pacing is fast and kinetic but its story beats and plot tropes feel been there done that enough by the standards of the superhero genre for the pacing to feel less significant to viewers than it normally would dreykov and taskmaster are both very weak and underdeveloped villains some of the jason bourne esque fight scenes are well choreographed but the action doesn really stand out compared to other marvel films while it can be mildly entertaining at times viewers will ask what the broader point was here given the film relatively light character development formulaic tendencies and stakes within the mcu it certainly not bad but it definitely feels like phase 1 mcu movie deficient in the intertextuality and distinctness of some of the more recent marvel adventures and it doesn end up doing much to further develop post endgame mcu recommended only to die hard marvel fans everyone else can wait to rent or stream it 5 10 ', ' loved this movie from start to finish it was so great to see film where the women aren sexualized but instead intelligent strong and meaningful loved the comedic sister character the banter between the two were great also loved that the film made fun of how black widow has been sexualized with her sexy pose strictly put in the past films for one purpose which was totally unnecessary this film called it out so that was great exciting and adventurous has action humor and emotion love ', ' why on earth marvel would ruin the formula that has worked for them to get to the absolute top in the box office success why would they ruin the best female comics movie character to date johansson as black widow was amazing in her role waited for this movie to erase the bad taste of the prey birds from my conscience and extreme disappointment is the proper phrase to describe it black widow has always been sexy version of james bond in fantasy setting she was sexy and incredibly smart to get the info from her enemies and held her own in all of the movies prior to this one what we ve got is lousy woke character who clearly forgot her origins and her means of dealing with obstacles bad everything is this the beginning of the end for avengers franchise seems so added star for scarlett as she one of my favorite actresses all around ', ' if not for tennant fabulous turn as the villain here this review would have been one star agonizingly dull and infinitely pointless script clueless uninteresting characters and boozy nitwit as the title character all combine to make this the worst of the thankfully short lived netflix marvel abortions dreck honestly what more is there to say it stunk it started horribly and apart for one glorious moment when she balled luke cage this show was so boring used to to fall asleep dull dull dull david tennant on the other hand deserves his own show and he should be in every movie ever made the man is utterly brilliant ', ' ve read lot of reviews about this movie and most of them weren good so didn have high hopes for this movie at all but after finishing it it was surprisingly good the acting was good the actions scenes were very well made think the director did really good job ve never heard of her before but she did way better job than the directors of captain marvel scarlett and florence both are amazing in this movie and play off each other well the main villian is ok would say he was amazing but we didn really get to see much of him the other side characters weren all that good either david harbour and rachel weisz are more or less shoved at the sideline this movie is very much similar to the mission impossible saga from the action cinematography and even the music sounds the same which isn a shock considering it the same composer but this seems to work for the film black widow is good it far from one of the best but it was good to see decent send off to black widow feel like this movie is several years too late can believe we got captain marvel before this movie ridiculous 7 10 ', ' first of all what brilliant actor charlie cox is when saw its season 1 was amazed that something can be so dark and good at the same time then season 2 got better and everyone loved daredevil and the punisher and now season 3 is even better its the best superhero tv series in the business right now the writing acting baground score one shot action scenes darkness which makes your heart beating are just brilliant ', ' ve watched this film three times and will likely watch it few more there is always something new to see which is why m finally coming to offer review m tired of the reddit boyz driving down the ratings of good films here is what like about black widow the love story is actually about family type love not sexual type love and that is really refreshing florence pugh is so damn good always though that by fridging natasha endgame made mistake it should have been clint that sacrificed himself and m glad to have just that little bit more of natasha romanov before she departs the mcu forever david harbour is hilarious the door is open to whole bunch of kick ass woman centered spy films which just rocks my boat there more but really you should just go watch the film again cheers ', ' nothing to see here move along irrational plot lines inaccurate gun fights and stupid characters love season 1 not so much season 2 ', ' but hey they are at least thirty movies in before things started to fall apart don want to give ammo to the haters but this movie was not very good at all all the production woes that were reported behind the scenes are readily apparent in the first act this movie not only switches the characters but it switches tone on dime from action to drama to comedy to being friggin musical at one part it jarring and obnoxious the villain played by game zawe ashton does actually have fascinating motivation on paper but she is saddled with cliched villainous dialogue the special effects are not as terrible as the trailers suggest but the movie is visually not that memorable for movie that reportedly cost more than 200m key plot point is that the three main lead actresses switch places with each other for reasons it comes and goes when the plot demands it iman vellani is probably the one cast member who looks happy to be in this movie she is delightful in her cheerful delivery and just being casually upbeat teyonah parris is left with sourpuss characterization that doesn give her room to be her more naturally funny and snarky persona brie larson probably the most hated actress in the mcu is actually more personable as carol danvers compared to her first appearance slj returns as nick fury but he just kind of there to react to things the less said about kamala khan annoying family the better this movie is indicative of all the problems facing the marvel cinematic universe right now it has thin plot poorly directed action and uninteresting characters it just takes cool concept and makes it less cool and that a shame it almost makes me want to apologize to eternals for being so boring instead of bad necessarily almost anyway ', ' did anybody else feel like watching fast and furious but instead of letty it was natasha ', ' even though the plot of marvel movies is pretty much straight forward and not very complicated in all of their movies bad guys doing bad things good guys doing things to stop them this one is just extra boring and too correct in every way marvel movies have used to be fun and entertaining but this one failed to do that the main character is neither cool or charming no sense of humour and no charisma cgi is good as always but story is dull the whole thing feels forced and not very logical not even for superheroes universe ', ' really liked this movie thought it was about time that black widow got her own film and it was bad movie the story was okay and the new introduced characters are likeable and funny the cgi is little bit bad but the action scenes were okay now for the stuff didn like about this movie first off was the villain taskmaster now if you are superhero nerd like am then you know who taskmaster is and how cool he is in this movie they really mess him up by changing his entire character and there isn a lot of suspense as we all know black widow had to live so she can die in endgame so it feels like everything she goes though doesn really matter because we all know she was dead by the time this movie came out overall it was decent movie this movie should have came out before avengers endgame ', ' nothing special and horrid cgi also this is definitely aimed at young teens don know what was expecting given the mediocre trailers watched it not as bad as what if but definitely weak overall ', ' out of all of the marvel shows on netflix the punisher is by far the most graphically violent one in the bunch to further expand on that it is objectively one of the most violent things have ever witnessed on screen have seen the evil dead saving private ryan hacksaw ridge and many other seemingly violent stories non of which come close to the violence embedded in the punsher why is this story more objectively violent it does not stop at moments one would expect it to stop there is handful of scenes where the viewer expects the typical zoom out and fly around then zoom in that goes back and shows the final part of the violence and the aftermath of it instead the camera actually focuses on the violence and draws the viewers closer into it sending shivers down the spines of even the strongest of viewers while most over the top violent story lines either plunder because of their ridiculous violence or rely strictly on the violence to drive the plot the punisher offers something different it instead uses the violence to elevate the plot and captivate the audience every punch gun shot explosion and knife slice draws viewers closer and closer into the story the punisher also utilizes violence to help viewers connect with characters especially frank castle towards the end of the season the brutal violence seems to be encouraged as there is major reason why castle is committing the brutal acts the punisher is petal to the metal character developing show that brings out the sadist in its viewers and leaves jaws on the ground 10 10 easily one of the best shows of the decade ', ' definitely not great movie by any means but it not nearly as bad as people say it is as long as you turn off your brain and just go with the flow there ll certainly be things to appreciate in this movie the fight scenes were actually pretty cool won spoil anything because of some kind of entanglement not fully explained and liked how the three girls used this glitch to their advantage in coordinating their attacks on the big bad character development and depth was definitely an issue story was really shallow and some elements of the movie were just too weird and immature such as the planet of aladna that place really made me cringe m glad they didn spend too long there the flerkens get more to do this time round and they end up being pretty damn useful all in all not great movie but enjoyed it lot more than thought would thought some parts were really creative but there some fundamental problems with the movie for sure ', ' first rated this movie 10 back in 2017 as during that time was still brainwashed under the mcu thought they were prefect movies ll keep avengers 1 as 10 10 instead of giving it 6 10 it great for being movie on this scale it just not near the best movies or superhero movies in terms of story and development back in 2012 was mcu hyped and practically worshiped the mcu and praised movies like avengers 1 at the time in 2012 avengers 1 felt was the greatest thing ever now in 2019 my views on avengers 1 and the mcu has changed completely mcu does not deserve the hype it gets from the general audience and media avengers 1 even for first take was pretty generic where it still has unanswered plot holes avengers 1 is good movie on its own comparison its overrated generally speaking it has brainwashed fans kids fanboys like was was ignorant to the flaws and worshipped an ugly looking movie like avengers 1 once worshipped the mcu like damn fool mcu and the avengers 1 ruins its self with lack of character story development under used villains weak heroes and pointless jokes other than loki hela and thanos all villains are jobbers all the heroes are treated as highly durable in terms of plot device and plot armour recommendation watch this movie for fun while drinking beer or some food with lot of sugar otherwise you may get brainwashed like was in addition if your will power is weak don watch this movie or any mcu movie ', ' marvel agents of h e d is thrilling action adventure

excellent writing pacing and attention to detail ensuring that viewers are always on the edge of their seats the action scenes are expertly choreographed and the acting is top notch making the show must watch for fans of the marvel universe would recommend this show to kids aged 12 13 and up who enjoy thrilling adventures and action packed entertainment the series is perfect for anyone who loves the marvel universe and wants to dive deeper into its rich and exciting world ', ' when first saw who marvel cast as daredevil lost all hope of it being better than the 2003 movie which loved back then and still do but as soon as the first trailer was out realized how mistaken was and couldn wait for it to be released and now love it the directing the acting the story its all top notch love how they balanced his matt murdock persona as lawyer and as vigilante even the supporting characters were all handled pretty greatly vincent was born to play wilson fisk the show had the best fighting sequences ve seen in any superhero show and the fact that its bloody and gory makes it even better marvels daredevil is must watch ', ' this show is religious eslam fobic very much biased show there is no point in making such shows which is never going to be liked by world audience literally felt like looking at some 3rd grade pakistani movie please marvel it would have better if you would have collaborated with bollywood professionals ', ' rarely review any movie titles purely because watch so many films it would be impossible to review them all avengers assemble however was special case not only rate this as the best comic book movie ever crafted but also as one of the best films ever made it had heart comedy action animation character development suspense all neatly encompassed in smooth and flawlessly flowing joss whedon storyline each character has his her moment of glory and not one of the actors actresses feel short of the high expectations placed upon their shoulders chris evans as captain america is and always will be my favourite character in this marvel film series and he shined brighter than ever in his second role reprisal cannot more highly insist you see this film whilst it is in the cinemas in 3d if you possibly can as it adds depth and en chances the cgi especially on the tanked body of the hulk and the none cgi behind of miss scarlett the avengers assembled in perfect form lets bring on the next one ', ' it incredibly unfortunate that this show is being review bombed because its writing storyline and characters are some of if not the best marvel has seen save maybe black panther and even then it a close one the style like the comic that inspired it is geared towards younger audience it framed primarily as teen high school drama but this certainly doesn detract from the storytelling lead iman vellani brings youthfulness and charisma to the role that fully encapsulated the character of kamala fleshing her out in way that is assuredly been lacking in some of the other recent marvel titles save hailee steinfeld performance in hawkeye the show also takes time to talk about the character pakistani origin and muslim faith and the intricacies that these identities would bring for an american superhero though the show pulls its punches compared to the source material to keep the disney esque vibe feige seems to prefer for the mcu and it not hard to imagine that this being shown whatsoever may have inspired some of the unforgiving reviews this happens to be one of less than handful of marvel offerings that has characters rich enough that they could carry an entertaining show even if superpowers never entered the mix the only reason gave this 8 stars instead of 10 is that things resolved little too quickly as the show progressed necessary evil trope within the mcu in order to set the stage for the characters to appear in another title in this case the marvels but this is definitely worth checking out for any mcu fan any high school movie fan and especially kamala khan fan ', ' it has flaws like any shows m not big believer that every show gets 10 or 1 for me though enjoyed the story the action believable or not bernthal is amazing love the intensity he brings to his characters m one of the few who had him as my favorite in the walking dead really hope disney revives the series when the time frame is up and they can bring everyone back lot of stories can be told still to keep the series fresh ', ' hate giving this show any review below an 8 but all can say is watch season 1 appreciate it in all its glory and pretend that they never made season 2 have never seen starker contrast between the quality of content written in each season season 1 amazing character depth character progression and ultimately character enjoyment season 2 complete and completely turning great characters into have begrudgingly pushed through season 2 looking for redeeming quality but feel like just ate 10 lbs of cardboard every episode ', ' not much more on content clearly woke in nature never knew superheros do have religion disney marvel shall also disclose the religion of iron man ant man spider man black widow etc if they care ', ' ms marvel has lot going against it marvel only pg rated story character who isn extremely well know outside the fandom marvel female led tv and much more yet gives viewers great start to new character the cast and crew many times have said that the story is coming of age story for superhero so obviously you expect it to be different than other marvel series the first episode gives us look at kamala khan and bit of her backstory which is major part of her character her family friends values religion and culture all make her unique iman vellani plays the character extremely well and makes us feel as though kamala is exactly one of us marvel fan the small things that we see in the show also represent different parts of kamala upbringing which for many might seem off but in essence create character that represents many cultures highly recommend this being way to get younger audiences started in the mcu if they aren already ', ' as comic fan since the 80s this is great change of pace anyone giving negative reviews are just being childish try for once to separate yourself from your bogus preconceived bs and enjoy the show for what it is fantastic interpretation of the character ', ' the show was well cast and the acting was pretty good also liked the scenes regarding ms marvel family friendship and extended community however the cgi was distractingly awful particularly when attempting to integrate real life vellani with her animated unnatural looking movements if you don have the budget or talent to approximate realism then don do it at all ms marvels powers don give her martial prowess so why try to make that part of her character and then do rubbish job of representing it more importantly the story line is total rubbish and completely incoherent how does plot that fails to move clearly from to and with villains whose actions make absolutely no sense within the context of the show make it into production persevered for four eps because its marvel and m completionist but ultimately gave up judging by what ve heard and read that was the right choice its such shame can forgive poor cgi as understand that not every project has the budget to create epic visuals but good script costs the same to make as bad one and professional screen writers should be able to shape competent story ', ' tempted to leave 10 10 review to counter the ridiculous earlier initial reviews but will leave an honest 9 for this beautifully choreographed expertly edited and very well acted series ', ' don think is chaotic thing is an interesting proposition than turns out entertaining guess people don like when they see something that has lot of women point of view but think that the reason really enjoy wish had the courage to go to the movies when it came out but wasn and saw it and really enjoyed hope you give it chance saw lot of hate to this saga and don get it mean all the worst comments are from man the amount of people working in this film was amazing the story has little bit of all sci fi and comics and cinema all the mcu is also here and it feels sorority in here just hope you that read this give it chance it funny and entertaining and is not that bad ok bye ', ' while the dark knight with christian bale is possibly the best superhero movie of the 21st century this first installment of the group of marvel heroes known as the avengers is decent addition to the canon unlike other groups of superheros such as the fantastic four and the men several of the avengers were previously superheros in their own right in previous incarnations the oldest is captain america who first appeared in the 1940 and fought against the axis powers during world war ii both iron man and the wasp appeared previously in marvel tales to astonish in 1962 and thor appeared first in marvel journey into mystery also in 1962 the hulk like captain america appeared previously in his own comic book in 1962 like the original comic book published in 1963 this film of the avengers has them battling thor adopted and wayward brother loki who are part of race of beings called the asgardians the film begins with american scientists working on strange cube shaped artifact the tesseract which seems to have come from another dimension we later learn it was discovered in the ocean nick fury kind of cia agent superhero in the marvel universe played by samuel jackson heads the operation in secluded compound which would give the pentagon run for its money the tesseract appears to have powers beyond the comprehension of the mere mortals who can stop working on the darn thing of course that doesn stop them from playing with something out of their league sort of the sf equivalent of the rings from the lord of the rings however instead of taming the cube the scientists inadvertently open kind of portal to another dimension the realm of asgard the world where thor hails from and out pops loki replete with grin which would make medusa turn to stone the grin alone let us know from the get go the baddie of the story he also wields magical spear sword thingie which either turns you to mush or makes you one of his zombie minions like boot squashing insects loki makes mince meat out of the operatives and their security hypnotizes few not the least of which turns out to be the green arrow grabs the tesseract and then melts down their entire complex all within less time then it takes to order and receive cup of coffee at your local coffee shop nick fury engages the avenger initiative to bring the members together gradually each of the superheros who will make up the avengers appears each engaged in some sort of situation which defines their character and their abilities thought that each of their situations were enough to let us know who they were and what kind of powers they have without dwelling on it too much eventually iron man captain america the black widow and the hulk are summoned to h e d their headquarters kind of flying aircraft carrier their plan is to capture loki and find the tesseract natasha k the black widow scarlett johansson iron man robert downey jr and captain america chris evans accomplish the first goal relatively easily when loki infiltrates party of the upper crust in stuttgart germany at first he gets whole crowd of germans on their knees until captain america stops the show while on their way back thor comes flying out of the sky from asgard and grabs loki from out from under iron man at first thor and loki have their deep discussion avoiding such topics as the weather then iron man comes back on the scene and he begins battling with thor contending he should stay out of their dilemma captain america interrupts their fight and eventually loki is taken to h e d which appears to be where loki wants to be and thor accompanies them for me this is where the fun really begins when the members come together with their prisoner they appear at odds with one another the iron man out of costume begins kind of rhetorical one up man ship with captain america and the heroes begin taking different sides dr david banner aka the incredible hulk played by mark ruffalo when he isn green sides with iron man while captain america and thor appear to be at odds with everyone although nick fury tries desperately to keep everything civil we begin to learn this is part of loki plan even though he is held captive and yet he seems strangely complacent as if everything is working to his plan from there everything literally begins to unravel great very entertaining installment in the marvel universe of 21st century films all the cast members are terrific but the best and most interesting lines not to mention the most memorable moments are between david banner the hulk and iron man captain america is just how you expect him righteous in the morality department but rather one dimensional in the rhetorical department the only shortcoming thought was the character of nick fury who seemed like he needed few more off color lines like jackson previous character in pulp fiction he seemed just little too straightforward the ending is foreshadowed somewhat in the middle but it all works definitely must for marvel fans ', ' when was slightly younger had many of the publications of dc and marvel but this awful tv series does not manage to capture any aspect of what fondly remember as mysterious and almost magical alternate reality have unfortunately watched few episodes of this and there is so much wrong with daredevil it is hard to be constructive the plots are vague the violence is too much the fights almost identical in each episode silly and over prolonged time wasting male female interactions could go on and on foggy character script are clich and really why is he there the mumbling low voice high voice dialogue of fisk and some other characters does not make daredevil dark and moody just insulting to watch do the creators of daredevil only have teenagers in mind when making this garbage note that all the good reviews are from the teenage demographic probably and appear to have no taste or the tiniest idea of how tv programs should be made who are the scriptwriters where were they educated why are they so lazy and uncreative will they ever get proper job truly an insulting attempt at entertainment wish had never seen it sorry for the negativity guess just feel dismayed when being treated like moron ', ' casting is way out of line they should have taken some one who could get more emotions to the characters casting for ms marvel is the worst casting decision made only next to captain marvel no offense to the actor but she doenst fit to be ms marvel and the show is really boring they could have written it little well iam huge marvel fan and so so disappointed with ms marvel after wanda vision what if falcon and the winter soldier had good hopes for marvel and this turned out to be dampner hope marvel takes wise casting decisions for upcoming series and write them well s liked bale as gorr that one of the best casting decision they have made ', ' it not were near to daredevil krysten acting is really making the show dull she over does it she cannot pull off tuff strong and cool character story line is not as accepted some sense are silly and no logic dialogues are bad taste stunts are really poor even though characters are having powers there is not much shown in the stunts except pulling the lock out direction need to be improved rachael taylor been more suitable for jessica jones role than krysten ritter krysten ritter acting is really not convening for the role don think can continue to watch season 2 hope they come back with more improvement else this show gonna die ', ' the movie is quite solid with awesome chemistry between the family good acting action and great humour scattered throughout it made me want to see more of these characters on the downside there are some cliche lines that are bit annoying and the villain are quite bland unoriginal and un compelling ve heard people complaining that they don like the movie as it doesn feel necessary which kind of makes sense but why does it need to be just enjoy it for what it is would definitely still recommend seeing this ', ' first time marvel created some cheap level family drama series like watching sas bahi drama really disappointed doesn expect this from marvel bollywood songs in background come on ', ' was really excited for this series especially after we had seen what netflix and marvel can do together honestly thought that jessica jones will be better than daredevil and the flash but was so wrong but as any other show it has positives and negatives what really liked is performance krysten ritter gave us she was just amazing as cynical hopeless and mostly drunk i who really likes sex and doesn give sh also the other thing liked was david tennant as kilgrave who was great character and had great backstory and chemistry with jessica their war through out the season is the thing that kept me watching besides 2 of them luke cage and trish walker were great now there are so many things didn like so ll put them all together subplots and side characters 5 characters and 5 subplots malcolm drug problem jeri divorce problem hope prison problem will super drug problem and robyn brother problem were just uninteresting and poorly thrown into the show and robyn is the worst all together it meh the premise and the center of the show revolving around jessica and kilgrave is amazing but subplots take down that greatness right away making this show slow burn of boringness considering this is netflix marvel product am underwhelmed by this show and am not looking forward season 2 ', ' this was the 4th movie saw in theater since the pandemic began and it was the only one actually enjoyed thanks marvel we ve missed you although packed with cgi and unrealistic chasing fighting scenes typical of marvel movies it tone is more of spy movie like 007 or bourne than super hero movie and that was good change of pace agree with some reviewers that amid the whole mcu saga it may feel pointless since it almost doesn connect to anything the post credit scene being most important in that aspect than the whole movie and the character is already dead presently so it may feel hard to really care about the story but as stand alone action spy movie it works pretty well ', ' the cast is too annoying the made up accent by the mother is the most irritating part of the series bad writing and way too boring don even bother to watch it marvel took an with this one ', ' some younger people might like this because they have become accustomed to yugioh dragonball and other japanime type shows where everyone announces their move and power levels in every attack move well here it is again with an avengers skin thrown on it so yeah some kid shows can be quiet entertaining especially even okay written one with marvel or dc heroes this one is still best left 7 year old and younger and or maybe really introverted 12 and under but beyond that unless you are intentionally trying to drive people out of the room avoid this one ', ' loved the idea of black widow but the storyline just didn work for me the action was great and in this scarlett johansson was terrific unfortunate that the plot was unclear at times ', ' this series is so painfully slow hitchcock once said drama is life with the dull bits cut out think someone got it the wrong way around here there is scene lasting almost six minutes into the episode that consists of woman coming home having drink having shower going to bed having dream waking up getting dressed and going to work padding anybody we see similar and lengthy scene of wilson if talk really slowly we can drag this out to full season fisk getting up and dressed and eating breakfast yeah riveting stuff guys as for our action hero this is guy who apparently has been training in martial arts and honing his powers since he was child yet somehow manages to drag out every fight into an interminably boring darkly orange lit nightmare in which most of the time he gets his butt kicked almost to death by nearly every crook he comes across but that okay because though it never mentioned he has the recuperative powers of wolverine the character should that be cartoon character of foggy is the most annoying moron one could meet he is there to carry more script padding as hardly anything he ever says contributes in any way to what little story there is as two hour movie sans all the padding this could have been ok but trying to stretch that to 13 hours of which daredevil appears for probably less than an hour has left us with tediously monotonous pile of garbage that everybody thinks is great but as we know popularity rarely equates to quality the number of people using the internet while watching television is on the rise with new study showing that 40 per cent of 18 24 year old browse social networking sites while watching tv consequently program makers are producing many shows that can be viewed this way without any loss to enjoyment daredevil is perfect example just look up for the loud bits ', ' upon watching trailers and other promotional material for the series thought was going to really dislike it however was surprised by the first episode it reminded me of the comedy show kim convenience with the funny father and more serious mother this first episode undoubtedly has problems but it was not terrible iman does an amazing job as kamala can say m looking forward to the rest of the series and to all those review bombing the series just because it is not as dark and broody as the likes of moonknight or dr strange in the multiverse of madness does not make it bad it was refreshing change of pace for the mcu ', ' this film is so incredibly nonsensical devoid of logic and coherence it was pain to watch it can we make up our mind are black widows humans or captain americas or is it only when plot armour kicks in it does not help that writers probably didn watch any of the previous mcu films what was that nonsensical after credit scene how is hawkeye responsible for natasha death avoid like fire do something better with these two hours don know pick up knitting anything but this ah and what is with that condescending treatment of men projecting much why did the film try to make clown out of the red guardian ', ' well done tying to next marvel series note easy to be critic behind keyboard difficult to be creator ', ' frankly was hyped as hell for this series couldn wait to see it and had high hopes that it would be great bud sadly was left disappointed at the end of the first season had no problem for the dark look of the series and the flashback sequences blended in nicely with the story but it does not make up for the errors in the script that many times main and supporting characters act out of their characters the best thing of the show was the introduction and the development of the evil characters in the series it does great job at this so great job that you will like the bad guys more then the pathetic main character and the even more pathetic and idiotic sidekicks so the worst part is when you see the character that you can identify with the most in it downfall and m talking about the main villain not the self righteous vigilante who will play with your nerves in the end the final conclusion is that it worth to watch if you don have anything better to do and don expect to be hyped for season two you won ', ' what can say about the avengers that everyone else hasn already said well believe the hype it great why well numerous reasons one of them is the director they chose for the job of bringing one of the most iconic super teams in comics to life joss whedon has showed time and time again that he knows about both the marvel universe see his run on astonishing men and team dynamics see firefly or any of his other works and he works his magic to the max here another reason is the great cast while all good two performances really stand out to me the first one is mark ruffalo as bruce banner hulk and the second one is tom hiddleston as loki while enjoyed ed norton banner felt something was missing from him likability mark ruffalo had likability tom hiddleston loki was great villain that really had that sinister aura about him and he better here than he was in thor another reason is the action not only does the final scene have an epic battle that rivals robots trashing chicago in transformers 3 this is way cooler but other great action scenes come throughout the movie one of my favorites is the scene at the beginning where loki steals the tesseract cosmic cube and takes down whole bunch of h e d agents including nick fury and hawkeye also the plot is fairly simplistic but what really makes this movie shone is the character dynamics so final verdict possibly the best movie of the summer of 2012 assemble and go see it ', ' all of the netflix marvel shows have been great but this one is the best the writing and script is great and jon bernthal acting is perfect he is easily the most convincing punisher by far and thomas jane was great himself know they will prob cancel it along with all their rest but some of the best shows have been cancelled early and this one was great while it lasted ', ' enough said the first episode is literally montage the likes of which used to be described as lazy and profit seeking disney will probably block this review though ', ' this is not marvel show for adults in fact it has no marvel feeling at all it does however have disney feeling and should have been published under the disney brand this is not made for the marvel audience if it was disney dropped the ball on this one hope the she hulk will be marvel show and save the brand ', ' excellent work done by marvel in showcasing ethnic diversity but they could have worked more on improving the story line even the quality of special effects in action sequences look cheap though time travel sequence in which they showed india pakistan partition was well crafted but this series could have been much better ', ' am dc fan and like this movie it a great feamle superhero movie brie larson and samuel jackson was awesome the action scenes are great cgi is so good and goose is the coolest cat in the world ', ' am disappointed by this movie too many action scenes and fake emotional ones poor humour also there is again the old story of bad russia and good usa and thought the cold war is over russian accents are ridiculous and fake even to me and am not russian mean no russian would ever pronounce jelena and natasha as they did in movie the list is endless expect the rating to fall around 5 as the time is passing by perhaps it is still ok for the audience who is bellow 15 years old but then again for them it too much violence so not sure for whom is this movie made then good point like that it is filmed on different locations and that is unique opportunity to see glimpse of those for people who don get the chance to travel also actresses are handsome ', ' this movie is the worst have seen in the last 12 months and worst of all marvel movies the main character is boring and dull and has no acting skills at no stage in the movie you feel sympathetic for the main actress and since she is overpowered there never is any real threat hopefully she does not get lot of screen time in endgame otherwise it will ruin the movie save your time and money ', ' your typical modern action movie all style no substance plot is close to non existent or at least incomprehensible very jumbled entirely because the writers wanted to somehow meld all the individual avenger stories into one story makes for contrived mess as expected the special effects and action sequences are good hard to compliment performances in an action movie as there is very little real acting involved however robert downey jr puts in show stealing performance on the whole vastly over rated and this is probably sign of how dumbed down the general population is with regard to expectations for movies the only positive thing can say is it better than transformers but that says very little ', ' never spoilers find giving away the plot to guide users juvenile hot take pros was looking for refreshing action movie thrilling action fun acting from rachel wiesz cons bit rehashed should ve come out after civil war rachel accent comes out when she hunches in the movie review after year of half cooked mediocre releases this movie was honestly refreshing have been an avid comic reader since the nineties have had my share of grievances with mcu but compared to dc much less such as there are no mutants no wonderman and quicksilver died too soon no reed richards no magneto and mcu ruined i and mandarin in single movie but digress great movie all around as comic reader always wanted and wondered what heli jumps and widows signature free running would look in live action amazing not disappointed at all but is it worth re watch maybe its not groundbreaking in any shape or form free of any brow beating hollywood representation agenda after thoughts taskmaster is an awol shield agent in the comics the entire shtick of taskmaster is that he is freelance trainer of goons for underground organizations he learns from superheroes and teaches it to goons for cold hard cash shield lets him do it so they can keep tabs on how much the underground knows 3 users voted down my post when had only put the disclaimer review coming tomorrow nice ', ' in way it felt like most of marvel superhero films up until 2012 with the exception of iron man were in part build up to an eventual avengers film this mainly being down to little details or minor plot points spread throughout the films so with all this build up lot was riding on avengers assemble providing what was expected d say that avengers assemble succeeds on star power alone when you ve waited for so long to see so many icon heroes all on screen together and when you have such an entertaining cast pulling the strings it hard not to get carried away with enjoyment it certainly has its problems but as far as sheer entertainment is concerned it prospers story norse god loki returns to earth and steals tesseract from shield which he plans to use to open portal and bring an alien army to take over the world head of shield nick fury initiates plan to form superhero team made up of those he previously contacted and they become the only hope in stopping the invasion as far as the plot is concerned it is equally absurd and predictable there no big twists and lot of it does stick to some already well worn clich with that said it is blast to see all the heroes together at last there squabbles are frequently very funny and seeing them fighting side by side always is exciting heroes the film manages to balance out all the big personalities rather well yet there are two standouts robert downey jr is once again magnetic and hilarious screen presence offering many brilliant lines and that well placed sardonic attitude mark ruffalo is simply fantastic as an awkward and edgy bruce banner balancing out all aspects of the character excellently and as the hulk he manages to get some unexpected laughs though both underused chris evans is solid as the stern captain america and chris hemsworth gets enough to do as slightly more conflicted thor villains tom hiddleston returns as loki and brings more energy to the role than previously loki certainly seems more weary and ruthless than before which works well in making him seem like major threat while hiddleston manages to makes the character even more volatile and his delivery makes each line imposing support black widow and hawkeye act more as back up to the team with both being decent enough scarlett johansson looks fantastic in the part and convinces as an all action heroine but she struggles with some of the weightier dialogue jeremy renner is simply okay as expert archer hawkeye and he does look the part but he is given little development and comes off as bit boring samuel jackson is great as usual with more to do this time around as fury always believable as commanding presence and giving the dialogue spark action the action sequences are all very entertaining in larger than life kind of way the avengers physically fight amongst themselves with the fights between the hulk and thor being as well as the hulk and iron man being lot of fun the large scale fight on the aircraft carrier is exciting as well as varied and it nice to see all the avengers in battle the climax is as extravagant as you would expect with lots of immense action set pieces and it is thrilling to see all the characters work together though it definitely drags on little too much and at times feels like action overload music alan silvestri provides an effective and suitably upbeat score the main theme itself is simply superb in managing to create sense of importance and excitement elsewhere silvestri gives the action scenes pounding backdrop and crafts some good melodies production on certain level joss whedon does successful job given the amount of work he had to do fitting in all the characters and making it work he knows how to keep the action gripping and when to simply give the actors some room to breathe while the visuals are injected with enough style and energy to make it work on the other hand don think the dialogue is that great unless its downey jr saying it or it used for comedic purposes most of the important lines feel forced simplified or just clich which is credit to the actors for making it plausible think that most of the problems lie with the story in that it too straight forward as to what going to happen and how thing will pan out of course this lets the characters drive the plot bit more yet many of them just aren given sufficient things to do there is definitely an over reliance on cgi here as well though you expect that given the massive action scenes and most of it looks good it does take you out of the film and that is very apparent during the climax conclusion on purely entertainment based scale avengers assemble succeeds thanks to sheer excitement big thrills and funny interactions between our heroes the lighter tone works greatly in the films favour while we also have plenty of cool fight scenes an enjoyable villain and good performances especially those of downey jr and ruffalo however once you start thinking about the plot it the predictability that harms the film and d have enjoyed more risks even if they weren fully realised whilst there is too much action on the whole so at surface level avengers assemble is easy to enjoy and have fun watching just don think about it for too long ', ' really sorry to see this doing poorly at the box office as it will likely end the stories of these characters not sure why either while it not my all time favorite the characters have depth the acting is good the story is interesting the action is good it got another relatable antagonist you get why they are doing what they are doing even if you don agree with it and it just fun movie to all those who worked hard on it you deserved for it to do better for those who haven seen it give it chance these characters deserve place in the mcu and the actresses do good job of bringing them to life ', ' just completed watching the first season this past week and have to say was bit disappointed since was bit hyped after very successful daredevil show and thought this was on the same boat it wasn decent show but completely overrated in its current rating and place in the top 250 for flaws d state its slow pace useless characters cringe worthy dialog and just underwhelming story lines some of the characters just seem completely miscast whilst some of the actors do an amazing job so it evens out on that regard more so the show just feels bland and cheap on the overall setting and then highly contrasted that with unnecessary and gratuitous shock value for no real reason remain hopeful that it improves with further seasons and it is still worth the watch if you some hours to fill but right now it not that great so don expect much which was probably my problem high expectations not met ', ' knew the reign of superhero movies would come to an end but didn think the first brick to fall would be black widow the quality of the captain marvel movie may be an unexpected problem because that character is so powerful but black widow no no she has world of potential to explore but what just watched could really be thrown in the trash right away the action scenes are acceptable by marvel standards but the plot is really bad is natasha the main character or not don see anything to prove that how does she change throughout the film nothing oh know that her hair color the music is so annoying the supporting characters appear like scarecrows it really sad that the studio treats natasha like that bland sexualized uninteresting if only had the rights to edit the script would have yelena and natasha talk about garden she likes somewhere in the middle of the movie corresponding to where natasha tombstone is placed at the end of the movie ', ' the movie is more like compilation of different scenes from unrelated flop movies which has unenthusiastic actors but only one exception is pugh though somehow her character and the way she presented it to the screen is outperforming all the other things in the movie anyway is black widow can be seen in the movie or have to use some kind of special goggles ', ' people don seem to realize that this is comic book movie do the people posting bad reviews even read the actual source material these movies are based on read tons of old comics and seeing kree warriors in their battle armor just like in fantastic four annual 18 was mind bogglingly awesome so was seeing live action skrulls done right brie larson acting was perfect she been living on an alien planet for 6 years do you really expect her to act like normal person the character development was constant with lots of little moments throughout showing character interaction the humor was in classic mcu fashion plenty of cheap laughs some subtly funny stuff but the tone flowed easily from joking back to serious when the plot demanded it the action scenes are intense yet predictable enough to feel comfortable the plot twists that did happen were unexpected for me and my comic book loving friends but we all loved the movie adaptation of the source material it goes without saying that the special effects are absolutely phenomenal even in lower budget mcu film like this the cgi compositing visual effects foley etc are all there and are way better than the majority of movies coming out today the de aging blew my mind there was only one small scene where it looked off but overall it was literally perfect if someone is unironically bashing this film they re either not serious comic book reader or they ve got some kind of weird bias against comic book movies brie larson or strong women for one loved it and will be seeing it again very very soon ', ' the first punisher movie was good with the violence but the actor lacked the charisma to pull it off the second movie the actor was great but the violence was more toned down the punisher is all about punishing the tv show was nice blend of the two didn think that the new castle would be able to pull it off because wasn a fan of his in the walking dead he did decent job guess they were hoping to have some overlaps in shows by having characters from this show also appear in the other marvel shows but ehhh think they could have skipped them can see cancelling jessica jones because it wasn that interesting canceling the punisher was bad choice imo they should have cancelled iron fist out of all the marvel tv shows on netflix iron fist is the worst the punisher should have stayed and iron fist and jessica jones should have gone but it seems that they were all destined to be cancelled maybe marvel wants to do their own thing ', ' ms marvel is probably my favorite disney show so far although many people are upset that kamala powers got changed it still an amazing show which finds way to take the chaos and humor directly from the comics and into the mcu ms marvel target audience is young teens and poc so many of the older generation of marvel fans won find it as entertaining as and many others did but that doesn mean this isn an amazing show with perfect cast and highly recommend it even if you re not in the targeted age group ', ' having watched every mcu film can say with confidence that captain marvel is great film it exploration of new themes and strong female lead is brilliantly refreshing making it very enjoyable to watch whilst the story moves fast the pacing isn excessive overall it a well balanced film that easily in my top 3 marvel films to date ', ' it not for everyone started watching it without any expectations and actually enjoyed the first episode the graphics and camera work is really good the music is great and the actors are awesome find some lines little bit cringy but overall it goid ', ' enjoyed it 14 year old did 12 year old did 8 year old did all left wanting more and interested to see where this series went visual effects for weaving characters text messages into the scenery were really cool ', ' my kids 10 and 7 liked it although they got fidgety during some of the long over drawn out conversation sequences thought it was pretty dumb grew up with comic books and still read them but all these live action films just fall flat first of captain america costume is ridiculous looks like something from the movies of 20 years ago cheap materials galore m really surprised to see so many favorable reviews of this movie the comic lines in the film mostly by tony stark are the cheeziest bunch of dad jokes ve heard the action scenes are good for the most part but again in today society someone dressed up like captain america would look like raving lunatic ', ' black widow is an unnecessary film and everyone who has watched avengers endgame knows why despite being flawed by weak plot that relies heavily on its action sequences it suceeds albeit not much when the relationships between the main characters take the spotlight the film starts great with dark undertone but it rapidly turns into very formulaic story with forgettable antagonist and heavy action packed third act that leaves the viewer with nothing more than sense of disappointment ', ' more often than not when you hear that movie is doing reshoots and has to push back the release date you know it a terrible movie and the producers know it too such is the case with the marvels no amount of reshoots or release delays can save movie with bad script and what never ceases to amaze me is that even though movie is clearly bad like say when it bombs in theaters there are still tons of people giving this movie high ratings hollywood has gotten to the point where it churns out so many bad movies that m actually shocked when something is good the previous film captain marvel wasnt too bad so it doesnt make whole lot of sense why the marvels is so far off the mark find iman vellani character so annoying and that another point want to make why would you make movie with characters from tv show that so many people did not like it a recipe for disaster and this was 200 million dollar disaster ', ' m liking this new daredevil series it decently written the production values are high all is well except now and then when the camera work is wiggly at the wrong time that camera wiggling is enough to break audience attention and mess it all up yes hand held camera work saves time money but it can also ruin scene project hope they figure this out soon hate camera ruined scenes ve said all want to say about this tv series now m filling up the space ve been told must if want to submit my thoughts about daredevil not cool fascistic at least the rule that one must tender at least 10 lines is bogus wrong bad users should be able to submit any size review they choose beep the fascist controllers ', ' they could have spent the budget on curing cancer for kids or something useful this is just big waste of money on series would not be suprised if this is canceled before 2nd season shocked if it actually makes second season ', ' wanted so bad to like this series joss whedon has made us nerds so happy all these years avengers firefly alien resurrection even toy story he had his misses too but this isn just about joss samuel jackson appeared as nick fury the main agents that we all liked in the film were making cameos and led by the teddy bear character that we all came to know in the previous marvel films leading up to the avenger movie the series started well in the first two episodes however the third was sharp cliff where the series fell off and did not quite seem to recover from hope other people enjoy this show and wish could but that is not the case wish you all the best thanks ', ' started watching season two still don understand why the title character behaves in manner that is so dysfunctional allegedly she has powers she is able to help people but instead continues to harm herself she is strong but not hulk thor cage etc strong she has vulnerabilities mentally and physically and she is so far not the sharpest tool in the shed still don get it can someone explain the appeal ', ' okay you ve read the headline season two was okay as far as background stories go but season three is really taking the sister sister relationship drama that caused s2 to drag to whole new level of unnecessary and boring by episode 3 or s3 you ll literally be asking yourself is this actually going anywhere anywhere at all and how many flashbacks to the same scene can we possibly be shown and you still haven been shown super villain plus the character of hogarth who was amazing in s1 has become mere filler by s3 occupying each unfulfilling episode like some sort of ghost the producers clearly feel obligated to show for no other reason than that she gay if this were show about gay people relationships and not superhero show it might be an interesting drama about hoharth personal intimacy hangups but it serves zero purpose in furthering the story arc in the jessica jones series the main character is jessica and every time the story jumps tracks to follow hogarth it needlessly protracts and muddles an already boring series ', ' not usually fan of comic book adaptations so started to watch this show just because didn have anything else to watch and wow what nice surprise its just awesome cant stop watching very well scripted great character development just love how realistic it is not like most of comic book shows when you clearly see its for children just effects and no story and character but not this one great work guys and jon bernthal is just awesome as the punisher hope to see more seasons if you like drama action well scripted stuff great acting watch it you wont regret it ', ' was expecting typical cgi infused avenger movie and it certainly is that black widow though has lot in common with james bond movies there even scene in which 007 is playing on tv the black widow must stop russian general called dreykov sort of spectre czar megalomaniac who rescues unwanted girls and turns them into super assassins called widows widows go through extensive training select few get chosen the rest are killed this makes dreykov monstrous misogynist in movie directed by woman cate shortland which has unmistakable feminist themes there are two main black widows scarlett johansson character and yelena belova played by florence pugh belova is impulsive where romanoff is introspective the two are sisters only in that they grew up as part of russian cell in an ohio suburb along with rachel weisz as their brilliant scientist mother and david harbour as red guardian russia version of captain america as the dad the action set pieces and fight scenes were good but no better or worse than your typical marvel avenger movie there are the standard wisecracks as johansson and pugh riff on each other yelena teases natasha signature landing move with one arm extended behind the other hand on the floor and legs spread apart fighting stance yelena finds diva like and pretentious and is disgusted with herself when performing the same pose the chemistry between scarlett johansson and florence pugh is nimble and enjoyable the scenes with david harbour arm wrestling people in gulag prison are also very funny in summary this is solid fun marvel movie with hint we will be seeing more of black widow yelena belova ', ' this is by far marvel most uneven movie from acting to script and action it may feed the stomach but leaves the soul empty while marvel has struggled since endgame there have been some very good entries with infinity powerful heroes something special had to challenge them so some random person with no developed back story or motive is underwhelming while the acting overall was strong these are good actors after all the script was noticeably shocking while marvel has recently embraced the silly it is poorly contrasted with sharp moments the attempted to be emotional and forced moments of drama while the action is fine the shtick of their power switching is so forced and has no impact on the plot character development and lends no lasting impact more like the soft buzz of fly in the background you find obnoxious than the the loud roar of creativity this movie has all the hallmarks of an nfl team down by 21 with 3 minutes left throwing crazy 50 yard touchdown to make it 14 point game cool in the moment but overall utterly insignificant 5 10 ', ' think that this show was nice obviously it is more targeted towards teenagers and see why older mcu fans are not particularly fond of it ms marvel is light hearted and funny really liked how they developed the backstory of khan family and have appreciated the flashbacks set during the partition iman vellani is perfect and she gave lot of personality to this character hope to see her in more challenging roles in the future but for now she left good impression the rest of the cast is composed for the most part by talented actors this show reminded me of the disney channel original movies that were aired in the first 00s with which grew up therefore it was nice jump into the memory lane liked the colorful mood of the show the editing is really creative with some animation elements appearing once in while that made this series refreshing and bit different did not like the cgi which looks cheap and unfinished under this department it needed to be refined bit for sure this is far away from being the best marvel product but personally don get all the hate that it is getting all over the internet it is good and balanced origin story that deepens bit the pakistani culture as well looking forward to seeing this character in the marvels ', ' he is frank castle his work in this is better than just about anything on tv his range of emotion and the way he gets this character is something you don see everyday the violence in this show is background noise compared to the story the only thing that would be better is if they crossed him over to the mcu billy russo is great as well there an honesty to the performance on both parts that gets you hooked daredevil season three was the best marvel adaptation thus far but this is tie in many regards just hope they keep this around unlike daredevil ', ' think need to make the same promise to myself as did with dc movies it time to move on and stop watching these the absurdity is out of control wasn actually going to see this last movie from marvel given the poor reviews but ve seen all marvel cinematic universe content so far so gave in the question is why did do this first let me share this in the hopes marvel creators see it any dramatic charge you try to add to these movies will not work if you mix these attempts at comedy that serve only to ridicularize whatever is taking place in film that already poorly written it not the fact that the jokes are always the same boring type it they make the movie superficial and any suspense or sense of danger goes out the window the characters are so one dimensional it hurts admit that kind of enjoyed captain marvel first movie but she is an under explored character she is constantly somewhere doing something and we never get to really know her motivations they don even bother now to give any sort of explanation to anyone power it a free for all there are more people with some sort of super ability than regular people and they get these powers in such random and nonsensical fashion it laughable and what on earth was that musical scene it was so cringe almost had to fast forward know it hard to produce good content after the success of the last avengers movies but are the people working at marvel just keep pushing bad movies with bad cgi and the same old story to earn some bucks in the hopes another multi super hero saga catches on again people need to send message and stop supporting this content at least the ones who feel the same way ', ' good little scifi show dull at times good at other times nice plot twists to look forward to acting is great ', ' it is very boring and slow show after all the probsgabda around it agonized my self watching season 1 just in case and it was big waste of time and data package events are not convincing jessica urge to save hope while many other people are getting killed is not even understandable if you are bored have time plenty of it then enjoy ', ' boring cringey the standards of marvel have come down horribly watch tom jerry instead the dialogues are so annoying the acting is third rate with the kind of money that marvel has it couldn afford worthy actress lol ', ' every rating on here gets an automatic 2 stars because this takes place in the mcu this includes my rating this movie is mess sure the action scenes are fun but when did marvel movie make you slap your forehead like fast and furious movie come on man m all about powerful female characters and to be honest they were great but the male characters are useless boring and pathetic this approach was unnecessary empower the women but do so with some taste ', ' so many people here seems so disappointed but can say that m glad m enjoyed this one especially because of florence pugh performance ', ' if you want to represent pakistani community then you should use pakistani songs not indian someone said it for child they are not wrong it is for childs ', ' marvel should stick to what it does best which is not making cringy pakistani themed marvel series ms marvel was disappointment from the beginning ', ' so yeah am older than kid saw 2 episodes but even know its for kids the story is about nothing just alot of air and no substance dialogues are about nothing just very uninteresting conversations even right after seeing 2 episodes am still wandering reflecting what its about its not funny unless your 13 maybe and your sence of humor is still undeveloped effects are on kids level too no exitement no nailbiting action can not even imagine would like it when would be 13 will for sure not continue to watch and for me its 1 becasue its in color ', ' so disney think they can make terrible movie and the audience will just feel sympathy for the already dead character think again disney this is huge disappointment and feels nothing like marvel movie ', ' me and my son thought captain marvel was great definitely worth seeing ', ' this show makes you watch with smile on your face it shows lot of great aspects of kamala life personally give this show nine but only rated it ten to try to counteract this awful review bombing it a great show and most definitely worth watch ', ' teyonah parris as monica rambeau iman vellani as kamala khan and brie larson as carol danvers star in dacosta picture the three characters genuine friendship makes for lively and engaging encounter the marvels expands on captain marvel predecessor by delving deeper into themes of sisterhood and interplanetary reliance written by dacosta karasik and mcdonnell the movie delves into the intricate geopolitical and familial underpinnings of captain marvel striving to transcend existentialism the plot of the marvels has some sudden endings and dropped connections making it rather perplexing the narrative starts in jersey city with missing bangle discovered by kree named dar benn wearing it kamala the young protagonist of ms marvel works on her fan writing about captain marvel dacosta choreography and visual aesthetic are highlighted in the marvels through storyline centered on the acquisition of dar benn kamala connection with carol and monica and their use of their powers v rit technique reminiscent of candyman and angular shifts are used to create the intimate mood of the picture joined by destiny carol monica and kamala have to stop dar benn scheme from happening to the cosmos when it comes to their task the stakes are not as high as they may be the length of time it takes to learn dar benn motivations and the way that plot point is dropped in favor of neat resolution are two issues with the marvels the bond between captain marvel carol and kamala is depicted in the marvels with goose and fury captain marvel leads solitary existence as carol works to piece together her past carol falls toward weakness and loses her steeliness as their interconnecting talents require regular engagement khan shows herself to be the key to this dynamic trio success as the three ladies battle to save their galaxy she encourages carol to loosen up and assists monica in brainstorming she is unquestionably fierce and if disney and marvel are astute she will lead the franchise into the future ', ' one of the best movies of 2012 it also one of the best superheroes films ever besides batman begins the dark knight and iron man one of the most intriguing elements of the movie is that you got combination of superheroes fighting together there are innovative visual effects that demonstrate how realistic the film is to comic book fans and movie goers in addition to that you got good humor that sure to make you laugh good acting and good build up with an awesome climax this movie is an amazing experience and definitely worth seeing it twice in theaters also buy the blu ray you will be delighted trust me ', ' watched season one and no longer to watch left season jessica character wasn powerful and didn take decision in some situations ', ' went to sneak of avengers tonight in austin and wish hadn wasted the couple hours or so very disappointing wish had sold or given away the passes remember time where the story was the most important part of the movie instead of just smart quips and cgi explosions to make up for it guess it is all about making quick buck hey lets put all these elements together and make killing off the rubes thing is we will accept lower and lower quality films and have no one to blame but ourselves don like silly cars that turn into metallic aliens anyone would wait for hbo or the like if you must see this on very related subject who are the morons in marketing who decided that they should over book sneak so good third of passes are turned away from the angry disappointed faces on the adults and kids who were leaving am wondering how all the bad will generated helps promote film they should barely over book by say 1 so that people with lives aren at the mercy of slackers who sit around all day with nothing else going on but to sit all day grade for movie and promotion ', ' awful acting incredibly boring unnecessary pc ness at every second of the film it is trying so hard to be funny but all feel is cringe the actor who plays kamala is simply untalented and annoyingly bad at playing any scene simple truly horrible piece of garbage like the old series on disney channel ', ' this is okay movie ok action ok story but taskmaster ruined taskmaster characters is disaster mean he is worst villains in marvel ', ' although this show is in deed for the younger audience as many people are saying don have problem with that also changing kamalas powers won be problem cause marvel has always been doing that not only with powers but also with costumes and back stories in conclusion as comic fan think that my younger self can relate to this show since wanted to be superhero as kid think that will enjoy this show very much ', ' hi all really liked season 1 5 of the show and started watching season 6 yesterday they hit it out of the park great story if they keep this up it will be the best sci fi show love it ', ' gave this two for the possibility that there is movie have seen in theater that is worse and have forgotten it within first 15 minutes you know this isn making much sense and it goes downhill from there no consistent plot everything just thrown in as if an afterthought would give examples of how insultingly horrible and boring this was but guess would be spoiler and want to help others out there not waste hours and money watching what was more boring than my corporate law class so bad companion and couldn help laughing uncontrollably through much of second half bill hurt how could you let yourself be in this almost s very much enjoyed ironman so it not that can get into comic book movie ', ' waited while for this movie and enjoyed it felt the cast was great and felt it was satisfying end to black widow story ', ' its shame what could be great show is just made very weak in the final season have never witnessed the gaycard played this much in show and watched all episodes of will and grace it feels like every scene has something gay in it dont get me wrong have nothing against gay or trans people live and let live but this final season really pushed it if you want to make point there are better ways not by ruining an entire show ', ' marvel tried well in first 2 episodes and then they completely lost it no storyline whatsoever terrible acting incorrect factual representation of partition and cringe action scenes d prefer watching some cringy bollywood movie liek heropanti or race3 instead of this show ', ' one of the low tier marvel films tbh what can you expect though the black widow is not true hero in my honest opinion so this is just another basic spy espionage plot it also cheaper to do these kinds of films and not incorporate lot of cgi so understand the financial factors and profit margins pretty conventional story though on positive note this film is definitely better than morbius the fantastic four 2015 men dark phoenix the new mutants and the eternals possibly black panther as well that film was just mess the movie wasn worth going to the theaters for like did out of boredom and an excuse to go out but it might be worth watching at home if you have absolutely nothing else to pass the time with ', ' now there a superhero other than those of other faiths however politically correct this may be the actors are unknown have no charisma while the story is off to boring start don waste your time watching this disney is out to please the woke crowd ', ' this was great movie it was funny had heart had awesome visuals everything you would expect from marvel movie ', ' this show was never intended to be big marvel hit instead it speaks to its intended audience and gives different demographic than what is usually pandered to an opportunity to see themselves represented in the screen it also fun funny and has me waiting each week for the next episode and m middle aged white dude ', ' liked it without giving anything away ms marvel although night light is better in my opinion is child teen 12a series that while only having seen the first two episodes has me wanting more it not the best and it not without its flaws but it a nice introduction to young super hero that doesn have all if any of the answers it shows character development imperfect people and mystery sub plot is fairly standard and casting is really well done even the unlikable characters have likable traits which is always refreashing it not perfect but find it hard to find faults the blatent cgi costumed moments are little irking find myself thinking certain messages diolog as stupid having said that should these be adressed could see myself returning for another reveiw for that extra star it rare enough bother reveiwing anything tldr give it go ', ' ms marvel was great it has some issues with plot convenience easy resolutions plot points that feel like they should cause issues for characters just don or get fixed far too easy it not some award winning serious drama it a fun action show with primary demographic of younger adults that aren white males and that why it great her family is great could watch them in any number of comedy shows the best parts of the show really aren about being superhero but seeing brown girl and her family her culture and it hugely creative some of the creativity was only in 1 or 2 episodes would have been great to see it all throughout but that a high expectation really would double or triple the budget workload really good music as well ', ' saw the avengers with no real knowledge of the comic book series or any of the characters beforehand however it took me only 10 minutes of reading imdb reviews to realise that the waters are clearly divided between avengers fans and dark knight fans for me was disappointed after seeing the avengers however can largely attribute that to my backgrounds in reading understanding and writing about complex ideas something christopher nolan films have drawn out of me with that said though the avengers is different kind of comic book film if you re looking for fun action based movie for kids then the avengers is for you however if you have desires for films with grand ideas deep characters and complex plots as well as the batman factor then the dark knight rises is definitely for you one thing is certain though you cannot compare both films against each other joss whedon uses the core elements of the comic series that brought out very michael bay representation while chrisopher nolan transforms the comic book ideas into grander social commentaries on moral and philosophical issues while still giving the dark knight the attention it deserves found the avengers to be typical clich heroes win predictable static film something which really takes the sting out of film for me sat through the film realising that the avengers would come through and win by the way the film was constructed with the dark knight no one could have predicted the jokers complex schemes involving harvey dent and the way that batman still beat the joker yet lost the most in the end that is in my opinion where the avengers falls short it use of poorly developed characters such as loki predictable story line and plot overuse of cg and clich give it his rating sorry avengers fans it might be hard to understand but trust me people who write bad reviews for the avengers criticizing plot and story are well read and any movie needs good and dynamic plot regardless of the genre ', ' once again netflix uses its tv ma rating as an excuse to ruin an otherwise interesting concept for show with scenes that push the envelope but provide little substance the self claimed grittiness of the show adds nothing to the story or character development and is just way of flaunting and abusing freedom of expression heard some buzz that this show was intriguing but didn make it past the first episode wish could scrub my eyes and mind from the things just saw m learning that when netflix originals are rated mature they really mean immature writers could use coaching here just because you can doesn mean you should and skilled artist would be able to imply it all without filming it all intriguing story but viewers will have to dig through lot of mud to sift it out ', ' boring story drama and quite good at action sequences just wanted to make her solo movie extremely disappointed tasky ', ' was waiting for my husband to join me for movie and pulled up this show to put some energy in the room we ended up watching the show and were hooked an amazing journey ', ' what worse than captain marvel ms marvel we really need thanos to wipe out half of disney executives and do it again disney is ruining my 2nd favourite universe it bad for even teen standards not watching any more episodes ', ' poor production was obvious within the first two minutes of the film there was lack of care in the entire opening scene cgi script people just standing around etc throughout the film there was notably bad editing and scenes were disjointed this all said it had delightful comedy with the body switching with many funny moments and even bonding moment also enjoyed kamala family and how they interacted with all that was happening also goose how can you resist fuzzy flerken have mixed feelings about the water planet scenes like in better movie it would have been more fun but here it was leaning into the weird stupid category shame this movie could have been better not lot better but maybe could have been 7 10 if there was more to the budget and editing ', ' truly shocking ve enjoyed every marvel film and then don know what it was just mess from the start couldn care scene after scene seemed just joined together and made zero sense have only ever walked out once in my life from the cinema tried so hard not to but in the end this was the 2nd time truly it was terrible ', ' by far the worst film marvel have made they ve fallen so far from endgame captain marvel is one of my favourite characters and after seeing only 15 minutes of this film had to turn it off the story is all over the place it near impossible to follow and you don know what is going on the cgi is very questionable it either looks like computer game or just cgi from the 80s which may be better than this the acting from the supporting cast is terrible aswell there doesn seem to be no chemistry with the actors and it shows turned the film off after 15 minutes because it just unwatchable if you re marvel fan this film should be the end of marvel movies for while at least until they get the mojo back ', ' daredevil was one of the shows that kept skipping and immediately regretted it after binging the show it was awesome even when started wasn that much interested but it caught me on the way know it was like one of those shows like dark and stranger things that make us live in the world it was like that for me even weeped when when watching the final episode of season 3 cause knew won get to live in nelson murrdock and page again so if you are reading this give this show go cause it filled with marvelous cast story choreography dialogue and lot ', ' shame not sure what was watching the only marvel part of the the movie was the opening sequence ', ' very generic and forgettable movie black widow presents terrible outcome for the character of scarlett johansson and totally bad and forgettable villains the trainer was massacred to the extreme by the script and reduced to an exterminator project the script is very punctured and very weak crisp cuts and very shallow and very forgettable soundtrack like most marvel movies the second arc is totally sluggish and slow getting tedious to watch the third act is totally messed up and the plot involving the trainer revelation gets to be pathetic and horrible which makes him one of the worst villains in the cinematographic universe of marvel the final cgi is pretty bad but the film has mostly good visual decisions an in depth look at natasha and yelena and great action scenes as well as being well placed in the context between civil war and infinite war unfortunately other characters like the red guardian are very poorly explored and show horrible development in addition to excessive cuts in some action scenes and continuity of the same the feeling when you finish watching is that you just watched another clich marvel movie and worse version of the winter soldier film viewed on july 24 2021 ', ' its monkey assassin and they don really do anything with that concept they don lean into the sillyness of it all and try to pull it off with straight face so it just becomes kill bill with monkey no real added value just plain 5 10 nah ', ' while was watching the movie realised why recently martin scorsese and other directors have come out and said marvel is theme park entertainment and not movie or real art there was no point of this movie and there was nothing new to add in terms of story telling it was mediocre at best know will will get lot of hate for this but m worried in near future we might stop getting really art movies because people only watch garbage ', ' they should ve taken the money that they used for this movie and gave her her own disney show feel like that would ve been much better use of those resources it feel like everything was rushed and sloppily thrown together in money grab effort the black widow story is capable of being much better than this ', ' fentastic movie this is my first mcu movie on first day unforgettable moment everyone watch this movie for good experience thank you ', ' ok want my 1 40 minutes from my life back what is this crap this is the bigges marvel flop this film is somehow way more depressing and worse than ant man quantumania we honestly thought eternals was bad but that was only the beginning it was only going to go downhill from there nick fury is actually pathetic in this movie he doesn at all act like the fury we know and love he was more in character in far from home when talos was impersonating him the marvels is just an all around bad movie the script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed which both have an impact on how well the characters and in turn the actors come across on screen ', ' and that is exactly what we have with the avengers sam peckinpah the master director of mayhem action and blood letting who broke down these hollywood barriers in film over forty years ago recognized the necessity of character development for any action to have emotional meaning as technically well done as the avengers is in all the action sequences it lacks any human emotional qualities nobody but the most simple minded that like mindless explosions and destruction will find any interest in this movie movie is simple entertainment that will not past the test of time film is work of art with quality and intelligence that will endure through the years the avengers is 2 1 2 hour movie ', ' really bad editing shockingly bad as matter of fact love marvel and mcu movies but this one is definite flop poor suspense building great music but poorly timed seemed very all over the place ', ' saw this film thursday night at an early showing so this was my first film ever saw before opening night was super anticipated for new marvel film to be back in theaters black widow had all the action the drama the quips it had it all the characters were endearing especially red guardian and natasha sister yelena who were great additions to the universe my only gripes with this film that is kinda consensus with everyone else is that this film should of came out 5 years ago but honestly it does set possibility for the future and tying lose ends to the marvel universe before phase 4 it does great job taskmaster is cool not the best marvel villain but works for the film it is in for sure good time in theaters ', ' hope you enjoyed the movie as much as did good action cool skills and stunts just amazing ', ' black widow numerous delays combined with constant want for her own big screen solo outing and the fact that this is the first mcu film apart of phase four likely caused lot of people to build this movie up in there heads while by no means bad film what marvel movie is black widow is an action packed spy drama somewhere in the realm of mission impossible the actors are all phenomenal in this film with the core family johansson pugh weisz and harbour giving it their respective best the film also has nice lighting design and well choreographed action if not always well shot shortland direction is great and hope to see more from her in the future this doesn rank among marvels best but it not supposed to this is good movie and welcome return to the films of the mcu look forward to see if pugh character will grow from this point ', ' jessica jones is one of those tv series that will get your hopes up by introducing you to compelling story and seemingly interesting female main character on marvel world however it doesn really add much more than that as you keep on watching it first of the way this picture is filmed is quite slow and dull d even say the first couple of episodes are boring it sure gets little bit more interesting as you get to the end of it but it just doesn drive you there the way it should there is clearly lack of emotion passed onto you in those moments where you feel like clenching your fists yes this is an angry person story sad one even bit depressing and you just don get the right feeling from the whole acting that presented to you and boy let not get started on some dialogues truthfully the only character that actually makes you feel something is kilgrave david tennant was brilliant in his performance of this sociopath amazing the scenery even though quite repetitive does feel dark and unsettling which is just what it should be all in all this was quite disappointing tv show due to its flaws in the acting writing character dialogue and its obvious lack of emotion it still worth the watch for its story but if you re looking for truly compelling episodes matching the quality of the original story sorry to disappoint but you won find it here ', ' black widow was action packed the story about natasha was beautiful this movie was worth 32 on disney hope marvel release more movies on stream will pay for good action marvel movies on disney am not quite ready for theaters ', ' movie is way too boring and also very slow star cast is good but the story isn that good only 2 star for it marvel should stick to avengers now flop movie ', ' the first season is nearly flawless it had its lulls in action but they served purpose and it all flowed very well pacing was spot on motivations were clear stuff actually made sense and it was easily one of the best shows ve ever seen what happened with the second season can hardly begin to explain all the motivation the plot the actors everything is off to the point where was convinced someone else must have made the second season it feels like events are dragging the punisher along to bring him to where the writer wants him to be none of it feels natural none of it feels grounded like the first season and almost all the new actors are borderline terrible the shift is night day the difference between game of thrones season one and seven when the writers ran out of books to copy from and people suddenly begin to teleport around continent the difference between ghostbusters and the pitiful woke 2016 cashgrab do yourself favor and watch the first season but only that ', ' only scarlett johansson as black widow and jeremy renner as hawkeye come off as actors playing dress up but despite the assured performances the avengers is unconvincing the illusion doesn stick the story ties itself into knots to rationalize why these disparate superheroes would ever band together under the supervision of nick fury samuel jackson to thwart the villainous loki tom hiddleston right from the opening scene belabored set piece boasting one of the most listless car chases ever filmed the movie feels off everyone talks too much the pace lumbers extraneous characters eat up screen time you hunker down in your seat and shrug it off patiently waiting for the film to kick into gear by the end you re still waiting ', ' seriously don understand why netflix would cancel this show the writing was spectacular the acting was phenomenal the action scenes are just perfect and so much more cannot even express my love for this show was fan of the flash and thought it was good show until watched this haven even continued the flash since because it does not compare to this show vincent onofrio wilson fisk is easily my favorite mcu villain he just so compelling and thrilling he truly brings this show to life jon bernthal as punisher was absolutely flawless wilson bethel as bullseye is fantastic villain and finally we have daredevil himself charlie cox charlie cox is daredevil no question about it just watch it you ll thank yourself this is spectacular more realistic adaptation of daredevil and it works so well the action is done much more realistically making them even better action character development story all the things tv show and movie should have can all be found right here watch it it will change superhero shows for you forever ', ' my wife and recently caught marvel 2023 in theaters the plot revolves around captain marvel mistake in choosing sides during battle disrupting the cosmic balance two young ladies gain powers in the process and captain marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe directed by nia dacosta candyman and featuring brie larson lessons in chemistry teyonah parris dear white people iman vellani ms marvel samuel jackson pulp fiction and zawe ashton blitz this film boasts clean and classic marvel style characters cinematography action scenes and special effects however the plot seems somewhat lackluster with captain marvel possibly appearing more as villain than hero the backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development making it challenging to form connection with them the cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end and even samuel jackson wit falls short of expectations in summary this superhero movie prioritizes its message over compelling storyline while the characters and visuals are in line with marvel trademark style the plot may leave audiences indifferent the lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film 3 10 making it skip worthy experience ', ' managed to see this on an imax screen and think generally it was worth it big scenery and big action need big stage see that on the imdb rating scale female viewers give it 7 5 almost full point higher than the male viewers and don have any problem siding with the women on screen they re the ones who get almost all the action including the expected confrontation with whole room full of red room trainees it must have been frustrating for scarlett johansson who a good actor to have seen her black widow character treated so inconsistently in the mcu in the previous avengers iron man and captain america films first she a shield deep cover operative in stark industries then former spy coupled with hawkeye then on the run with steve rogers then love interest with bruce banner then the one keeping the lights on at avengers headquarters post snap and finally the one to make the ultimate sacrifice so that the big guys can save the universe so this film is long overdue the marvel studios suits really don have any excuse for stalling this long to make female centered superhero movie the first one being captain marvel but that was already ten years after the guys had the field all to themselves black widow should have had setup pre avengers film just like tony stark cap thor or hulk this film gives natasha much of the backstory she deserves along with good if not great standalone adventure so the basic model for this black widow solo is james bond style film fair enough her character isn superpowered she was trained as spy and there lots of international intrigue so it matches well enough just like any bond film it a thin cover for scenery hopping lots of hand to hand combat guns cars motorcycles aircraft and over the top stunts there all of that you might want and the production values are high the added value is to see natasha in the context of her adopted family of former russian spies sister father mother played by florence pugh david harbour and rachel weisz their interactions are fun and think the movie would have improved with bit more of that and bit less of the stuntwork beyond those central four players unfortunately there are just stock villains and side characters ray winstone role as the slimy bad guy behind the red room operation never gets beyond one dimensional florence pugh does well and looking ahead she ll be in the hawkeye limited series later this year though physically she doesn quite have the stature that johansson does for this type of role scene by scene black widow is very involving to watch even if you don know all the previous mcu history but when you think about it later it kind of disconnects into bunch of set pieces that don fit very smoothly why exactly did we jump to morocco budapest then somewhere in russia finally the famous red room turns out to be fortress in the clouds guess because why not it goes smash so much better that way at the end also we watch natasha go through cycle after cycle of taking and dishing out ferocious punishment and keep on ticking at the end she isn even limping bit so it action fulfilment for the devout fans but don think scaling it down just little bit would have done any harm and about the post credits scene well done at the start but then took jarring sideways turn that left bad taste in my mouth it really broke the mood that the whole movie had worked to establish ', ' the background to ms marvel is that kk is character from the comics that factions within marvel have been desperately trying to make happen for years they have pushed this character over and over again and it never happens because the baseline character is just plain dumb she has stupid power set that nobody finds interesting but they badly want her to happen for reasons of representation so here comes the tv series have to admit episodes 1 2 were pleasant surprise hence the 2 stars not perfect but the actress is perfectly likeable they ve done fair job re making her powers into sort of green lantern type thing instead of the budget mr fantastic that she is in the comics came away from the first two episodes thinking that this was decent young persons superhero series sort of spiderman meets diary of wimpy kid with all the busy graphics interlaced with the action d even go so far as to say liked it then the whole thing blows up and the series changes radically from being vehicle for kk into just the most objectionable political diatribe instead of kids superhero show about teenage muslim superhero she takes distant back seat to four hour long celebration of pakistan pointless characters come and go the show really starts to grind and each passing minute seems to take hours to explain minor and irrelevant points which are nothing whatsoever to do with kk the show goes to great lengths to invent and project an animosity over the partition of india as some kind of deep rooted cultural anxiety something can safely say that have never ever heard any indian or pakistani mention once what we are left with is show that achieves nothing crawls at tortuous pace and is deeply irritating in its message which it does not even seem to understand this could have been 90 minute tv movie with half the cast and been standard origin story and it would have been ok as it stands it pretty much unwatchable ', ' the best of the movie the character and the actor playing red guardian for the rest very mediocre the previous main marvel films like avengers capt america ironman what quality compared to this film and current series ', ' this was movie was straight up joke from marvel movie was never about natasha romanoff instead it was about yelena they should ve developed natasha character more was hoping to see natasha rigorous training to become widow how she eventually left red room how she joined shield and became close to nick fury what exactly happened in budapest and how her relationship with clint developed literally none of the questions were answered that red magical mist was absurd they never showed how it was developed and who made it its just there viallins were joke they did dirty to taskmaster with its lame reveal they made him or should say her mute robot lastly this movie ends up saying red room and its deadley widows have always been most powerful behind the scenes secret organisation and they carried out several coups and power changes like what then what about hydra it was established in captain america ws that the hydra is biggest secret agency thats ruining the world but now suddenly introduction of red room destorys importance of hydra imho this movie should ve been disney show and loki should ve been movie ', ' don know how they managed to so monumentally get this wrong total of 5 episodes to the season and really it was so slow and uneventful that they could of squeezed all of the action into 1 episode except for the fact that there was far too many characters introduced to keep track of slow boring messy and far to many subplots going on ', ' not going to rate it yet because am still not sure how feel didn love it but didn hate it it was actually pretty funny in parts too it was bit slow though ignore the standard its woke rubbish comments that any program like this seems to get nowadays edit after finishing it would say it marginally worse than moon knight but only marginally it really didn hold my interest at all ', ' terrible story line wooden characters childish mess really terrible pantomime of movie badly written and acted how did this make it off the cutting room floor they made mockery of existing characters nick fury the comic relief baby sitter how can they have made such great movies and then believe this is ok disappointing how this has happened to one of the greatest movie franchises of all time have never given 1 star review to anything but hopefully if fans speak up and don feed the beast any more money they will listen so sad how the movie industry seems so broken now ', ' daredevil is exactly what expected it to be action packed however has an incredibly good balance between fighting and plot building the acting is superb character development has me on the edge of my seat its not usually what people start of with however the metaphors used through the church and the morals and ethics incorporated are great addition to the tv show love how it showcases the hardships that come along with being the good guy and whether what he is doing is actually in fact the right thing or whether he is turning into what he is fighting against would go as far as to say the fight scenes are on par with the batman trilogy showcasing his powers in ways that are exciting however when he does come up against an opponent that matches his abilities he doesn come out unscathed often you don see the superheroes of the box office having to spend weeks in bed in order to recover from injuries after hard fight so it is good for change to show the actual damage fight can have supporting characters add lot to the show often providing much needed comic relief ve also found myself enjoying characters on the bad side and their personalities character development both protagonists and antagonists are likable which makes the show all the more exciting if you re looking for good tv show one that will keep you captivated wanting to watch the next episode and love suits and batman this is the show for you would strongly recommend anyone with the time to start watching this tv series it truly is up there with the best ', ' avengers is an awesome superhero film and every adjective loud brash kickass applies all the actors gathered do good job either against one another or against blue screen the action is top notch and you might get bit woozy even with all the stuff that happens on the screen this is movie event and it should not be missed under any circumstances must watch superhero extravaganza ', ' in my opinion is the following although the premise is developed in great way giving shape to somewhat simplistic plot as said the film does not redefine any way plot that we have not already seen before despite the fact that represents such concepts much better than any other film in its genre however although imperfect the film satisfies at all times and the scale between hits and misses is good enough to make this an excellent movie ', ' this film was ok but don expect marvel movie to be just ok think the black widow character and associated characters from her past would be better suited to disney miniseries rather than big budget movie definitely one of the weaker films in the mcu but still worth watch if you re regular cinema goer ', ' for long time now ve had big problem with marvel studios behind the scenes content the mcu is the biggest franchise on the planet arguably but their special features on the dvds and blu rays have been extremely lazy and lackluster ever since disney bought the franchise when this was announced was praying that it would finally be the mcu bts content ve been craving for years but in the end it was more of the same here are my two biggest issues 1 the background music it so loud obnoxious and incessant find it so difficult to actually hear in the information m here for it okay marvel won lose interest during quiet moments 2 the editing marvel behind the scenes featurettes are all edited in the style of those short form minute long special look behind the scenes videos marvel posts to social media to get fans hyped for an upcoming movie they re basically quasi trailers that feature the cast or directors explaining the general plot of an upcoming movie paired with footage of the film and couple tidbits of roll or on set footage sprinkled in the mcu as franchise it producers directors actors vfx artists production designers and concept artists all deserve proper deep dive into their work on the level of the lord of the rings behind the scenes for the matrix trilogy for example this isn even disney problem per se because star wars still has excellent behind the scenes on their blu rays too but marvel behind the scenes content including this show are basically glorified special look trailers extended they re edited in the same snappy quick loud and flashy manner that trailers are and when this content becomes longer than couple minutes it becomes extremely annoying and grating assembled is primarily just the actors and directors explaining the show we ve already seen over footage of the show we ve already watched with few moments of actual behind the scenes sprinkled in it as though they re selling us product we ve already all bought now assembled isn as guilty of this as the bts featurettes on the blu rays we do actually get some decent looks into the production of wandavision especially in the first third that explores the 50s and 60s episodes but after that it basically giant recap with the writers and actors think overall my problem is that feel pandered to don come to behind the scenes content to get glorified summary of show or movie ve already seen want to see how it was actually made and don need constant music and quick cuts to keep my attention can just watch craftspeople doing their craft for while love just seeing directors direct with the actual on set sound in the background or seeing costume designers talk us through their process or vfx artists explain in detail how they did what they did this stuff is extremely interesting its what we re all here to see bts content is why wanted to get into the film industry in the first place overall this was fun glimpse into the making of the show but it was just that glimpse didn learn anything that didn already know really hope one day the mcu can give us some making of content worthy of the final product we all love tldr basically just glorified recap than an actual making of show ', ' when it comes to marvel movies one could only expect the best of the best in terms of production and cast members however in the case of black widow the amazing production seems to forgot key aspect of the film two to be exact plots and characters don get me wrong it is emotionally impactful to see natasha confronts her past and put resolve into it however the film didn seem to dive deep with their plots and characters and just basically touch the surface the result is an entertaining blockbuster that constantly makes the audience feel that something is missing ', ' would normally give this show an 8 but bunch of whiny man children who probably didn watch the show or watched five minutes are spamming it with one star reviews good dialogue good cultural references good actionthis fits with marvel track record of success now watch as this review is spammed as being not helpful ', ' they finally explain why black widow doesn have russian accent in this it would ve been better to cast russian as her instead of scarjo though she was never right for the part m fan but this one is wrong for her they could ve gotten russian actors for basically all the russians in this movie but they didn and it didn really work for any of them there are too many times when she should ve died or been seriously injured but she gets away with barely scratch it pulled me out of the movie and made me feel like there were no stakes at all the action was mostly good taskmaster got screwed up though black widow wasn much of main character overall this felt more like movie on tnt with better fx budget ', ' black widow is film that ve been seeing trailers played on my tv non stop decided to give it watch tonight as my sister referred the film to me the beginning and towards the middle of the film looked like it was going to be awesome movie was let down and disappointed this movie is absolutely horrible long and boring wouldn waste time or money on rewatching this film at all everyone hated on birds of prey this film was the worst film of 2021 ', ' this movie was so forgettable im struggling to remember what happened and just got home from the theater couldn tell you the villains name if tried couldn tell you why the things that were happening mattered for the life of me don understand why the massively overpowered captain marvel is having hard time fighting some kree warrior lady with staff when the last time we saw her she was physically besting thanos this movie blows and it unfortunate because the captain marvel character can be really cool went in truly giving this movie the benefit of the doubt it tonally weird one minute it a silly buddy comedy the next minute it a family drama and then before you know it you re in world ending superhero blockbuster it was clearly longer movie that was cut way down for quality and to be honest that probably for the best can imagine longer version of this movie making it better brie larson was not good and that an unfortunate thing in my opinion she just doesn act well in this movie ve seen her do quite well in other projects even recently she does really decent job in new show on apple tv so part of me wonders if it not just her but if marvel has simply failed to give her good direction of what the personality and tone of the character is meant to be she bad in pretty much every scene in this movie she seems very awkward and not in the funny kind of way shes not believable when she being tough she not moving when she being dramatic and she not the slightest bit funny at any point in the film of the few times we ve seen her play captain marvel this by far is the worst the movie lacks pretty much anything to make it interesting bland visual effects average to poor acting lame disinteresting villain simple yet boring plot below average costume and set design you name it and this movie has meh version of it to offer up at the end of the day when the best thing your movie has to offer is random samuel jackson jokes cat jokes and the humor of kamala khans blue beetle esque family dynamic you probably don have winner on your hands this movie makes me long for the days of thor 2 ', ' in the grand scheme of things the long time coming standalone natasha romanoff black widow film doesn play any truly significant role in the extended marvelverse avengers world but as is now to be expected from the marvel cinematic wheelhouse and even more so at the moment tv space australian director cate shortland feature film is an above average summer event film that never becomes anything more than you expect as it fly along at rollicking pace all the way towards another cgi invested explosive finale kicking things off in great fashion with throwback to natasha early life as part of fake american white picket fence family nirvana cover songs included black widow wastes little time getting stuck into the action as we join up with scarlett johansson romanoff in between the events of civil war and infinity war as she becomes estranged from the avengers team and on life changing quest back to her home country where she rediscovers old family including sister yelena father alexei and mother melina these new additions to the marvel world are played by scene stealer florence pugh the first of now many planned gigs for her in this universe stranger things favourite david harbour getting the films best laughs and rachel weisz and all three performers are key reason to black widow success and while romanoff and johansson get too do more of the same as we ve seen multiple times before shortland and her creative team maximise the opportunity to add some extra flair and spice to proceedings with these new characters as black widow looks to stop ray winstone generic russian baddie while dealing with deep seeded family issues at the same time balancing nice mix of thrills spills and perhaps little too much family frills black widow does feel in many ways like different type of marvel film more bourne than talking raccoon and troublesome evil grimace and the action and carnage here is mostly frenetic and in your face more down and dirty than we ve come to expect from marvel previously in this side of their offerings and it helps give shortland film different energy than some of the more clean cut comic book fair we ve had over the last decade one thing that hasn changed however is yet another explosive riddled marvel final act one that not only outstays its welcome but fails to close out the film in refined and satisfactory way and where the film worked so well in more singular moments and action that was smaller in scale other than prison break out that gets real very quickly the finishing touch to black widow is but another procession of cgi showmanship that is technically of the highest order but far from overly memorable or gripping shame considering the groundwork leading up to it final say the first marvel film in many moon is more of the same solid stuff from company that has perfected its offering into finely tuned machine black widow isn necessary or groundbreaking but its winner for comic book fans and those seeking quality made blockbuster entertainment 3 1 2 mind controlled pigs out of 5 ', ' the avengers is film like no other never have so many super heroes appeared on screen together often it is the case where film suffers because of huge star cast but director joss whedeon has definitely done his homework and given each super hero decent amount of screen time and build up the action scenes are flawlessly executed and are easy on the eyes unlike some recent action flicks these days there are few scenes in the movie that are insanely funny mostly involving tony stark and the hulk the story is nothing new but the fact that it is carried out in such linear and smooth fashion makes it an amazing watch loki aka thor brother returns as the villain and does good job at being bad nick fury is decent scarlett johansson looks sexy in black playing the character of the black widow only this time she has more screen time than what she got in iron man 2 jeremy renner is impressive as hawkeye after his last hit mi ghost protocol in conclusion think avengers is the best action movie this year so far with mind blowing special effects and enough scenes to make you get out of you seat and applaud or maybe blow whistle or two it would be interesting to see if gi joe retaliation matches up to this when it releases in late june ', ' of all the avengers movies this is the best one why because it the introduction to the team it raw it magic it new shiny and beautiful yes the other avengers movies can be considered good except ultron of course that just bad but they absolutely don have the magic of the first one at this point they re just going thru the motions notching every box to say hey we re superheroes first ones seem to be the winners cap although the 2nd one could be argued as being better thor iron man and avengers ', ' this marvel classic is one of the best tv fiction series ever made have you noticed that on rotten tomatoes this series amassed as much as ninety five or so percent on tv com this series deservedly or more earned 8 1 in comparative with imdb there is huge contrast most of the hardcore critics rated based on only season 1 and 2 now get it that the season 1 and 2 left an impression which was nothing to write home about most critics justify this with the dull boring and drama over the top in seasons 1 and 2 for superhero tv series there should be an engine which steams out great action in balance with the drama that was the first and only mistake of the tv series from season 3 onward this show etched place in marvel history as classic that can be compared with the marvel cinematic universe movies don know why critics don give the show chance because season 1 went badly mean the show went on to produce as many as six more seasons to make up for it if you are reading this just be patient through the first season from season three to the current you will find out how worth the sacrifice was agents of shield is one of those modern series that gets better season after season episode after episode the team really learnt from their mistakes the consistency this series has maintained over the past six or seven years must be recognized if you are reading this give the show chance and you ll see for yourself the arcs of the various seasons introduced various unique antagonists one great theme the show thrives on is the fact that it showcases variety of villains who will entertain you no matter what every season also drives the viewers to whole new universe and new adventure awaits the protagonists of the series are also pivot for the success of the show comedy and drama are well balanced the acting is also very great and the relationships between the characters are not rushed another which the series can boast about is the cgi and action scenes unlike most tv series whereby less amount of finance are spent on the cgi and action scenes agents of shield goes otherwise the battle scenes are really worked on and nearly comparable to that of marvel movie action sequences this show is really great and deserves more ', ' the marvels is cute kitten showreel with some superhero cosplaying served on the side it truly felt as if they had plucked several random actresses off the street and asked them to do superhero impression for 105 minutes this girl power group was unfortunately very wooden bar possibly brie larson as captain marvel but even she looked bit bewildered and gormless visuals were good but an over reliance on cgi was self evident the antagonist dar benn felt straight out of cheesy sci fi from the seventies or eighties and the joke to serious ratio was as usual for marvel off kilter ', ' the premise is really good and so is the acting by the lead actors unfortunately terrible writing direction and editing messed it up beyond repair it a really stupidly made show and that especially disappointing because it was nice to see brown people being represented responsibly m giving it 5 stars because of the really nice desi details focus on partition racism etc ', ' two episodes in already love it target audience is definitely teens and the episodes hold the attention while providing enough interest and intrigue would continue watching ', ' this film not meet my high expectations as fan of all marvel movies so weird comedy put in the natasha background family usual fighting arts and lack of scenarios ', ' com to marvel movie for lots of action and some comedy relief in between unfortunately this title delivered on neither swear there was 45 minute scene where they didn leave the house seriously they sat at the kitchen table and talked for 45 minutes in marvel movie sad send off for scarlett ', ' if this show wasn a part of mcu wouldn even skip through the episodes m only skipping through to the end just in case won miss something related to mcu you know in case they make the mistake again to add yet another boring character to the team along with winter soldier hawkeye falcon etc ', ' the marvels is pretty ok movie do like how they made captain marvel and monica more likable in this film the drama between certain characters is little cliche but do appreciate they don slow down the plot with that ms marvel is adorable she reminded me of peter parker with tony stark love how youndon need to really watch ms marvel tv show to understand the character some of the visuals towards the end of the film is pretty impressive love how short it is however the movie was messy messy messy with the tone and pacing the villian does have an interesting reason in being the villian but it isn executed well don love it or hate it just ok ', ' over the the last few months the anticipation of this movie hasn been too high but marvel continues to show us over and over again that they re more than capable of making fun action flicks that the whole family can enjoy while it was never as fantastic or game changing as some of its predecessors captain marvel has solidified itself in vast film universe will continue to root for marvel as they continue to reduce gender roles and give us fun and often times relatable characters there not much to this review but hope that anyone who reads it feels like they should see the film ', ' love this movie so much brilliant amazing favorite line is have nothing to prove to you this line is for everybody ', ' one of the worst written series of all time season 1 was decent with the help of luke cage and kilgrave this season wasn so bad season 2 however is train wreck the writers should be fired the characters in season 2 are utterly terrible you find it hard to care about any of them and as the season progresses you find you hate them even more there are so many flaws it becomes painful to watch if you re thinking of watching it do yourself favour and dont there plenty of other great shows to watch on netflix ', ' first marvel runes thor and now capitan marvell what are you thinking it was so bad have hard time putting it towards wouldn be surprised if were told that the story and the script were written by first graders there was no meaningful story absolutely childish and the whole movie lacked any substance what so ever it could not get more cheesy and worse than this the whole movie made the good actors and actresses look like newbie amateurs feel sorry for them having to act this nonsense seriously please do not make any more movies till you get your act together this soncall movie was unbelievably terrible ', ' it an odd film starts off bit slowly but soon gets going there some good action and fight sequences but it does fall down in places and the plot is bit weak ray winston was badly miscast with strange cockney new york cabbie faux russian accent it all starts off quite serious but there are few much needed laughs and the main saving grace was florence pugh who complety stole the show we enjoyed it in the end just don take it too seriously ', ' this stands side by side with the cinematic film work of the marvel universe proper superhero series with some excellent cameo and supporting stars to the main team really recommend this to all marvel fans and those who simply enjoy good yarn ', ' this movie is very fun but seems quite lacking at times its got some great and inventive action but most of it was shown in the trailers ', ' watching the punisher feels like watching an 80 seagull movie where seagull is angry all the time for no reason jon bernthal is not good actor see no real emotion or logic for the way he acts can enjoy show where the main character is so evil it paints the idea that killing is ok as long as the victim is not girl or an adolescent castle also seems to enjoy killing and torturing people tried to watch the first season but somehow found myself rooting for russo due to my dislike for the main character eventually gave up because there seems to be no sign of changing it a shame because really enjoy daredevil but the 2 characters couldn be any more different an evil maniac for protagonist what were they thinking ', ' the great gathering of the heroes that started the marvel cinematographic universe iron man hulk captain america thor and loki united in one single film this movie has very good premise that begins the franchise of the marvel universe with great cast that perfectly interprets their characters they bring to life these incredible characters that have long lived in comics or cartoons this movie has very good and promising action scenes and special effects that get all the attention definitely this is one of the best marvel movies ever my final rating for this awesome movie is 10 10 ', ' literally don remember anything from this movie more formulaic marvel media not horrible just not memorable would recommend watching this only if you were huge marvel fan other viewers can skip this one ', ' it seems lot of people who watch these films miss nuance don know how anyone can say this film has no heart and is all action and explosions one thing ve truly enjoyed as more women are getting shot at directing is the emotional content and character development they typically bring to what could be over the top action films there aren a ton of those moments in film like this so the key is to make them count the interplay between yelena and natasha is at times poignant and at others cutting david harbour also does good job as the self absorbed father figure don think we have to view this film as having wasted or ruined taskmaster either let think back to origins wolverine and consider how we felt about deadpool seems that worked out fine in the end yes fully expect to see more traditional rendition of taskmaster in other mcu properties the plot was predictable but it was actually refreshing not to have the writers and director think they can pull one over on the audience for change it doesn always have to be about the plot twist the ending left the mcu open to taking black widow in new direction or at least adding another high caliber actor to the universe personally m fan of florence pugh and look forward to what she can bring to the mcu in the end this film met my expectations which were high considering the cast and director its pretty rare when these films exceed my expectations because ve actually read the source material the writing in the better comics is really good and often doesn contain typical hollywod endings so its rare film that can live up it especially with pg 13 rating ', ' marvel has become so unserious and kiddish kamala khans character acting is so cringe feel like m watching disney xd or disney channel movie what happened to the seriousness the good acting the emotional connections between the audience and the story mean nothing feels right anymore can believe that this is what marvel has come to d really like to know who is responsible for phase 4 of marvel and personally have talk with them this is unacceptable ever since infinity war and end game nothing has been the same and it literally could have kept getting better and better but instead things are going into downward spiral ', ' another one of those which makes you wonder if there even is casting for the series or some rich powerful guy just buys the roll for his daughter niece and that it this girl is so bad at acting it impossible to watch more than 1 episode m sure this serie had some potential if the lead role was good actress but now it just wasted m sure there was some ethnical reason for giving her the role but at least they could have chosen someone with some acting skills ', ' don rate anything 10 10 d have to say this is my favourite avengers flick long time coming now was the perfect time could you imagine how different the tone of the film would have been before 2017 bad arse women running around in black latex kicking ass never gets boring since black widow was mortal not like himbo thor with his big hammer or dc fish guy who always looks likes he just walk off the set of magic mike the action in bw was like bond movie or mission impossible don be fooled by the low meta score well worth it loved it ', ' the avengers is the first team up movie for the mcu combining iron man captain america and thor alongside with black widow hawkeye nick fury and of course the hulk to fight the maniacal and oddly comical in all the best ways loki brother of thor and part frost giant and this movie is everything you could ever think you would want in super hero collaboration film joss whedon wrote and directed this film to perfection with the team up of everyone being seamless and interesting with various conflicts throughout and the almost certain that they could never work together ever until the end each character feels used amazingly with comedy being brought in perfectly drama at the perfect times and whole hell of lot of action in this 143 minute film with expanding on lot of the small quirks of each character and the nail biting tension throughout the film done by the fantastic direction and great feel of this film joss whedon put in all he could ever do in this film and executed it perfectly the writing by whedon is also flawless when first saw this film in 2012 honestly thought these actors were real with how fluent and smooth their dialogue was combined with the acting done too by each and every cast member even the one scene actors shown throughout not single actor had any opinion in the writing of the film and with solely whedon writing it you can see how well of writer he is and how smooth he can make the conversations in this film especially my favorite parts of the dialogue are the small on going jokes throughout the film with each character it brings the light out of some of the darkest scenes and can make each and everyone as memorable as possible remember quoting this film like it was religious text or something with how well written it is the acting is once again perfect robert downey jr plays once again flawless tony stark with either his smooth and slick execution of every line to him hiding snacks throughout the sets to add to his quirky character that the audience has grown to love and appreciate in the film new comer mark ruffalo in the mcu also kills it as bruce banner hulk with his uneasy performance and social awkwardness too everyone else chris hemsworth chris evans scarlett johansson jeremy renner samuel jackson also do amazingly with their roles with smooth balance of comedy and seriousness in each of their scenes the casting in this series is still flawless and don want to change single cast member with their respective roles the avengers is fantastic movie that will be put down in history as one of the best superhero movies to ever exist and should deserve its popularity and praise for its technical accomplishment and storytelling milestone the avengers gets 10 10 ', ' great show don turn away because of the first few episodes almost did but am glad didn they don pull you into the show until about halfway of season 1 in my opinion after reached episode 6 or so couldn stop watching perfect blend of action betrayal love and hint of humor hope this show continues to stay on air for years it will never get old and it is just full of twists and turns that will make you suspicious of every new character it will keep you on the edge of your seat every single episode every single season every single minute is rich with excitement and anticipation this show is 100 worth your time don miss out ', ' massive step down from the amazing daredevil filled with dirty scenes for no reason disgustingly dark to the point that is makes you feel sick and even getting past that it is also boring and painfully slow paced if you are marvel fan like me then do your self favor and skip this ', ' m usually very excited to watch superhero movie but after hitting couple of really bad ones kind of lost my faith for an amazing one thought of skipping this movie figured it was overkill to have so many heroes in one film but good reviews and the fact that it had joss whedon prints all over it tempted me to go see it anyway and was not disappointed in fact was amazed the threat to earth is genuine and the action spectacular but what really makes this movie stand out for me is the fact that it combines serious action with sharp humor seemingly without effort and it is endearing to see very human flaws in the heroes you ve come to love felt it was well paced movie where every hero got to shine in their own way annnnnd think coby smulders should definitely feature more in movies like this one honey that outfit was ehm well tailored if you haven seen this one yet run don walk damnit to the nearest theatre for an amazingly entertaining 2 5h ride that ll still leave you yearning for more ', ' what total disappointment yes there are great action scenes and the acting is good however the plot and storyline and script are worse than bad this movie had very bizarre beginning and then nothing pieces together after that no one in our house had clue what was going on am not writer but am very confident that could have written something much better than this this is poor storytelling ', ' the most boring first episode out of all the mcu shows receiving powers by just putting on bracelets lmao idk about but there much better phase 4 is mess ', ' save daredevil don let one of the best super hero shows of all time if not the best die so soon daredevil doesn deserve this fate he is the one who keeps the city safe so the avengers can save the earth can believe such masterpiece ends so soon ', ' it different from the comics but that not bad thing it a different feel from the other shows and seems like it got potential can wait to see where this series goes ', ' really don get the florence pugh hype love scarlett johansson usually but she not been given enough to work with why focus on pugh ', ' after 4 out of only 6 episodes in it getting there they re trying to open up the history line at the expense of showcasing her powers potential which would be fine if we had enough episodes to develop both angles action sequences are well played out but the lack of her potential powers is annoying running on gut and reaction would be fine if we had 8 or 10 eps for her to grow in knowledge faith instincts slowly boxing themselves in putting lot on 2 episodes fo answers still m hooked enough to root for another season true super powers with control to emerge edit just finished the 6th final episode it is definitely more aimed at the younger audience especially compared to the rest of the marvel franchise however must say that even then it was rather enjoyable from an old mans point of view like mine laidback didn take itself too seriously and visually quite the unexpected decently high production values with purposeful camera angles the director specifically had in mind 2 3 shots in advance d like another series and will my up my rating of 8 to solid 8 5 just for the last episode ', ' marvel character finds problem marvel character calls some friends for help marvel character finds out something they didn know marvel character seems to have lost marvel character actually wins yep standard disney marvel recipe complete put it out for people to watch make load of cash rinse and repeat m being really generous with my star rating because they had the guts to actually do black widow movie still better than either of the wonder woman wonder why watched them movies but that not saying much it like death and taxes now there bound to be an iffy disney marvel movie or show along every six months or so it got to the point where it like watching soap opera because we re only still watching because we re invested in the characters soon enough the normal people will stop watching because they re not invested in the characters in the first place ', ' m so bored with comic movies and shows wish they would stop making them especially bad ones too much of bad thing and can see how any demographic benefits from bad representation mean if you want to celebrate demographic you should make it good otherwise it just insulting but mostly this show is boring lame and stupid waste of time and resources d rather watch paint dry ', ' watch this show with my 11 year old daughter we absolutely love it especially for my daughter who at the moment is seeking an pakistani american identity this shows islam and muslim is positive fun light thanks ', ' enjoyed 2 things the cats and brie larson who can do so much more but with this script not even iron man could have done something this time the negative comments are right it was mess the teenager the random singing the villain the poor dialogue the drama which is not really drama the ghost of what could have been don get why anyone would think this is the best direction for marvel and am afraid to seeing what coming next get they now try to bring more current matters into the mix but not everything has to be an ode to smth let it be superheroes world as we used to have it ', ' universe that has some decent cinematic moments good character work but also some key elements that let it down liked the basic plot and character arcs which are set up well by brilliant opening sequence highly reminiscent of the americans after that think it gets bit stop start and hit miss also some scenes feel bit too close to movies like bourne and kill bill at times like the dynamic between natasha and yelena scarlett johansson and florence pugh have excellent chemistry and both give strong performances it takes lot to rival johansson presence but pugh certainly shares the stage with strong charisma there are some great feminist themes plus other allegories about the oppression of freedom with the two lead characters plus others written well to translate them on screen ', ' watched the first season of daredevil with little anxiety obviously remembering the cough wonderful ben affleck movie however need not have worried the first season was practically perfect couple of missteps here and there but almost perfect therefore rated it 9 on imdb second season comes around and to be honest it ventured too much into the mystical areas of the mighty hand it was still really good but not as good its first outing so bumped the rating down to 7 putting it in my mind as good dc offering such as arrow or flash season three comes along and lo and behold have to change the rating again its simply perfect if could give it 11 would all characters are given ample time to shine and even newly introduced characters are given full backstory even if its doesn match up with comic lore watched episode 5 and daredevil is only in the episode for like 2 or 3 minutes but it was still amazing to watch thank you marvel thank you netflix simply perfect show ', ' if this movie would have came before like endgame or just after it it would have got so much more because its great movie but the delay in release just lowered its connect ', ' the wife wanted to see it and im marvel fan so thought it would be good idea to watch it for date night long story short we both left the theater disappointed acting story and flow sucked ', ' this movie is all over the place the only character that you can enjoy is iman vellani character she actually somewhat funny then we can get to the highly unnecessary planet where people sing mean did they run out of ideas on languages and just decided to plug in musical for the entire 1 hour and 45 minutes if you can make it that long you ll be asking yourself just what the hell is this movie and who the hell wrote it this movie marks the event of the fall of super hero movies maybe soon disney and kevin feige will get there act together and make movie that people actually wanted to see instead of this mess ', ' those who are degrading this movie haven seen the post credit scenes stood up in the theater at the post credit scene the movie though was an average one give the 9 for the credit scene brie larson completely fails in expressing the situations in which she is the casting could have been better waiting for the endgame ', ' season 1 was pretty awesome was waiting for season 2 guess what it lived up to my expectation ', ' even watching this chronologically during an mcu rewatch does not help the fact that it remains one of the most unnecessary and misplaced mcu films to date very very very mediocre all around nothing really that interesting honestly except maybe yelena and natasha dysfunctional relationship and family dynamics which is ruined 90 of the time by weisz and harbour comical russian accents and terrible comedic timing do not enjoy their presence in the film at all and that why felt like the first half is much stronger the film would have been lot better if it had been released anywhere in phase 3 and especially before avengers endgame 2019 florence pugh as yelena bolova is fantastic addition to the mcu need her in every film even if it doesn make any sense there was lot of great potential in exploring natasha past and present both of which have her experiencing fallout with her foster and found families it would ve been great psychological character study on the world that she has been brought up in but instead the film goes with the most generic choices available mash up of different espionage films and stories seen hundred times before with some terrible writing overlong action set pieces and laughably bad cgi it a not good sign when the story budapest within the story is more interesting than the actual story ', ' dont think ive ever seen series in which became so attached to the characters dont even know how they did it maybe they just had such good chemistry in real life it came across on screen and didn take itself too seriously truly miss this show ', ' this movie was like syfy channel had budget for better special effects the script is terrible and the acting is subpar and corny for several moments during the movie felt the cringe and it can be challenging to watch it is like the actors were still on strike and didn want to be there the only person who actually delivers is iman vellani she honestly seems to be having good time and hope to see more from her another surprisingly good aspect is the fighting choreography it is curious how all the top moments and highlights from this movie are actually when the actors are not taking ', ' loved to whatch all marver movies and tv shows there are still some serious projects but in last time instead of good action am watching comedies pleas marver start to do actions in future again ', ' and you know what expected it to be another thing dunno why even when it marvel and it is always the same god damned thing with natasha romanoff thought they could pull it off as simple but effective action movie too bad nothing of that was given to me what got was senseless plot pretentious dialogue wanting to belong to family drama but failing and cgi so bad it almost killed the movie by itself for example there a scene helicopter falls and crushes to the ground as pathetic attempt of making humor hey marvel trademark there but how the hell do you pretend to be funny when the helicopter looks fake as hell and has cgi effects all over it come on that was pitiful dude when even the cgi is against you you know you are in big trouble then one of the main plot points of this movie are feromones yes you heard right and that plot point appears magically as plot device in the moment to create some conflict so it completely stupid the action sometimes is kinda interesting give the movie some credit for that but the movie is way too long and way too talky and in the end for what just make straightforward action movie marvel ok is that so hard by the way don wanna talk about the post credit scene is one of the worst ass pulls after credits ve ever seen 4 10 ', ' this is my second viewing rarely watch show twice but something about the punisher tv series is so well done it brought me back the acting and writing are excellent the action scenes are good but suppose it the story itself of an essentially go man fill with rage and need for vengeance that compelling the different movie versions are good too but like the tv series for developing thorough back story all the characters are well developed and demonstrate ambiguity and nuance it really modern morality play with numerous characters facing both an inner and outer struggle simultaneously and as in real life it never quite certain if good will win or even where good and evil end and begin the moral ambiguity is good the character of dinah is excellent and in sense the show is her as much as frank castle as she is heroic in the pursuit of justice ', ' it is unfathomable why netflix has cancelled such excellent shows as stranger things jessica jones and the punisher these three programs collectively are some of the best television have ever seen and have been watching television for very long time as matter of fact it was medium d given up on years ago until discovered netflix admittedly some of the music leaves me bewildered little and an example would be what has got to be just about the worst cover of an old dionne warwick tune ever recorded but all in all wish netflix would reconsider cancelling these shows netflix please give them another chance please ', ' knew there was lot of hate for this film and didn care too much for the trolls the truth is that the film is little too much at times there was better story to be told and this typical storyline won conquer new ground as female superhero film it is nice to see women breaking new ground in the marketplace we only need ms marvel to come along the film is safe and doesn twist the narrative to justify the running time captain marvel is super powerful and should have been introduced earlier ', ' 1 they don show us his power 2 the drama is made for teenagers and it stupid 3 the only good thing about this show is the fight scenes lol skip most of the talking scenes ', ' the avengers is still one of the best movies of the mcu the characters were cast perfectly with everyone give good performance the story was good and loki was the perfect villain not many have been able to live up to him ', ' don understand the double standards that disney has it preachy poorly written bows down to religion but still manages to get the woke message in they disrespect their other shows all the other heroes men kamala own culture america there not much that they low key don hate on and her friend the white kid who helps her poor guy is friend zoned for life don think people would have issues with it if they just would put aside their nonsense and make good show ', ' bad guy tries to destroy world brave hero heroes stop him really tired of the whole concept the movies are repeating it over and over again the movies need to come up with new concepts rather than focusing on these repeated ideas ', ' binary reviews abound these days too many reviewers think that if the film they re watching isn the best film ever then it must be the worst this film occupies neither end of the scale yes it all action the plot is aimed at the brain dead the script is all too predictably formulaic the effects are very cgi heavy and it unlikely to ever win any awards for anything it a superhero movie and they all follow the same pattern so you ought to know what to expect it certainly not the best superhero movie ever and it equally not the worst it occupies that glut of movies in the middle that are adequate to pass couple of hours with but you ll be unlikely to ever care enough to watch it twice it actually has more feel of an old bond movie seeing as the titular heroine has no actual superpowers and the villain would look equally at home in dormant volcano stroking his cat when movie is this average it hard to actually find things to praise or hate ', ' no other movie has done better job combining different main characters with different ongoing storylines the justice league got nowhere close even the overrated but better than original snyder cut not jurassic world dominion not star wars the sequels which are also very bad the only piece of fiction that would argue that did as good of job combining characters is game of thrones this movie also set the standard for invasions and cgi fights kept you invested and was pure fun to watch when hulk stops the giant alien worm and the 6 unit in pan around shot complimented by the legendary music every audience member goes nuts and you are left with goosebumps this same music is played during the thor wakanda entrance and portal scene from endgame point being that this theme is used only for the most epic music this is top 20 scene in fiction and one that would shape history in film before this comic superhero movies weren all that popular this is when as young kid became hooked and am still now with the mcu very disgusted to see how bad phase 4 is turning out to be iron man and hulk carry this movie with samuel jackson nick fury and black widow adding strong support will say this was weaker movie for thor and captain american and his awful costume nick fury and black widow do great job of tying all the main characters together and introduce the audience to shield every scene on the helli carrier was worth watching loved how randomly tony pointed out the galaga player and the team argument hulk is terrifying which he should be and we get see him on both sides his fight with thor was short but epic loki is an amazing villain to go up against everyone hiddleston gives great performance with little it makes sense why they didn kill him off in this one the death in the movie was sad but necessary to provide some stakes the end invasion was kept simple enough to show off every character and it ended in unique way captain america vs iron man is great concept and started in this movie they make for great allies and rivals black widow bruce iron man and captain america opening scenes were all good this is the only movie in which have liked ruffalo as bruce will say he did great in this one don care about the comedian in the other movies end credit with thanos set up everything and kept the audience wanting more ', ' what has gone wrong with the grim with the revenge factor of frank castle the new girl makes it even worse with her not so perfect acting miss the suspense from when frank used to devise missions to kill enemies one by one earlier he used to hit the enemy before being hit and now he is always getting shot and exhausted ', ' everyone a scientist and pro of space and time and quantum physics and very little to no explanation of anything the action scenes were meh the cat scenes were meh and over the top the bunch of made up switcheroos was nauseating this was just waste of time marvel have failed us am so sadden by this poor spectacle spin off should not happen no joining of forces whatsoever please make it stop there was nothing amazing about this movie gone are the days when you watch film and be amaze you feel the might through film you feel the emotions the characters as well it all gone ', ' if you know the story the only things that will matter will be the special effects if you don know the story the only things that will matter will be the special effects why well there is no story just special effects lots of them there is no plot nothing makes sense unless you know the characters backgrounds and if you do you will think this movie should be at least an hour longer so the screenwriter could squeeze some actual dialogues in between all the action if you take away all the eye candy this movie would be less than 15 minutes long major flunk imo this is movie to forget about after you leave the theater and talk about some of the scenes people might have enjoyed it goes into utter oblivion m sure won be looking forward to buying this for my dvd br collection ', ' tries to be serious realistic drama and fantastical pulpy comic at the same time the comic stuff works the serious drama aspect fails miserably it is not grounded in reality at all this is unfortunate because it is not only complete waste but also detracts from the comic aspect these two styles can not blend together the final product comes off as though it is confused about itself did not watch iron fist but jessica jones luke cage and the punisher are all superior shows with more focus ', ' mid and boring couldn even finish the first episode this show is by far the worst disney plus mcu show to date and thought wandavision was bad don watch this ', ' total waste of my time for those who watch all it is only recapitulation for those who didn watch it just funcy preview 2 points for good cut ', ' had wondered if this character could carry movie by herself don get me wrong like her character but she is much better when paired with hawkeye and the other avengers while it had its moments this movie is bad version of the bourne trilogy with all women as the agents it didn add anything to the mcu and agree with another poster that it was basically filler episode the bonus scene was one of the better parts glad waited to watch it on regular disney plus ', ' ms marvel has the excellent production values and music we ve come to expect from marvel movies iman vellani matt lintz yasmeen fletcher rish shah travina springer and aramis knight do an excellent job but the rest of the cast seem inconsistent in the quality of their acting in addition to its problematically lop sided misrepresentation of indian history the series is inconsistent in it focus and rapidly switches between three or four plot lines only two of which needed to be included ', ' with short run time they did very well with the pacing of the film bringing in characters from both the tv side and previous movies worked really well to create story for everyone plenty of lighthearted and emotional character arcs that made the film even more grounded then other marvel films with longer run times great thing is there is no need to see any of the disney plus shows because the film does great job giving you brief backstory of ms marvel the duo of carol and monica work great along with kamala and her family plenty of laughter from great one liners that made me leave waiting for the next movie can forget the many cameos ', ' the marvels is thrilling superhero film that follows the interconnected stories of three powerful women carol danvers k captain marvel kamala khan pakistani american teenager with shape shifting abilities and monica rambeau former air force pilot with photon manipulating powers as they navigate their own challenges their paths converge in an epic battle against formidable enemy testing their strength resilience and the power of unity the film openness to representation and diversity reflects the changing nature of superhero stories it celebrates the strength and complexity of its female protagonists offering refreshing departure from traditional male dominated superhero stories the inclusion of kamala khan marvel first muslim character to headline comic book series adds significant cultural dimension to the narrative and will resonate with audiences seeking authentic and inclusive representation the plot weaves together personal journeys cosmic conflicts and the enduring spirit of heroism it explores questions of self

creates an immersive and emotionally resonant journey while the marvels excels in its portrayal of multifaceted female protagonists and its visual spectacle certain plot elements may feel familiar to seasoned superhero enthusiasts and the pacing occasionally rushes through character development but the marvels is must see for fans of superhero cinema offering potent blend of action heart and representation the film positive message and excellent acting make it welcome addition to the mcu canon with its exhilarating visuals and compelling characters the marvels is superpowered spectacle that soars ', ' m comic book nerd grew up on spiderman men and anything and everything stan lee and jack kirby helped produce had seen every tie in movie in theaters as soon as had chance remember watching iron man and everyone had told me to stay after the credits because there was huge surprise waiting for me at the end so began the most painful 4 years of my life in the 1960 comic books were fun excursions into world where magic science and wonder all coexisted it was world where it would be perfectly normal if giant dragon man with the abilities of spider and god straight out of norse mythology all got into fight to the death know lot of people are going to disagree with me so m just going to go ahead and get to my point the avengers is the greatest superhero movie of all time but what about the dark knight you may ask the dark knight was fantastic film in it own regard but that sense of wonder and mystery was replaced by realism and fear which is ok because you don go to batman movie expecting him to fight against large supernatural force but for me the wonder and fantasy is what really defines superhero story whether it a comic or movie anyway the avengers were assembled perfectly this is truly benchmark in the movie industry successfully combining the universes of four different movies into one creating the grandest spectacle have ever seen on screen if you haven yet recommend seeing all the tie in movies before seeing the avengers if not for the sake that they are all great movies by themselves then for the fact that the avengers will be lot more enjoyable if you are already familiar with the characters joss whedon has done remarkable job of taking each of these characters already having such strong personalities and making them interact with each other for me the beauty of this movie wasn the action scenes it was the interactions between the characters whedon really understands these heroes and speaking of action scenes let talk about how awesome the action scenes were was afraid that the trailer had already shown all the great moments in the film but thankfully was wrong was really wrong there is plethora of fights in this movie both between the heroes and the villains and between the heroes themselves and every hero gets their moments in the limelight even black widow and hawkeye who was worried might bog down the fights were just as much of part of the team as thor and iron man were but let be honest here this is the hulk movie hulk had disappointed me in most of his previous movie outings but not this time joss whedon finally got the character right you can see the fear behind banner eyes the sense of hopelessness in his voice he really is cursed but must learn to use his curse for the greater good and when he finally does change into the hulk hulk smashes hulk smashes lot the avengers can be passed over as marketing scheme it deserves every cent that it reeled in from it opening weekend this isn just great superhero movie it one of the greatest movies have had the pleasure of seeing ', ' disney owned marvel continues ruining iconic characters based in fantasy world of established comic books that in itself is tragic feat result is this film scarlett johanson was well cast acted as black widow in avengers films with her hawkeye this film has no resemblance to the black widow in avengers films plot

last disney is determined to reverse genders in past superior marvel films true to comic bookd by creating only female heroes for empowerment thennwhy does this film showcase following female sexual stereotypes women lib battled for generations by show casing following facts 1 females widows are all in early 20s petite model thin bodies attractive face full bust teen boy size model like rear 2 no

time period all above highlights supposed sexual stereotypes esp in repeated clips showing only teen girls of every race however asians not indians from india still have no speaking lines in marvel films just wallflowers decorations so much for equality disney fell asleep during the ending action scene after fast forwarding the middle of the film couldn bear watching the boring acting dialogue plot after enduring first 45 min no plot ending except to set up more insipid sequels to martel disney cookie cutter film machine def skip it do not waste one time nor saw this on streaming bc theater trailers already looked predictable dull like most marvel films in past 7 years ', ' avengers assemble is the best superhero film ever made thought it was better than the dark knight and as soon as it started felt like seeing harry potter all over again at the cinema it mainly follows up from captain america the first avenger thor and iron man 2 h e d boss nick fury brings together group of human superheroes who have different identities and events in their pasts iron man robert downey jr hulk edward norton is out mark ruffalo is in captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth with h e d

bit more laughter in this than any other sh film don know how the sequel going to turn out to be after you ve seen this you ll be asking the same question as me how will it make it bigger and better it like transformers dark of the moon but the autobots replaced as marvel superheroes without shia labeouf and decepticons replaced as the villain giant army ', ' predictible boring bad acting of female character and no chemistry between characters have watched 7 episodes and gave up as did not want to waste my time on this show ', ' so ve seen the marvels and have theory they are clearly thinking long term like decades long franchise here and what think they re doing which actually explains lot recently is try to hook in an younger audience to the mcu to grow up with the next real long term phase they know us hardened fans are done and whatever they make can save us from hating on it all so feel that this latest movie was clear signal that the baton has been passed to the younger generation and that they are beginning to build from the beginning again with younger actors and younger themes to accommodate and prepare the next young generation to be fully hooked in for the next ten fifteen year ride and you know what personally think that ok and when you watch this new movie with this in mind it is quite easy to enjoy it and have fun hope they manage to build universe of characters up that my kids enjoy honestly because we were the lucky ones we lived when stan lived and enjoyed the source material and the real comics and some of the mcu before it changed m interested to see what they do next but now m watching these movies with my kids because used to love marvel and hope they can enjoy the stories as much as did ', ' this is the worst marvel series ever it feels this has been created to appease just one community and the directors have made pathetic storyline and were too eager to show someone from there community in mcu ', ' was looking forward to this since like agent colson and was glad that they hadn killed him off after all but this was very disappointing there was the worse dialog that have heard on tv in long time boring preachy characters limited plot think they thought that fancy cgi toys and ming na wen would make up for all of that well they were sadly mistaken about five minutes into the pilot was giving up about 30 minutes in got up and washed the dishes that should tell you something guess it you really think about it if you re can do superheroes since all of them are on the big screen what was joss whedon really going to be able to do with this except spotlight colson too bad ', ' the action was top notch as was the cinematography and vfx casting and performances were decent and the soundtrack had some really good remixes but expected much more for the 133 min runtime the pacing was slow in some parts and had many long and dragged out scenes there was just too much filler and not enough substance in the story the writers needed little more imagination the concept was there but the execution wasn as good as it could ve been had it been trimmed down to 90 100 mins may have enjoyed it more it also had lame attempts at humor probably the worst of all mcu films and it not like there weren opportunities to throw in some comic relief for me the most suspenseful and interesting part of the entire film was the post credits scene it a decent one time watch ', ' well it is difficult to make every avenger independent character movie hit liked the case the story not that much cgi etc not up to the avengers level but like stated in many previous reviews can be too choosy especially where there are no new movies to watch if you have seen all the avengers movie than it a must and you have not much choice to make it not that boring just little when you compared to the others ', ' this has been an excellent show so far that really captures the character from the comic each episode packs in so much with the development of kamala personal life relationships and heritage plus discovery of her powers development of them and the lore the pacing has been great fitting all of that in without it feeling overstuffed or not enough time being spent on each part the acting throughout has been fantastic with iman vellani in particular being superb in bringing across kamala personality ', ' this is super solid fun well choreographed action entry in the marvel universe very similar feel to the winter soldier and civil war acting is great fight scenes are awesome and the humor is well timed and refreshing ', ' m sorry for all the marvel fans but we have to face the facts the movie was boring and bad luckily didn see this movie in the cinema or pay lot of money via stream it was included in my disney offer with no extra fees just paid with wasted lifetime the cgi was good as usual only the old russian helicopter you could see it didn always fit in with the scenery ', ' this was supposed to be the origin story of the black widow but all saw was confusion to begin with the first 5 10 mins was confused about which one was yelena and which one was natasha the story seemed rushed there was no origin story who is natasha who are the parents nothing this movie is all about feminism and 2 hours of mind numbing boredom ', ' ton of negative reviews citing the lack of story or villain in the first episode they re clearly introducing new character and the villain is her struggle between her family culture and her desires as an american teen we ll meet the prototypical villain in due time the first episode was visually beautiful and there a beautiful story being told that typical white audiences aren familiar with those who can recognize it just haven gotten outside of their own bubble ', ' childish writing screenplay and editing this along with other shows and movies after endgame makes it as if mcu phase 4 is completely targeted towards kids ', ' very few times are my high expectations over come by even greater payoffs but avengers definitely did that for me for one think that it had lot of action scenes and few of them took really long time but then again it was really long movie so it also had plenty of time to develop plot and characters thankfully it allowed the movies to do lot of the backgrounds for the characters otherwise we would have been in for an extremely long ride the hulk was the standout character for me out of all of the superheroes in this movie he was by far my favorite and has been my favorite for very long time joss whedon seriously knew how to make this movie into fanatic wet dream and he held plenty of tension and plenty of drama in all the right places along with the kick ass action sequences though would have liked ed norton to be the hulk in this movie the actor they picked for stand in was right on the money for great bruce banner he was mild mannered smart and cool headed well you know what mean and the greatest parts were his action sequences by far loved just about everything in this movie especially the cliffhanger at the end stay after the first round of end credits if you re real marvel fan you ll go yeeeeeah like did in the theater this one is definitely for the marvel dvd collection ', ' daredevil has always been character that ve enjoyed in the comics but never been massive fan of however the first series convinced me that done correctly superhero series could really bring character to life and they certainly did that with this series whilst slow burn the first four episodes take patience to get through once it gets into its groove the remainder of the series is exciting storytelling at its best charlie cox completely nails daredevil and vincent onofrio is superb as the kingpin and then series two came to be featuring my favourite comic book character the punisher series two just kicks straight into the action and the story arc of bringing the punisher into being is excellent jon benthal is just brilliant he brings the punisher straight out of the garth ennis series of punisher max comics and onto the screen the punisher is exactly as the comics portray him even when the series comes close to making him appear soft they go straight back to what the essence of the punisher is the direction is excellent the plot is taught and never leaves you wondering about what going on if you re fan of daredevil or the punisher highly recommend watching this show even if you re not fan then there still an awful lot to enjoy about this series ', ' this is made for kid which is fine guess there are kid shows that as an adult can watch and still enjoy but this is the kind of show that is only for young children to enjoy has kid pop and bollywood music in there too not my kinda thing many children may like it though the cast try but this show needs much better writers very disappointing ', ' so huge marvel fan here but older marvel fan was only ever introduced to this character via the marvel video game needless to say found her unlikeable even in that experience so honestly was excited to have my mind changed by the new series lets face it disney has done bang up job with the marvel mini series thus far was wrong to be excited could not even finish the first episode it was just the regurgitated m social outcast no one notices me peter parker esk backdrop it doesn work didn care and the show gave me no reason to just not good found the drivers test scene and every moment leading up to it just absolutely cringe worthy hahaha lets perpetuate the stereotype that there culture cant drive so funny gag dont waste your time with this o ', ' 13 episodes later marvel daredevil it not stretch to say it the best thing to come out of the mcu for film and television personal opinion daredevil does not need to deal with box office return strategy prime time restrictions or broad mass appeal shticks and casting to garner cash grab audience not to undermine the empire marvel has created but there was always safe for all gloss in any of the movies and tv shows that are wittier and prettier then they needed to be the leash is off on the well directed shot edited written art direction and action choreographed tv show with few exceptions calling it tv show even sound cheapening of what amounts to 12 1 2 hour well done movie even overshadowing many of the mcu movies that are just trying to out due the previous in spectacle and style rather then story and substance netflix with house of cards orange is the new black marco polo and continuations like the killing and documentaries like virunga further beat down the traditional media outlets doors this old boy esque 6 min fight at the end of se1 ep2 scene without shaky camera cuts stupid radar vision and super hero who never tires proves the discipline that show runner drew goddard exercises bravo ', ' this long awated movie finally came and it was amazing ', ' don think anyone who gives this movie 1 star is fair this movie is definitely not great but good enough to pay for it is it must see movie yes if you are marvel fan is it skippable yes if you don care about super hero movies ', ' could only handle 3 or 4 episodes of this but from what saw it much more of vehicle to promote progressive ideologies than it is quality entertainment we get it there aren many super hero shows movies with female leads but that not an excuse to give this show good rating if you enjoy being beaten over the head with sjw fueled garbage or tend to express approval of things because feminism then you will probably love this if you want to watch an exciting super hero show with the kind of action and plot you re used to would highly suggest avoiding this at all costs from the start the message of this show is men bad women good it not subtle deep meaning type thing either it dumb obvious lazy crap but seriously if you re not womyn who constantly refers to the patriarchy would recommend spending your time doing literally anything but watching this show ', ' somehow marvel has made film worse than the abomination known as new mutants just stick to aliens vs predator requiem please ', ' can watch this anymore as krysten is bad actor calling her acting skills wooden is unfair to wood ', ' this movie gave 10 not just because love marvel but because it the first superhero live action movie where we saw team of superheroes fighting together to fight threat that could change the world we have not seen that since the first iron man came out and no dc movie has come out with one at the time when it was released so that fact that we saw that happen was insane and everyone around the world wanted too see it because of that reason and it surpass my expectations and everyone else too the movie was great and sets up bigger threats in the movie and in the post credit scenes which would definitely recommend you staying for nothing could have made this movie better as superhero movie ', ' story that makes absolutely zero sense utter garbage wish could have the that time back just such waste of time watching it was confusing from the start and had no flow what so ever who ever wrote this story just put bits together without regard for the marvel timeline nothing added up or concluded one of the most disjointed and pointless movies have ever watched and every step of the way was saying just why then at the end another character introduced that also made no sense if there is sequel will avoid it at all costs just cant say any more than this without spoilers don waste your time ', ' my honest review season1 was good but season 2 is massive disappointment it looks like some school kid was written this story and directed undoubtedly this was the worst series ever watched ', ' to put it simply the black widow is typical spin off of the marvel movie world heavily indebted to the spy action genre and well known hollywood works in the genre in fact we are on the side of spy trailer like the bourne movie series mission impossible and even james bond which wants to combine family drama comedy with the life story of popular character like natasha romanov in marvel specific formula slowly with such descriptions it will entertain you as long as you control your expectations otherwise we are dealing with very simple film that has serious shake up in the body of its story ', ' for four years marvel fans all over the world has been anticipating for one of the biggest superhero mash ups in motion picture history we have been promised this movie for so long that now one of the biggest motion picture phenomenons has finally hit theaters big superhero names such as iron man the hulk thor and captain america has finally recruited together and they re off to save the world once again in an unstoppable group wow this is easily the best movie of the year so far can talk for hours and hours about how excellent this movie is first of all director co writer joss whedon is probably one of the best storytellers to know how to make movie and its characters realistic and relevant take joss whedon previous film the cabin in the woods for example which does perfect job of making the story look realistic and the characters look totally relevant that the movie making magic that joss whedon adds in the avengers filled with comical gags this movie also feels like 2 hour action comedy film the jokes are timed precisely and the humor is downright believable robert downey jr is still wonderful for his performance as tony stark k iron man chris hemsworth is brilliant as thor mark ruffalo delivers one of the best portrayals of bruce banner k the hulk ever seen on screen and chris evan delivers more better performance as captain america we also have supporting cast that reprises their roles from previous marvel movies such as scarlett johansson drop dead gorgeous as black widow jeremy renner as hawkeye samuel jackson as nick fury tom hiddleston as the villainous loki clark gregg as phil coulson stellan skarsgard as erik selvig and gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts it such wonderful treat to watch all these marvel characters that we all know and love and place them all into one movie the 3 only works few times but the breathtaking action scenes are just downright breathtaking exhilarating exciting and mostly entertaining the action scenes are probably some of the best action scenes ever put to film you ll be on the edge of your seat wanting for more the comedy is just hilariously relevant the action is downright entertaining and the characters are written in such realistic way sat in the movie theater with the 3 glasses and the entire auditorium was fully packed with tons of super fans everyone was laughing applauding and cheering during the entire 2 hour 22 minute movie can easily see why this is non stop exciting cinematic phenomenon that perfectly knows how to do one thing and one thing only give the fans what they want the avengers is hilarious exciting breathtaking and non stop fun motion picture that deserves the attention given from fans all over the world this is also one of the best movies of the year the avengers in my review an astonishing and breathtaking motion picture an excellent extravaganza of cinematic proportions ', ' look while respect them massively don read comics never have and think it okay for movies to take creative licence when basing story on comics people get so angry over things that movies change it is movie not comic liked taskmaster in general wish they won more fights but apart from they they seemed pretty badass anyway to the plot enjoyed it the twists are nice and unexpected throughout the acting is great the fight scenes are creative for the mcu and the cgi is outstanding as always really enjoyed this movie more than lot of other marvel movies like thor 1 and 2 iron man 2 captain america etc etc so many people base their reviews off of the comics just enjoy the movie for what it is movie think it great ', ' this is dumbest and most boring movie ever seen imax 3d didn make it better the primitiveness of the plot and dialogs between characters is probably excusable for the movie built based on comics book couple of flat jokes and tons of trivial visual effects that is movie cheap fast food type of movie o soul and template based product for mass consumption actors the actors were acting well huh it their job after all scarlet was charming as usual but unfortunately character she was playing didn give her much area to reveal her actress talent must admit her russian accent is very very awful sad to see that so many people really liked that stuff giving high rated exited reviews there somethin wrong with the world today aerosmith ', ' if you consider watching the punisher suggest you should stop after season 1 honestly really enjoyed season 1 it wasn perfect but it was really good it had really gripping story form ep 1 to 13 and episode home is one of the best episodes ve seen in tv show unfortunately it could nt keep it up for the second season the only good thing in season 2 is the acting and that basically it season 1 8 8 season 2 5 0 ', ' slow bad acting over acting hardly any action instead just talking greatful for when ve finished the series ', ' flash bang boom followed by blah blah blah imagine waste of situps and electricity so epic it deserves exxonmobil logo placement marvel musical find myself wishing there was another rating for movies like this mb for mel brooks satire worthy can do this you re too late that not how family works and kittens oh my like this review boated to fit required form factor without regard to how it gets there loved you captain and you took advantage when ideas fail

the three marvels kamala khan aka miss marvel captain marvel and whatever the third one was called honestly couldn be bothered to remember and together they try to save the world here the thing with this movie really did not with all fiber in my being wanted to watch this at all whatsoever but because have this little annoying completionist in me felt the need to watch it even though knew it would be straight garbage trash ve watched all what mcu has offered so far yes even the series through trash and not so trash and actual good movies series so thought why not just get this sorry excuse for marvel movie out of the way already and oh boy was ever so right this movie stunk more than don even know what felt like 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life was wasted and by the way that was the only good thing about the marvels that the run time was only 1 hour and 45 minutes instead of 2 or 3 hours thank god anyways if you like torture go ahead and watch this if you don like pain go ahead and skip this really wish did ', ' after delivering wonderfully crafted show with agent carter marvel is back with another one daredevil am not daredevil fan in the sense that ve never read the comic or care much about the character the ben affleck movie that kind of like is the only reason know about it and what the daredevil netflix series did was to give the movie fans sliver of j vu meaning felt was getting into something familiar but at the same time they delivered brand new show the new feel is brought in by lot of things some more subtle than others but they all help to distance the show from the movie the costume is one of them obviously different but they did one better they grounded the vigilante story and abilities daredevil isn hopping from building to building jumping so high that you wonder how is he still human this incarnation runs jumps basically does parcours and gets the sh beaten out of him his fight scenes and stunts look plausible realistic but boy does his cracked ribs and black eyes heal quick it is subtly explained how he seemingly gets back on his feet after serious beat down but it sometimes once actually feels unrealistic or supernatural like the familiarity of the show first mentioned stems from matthew murdoch back story and the people he interacts with but also the sets they have in my opinion very successfully distance themselves from the daredevil movie but not completely some of the sets can easily remind us of the movie they seem to be inspired by the same thing probably the comics since never read them wouldn know but the familiarity of stepping into world we know is there also loved that they showed more than just murdoch back story but wilson fisk as well it gave more depth to fisk character and also blurred the lines between him and daredevil without really depicting fisk as an antihero he straight up evil manipulative and dark but the smart thing is fisk really believes that he is doing good thing for the city he the villain of the show for sure but he the kind you could maybe root for or at least understand even if the guy does has the emotional stability of child what the saying again one man terrorist is another man freedom fighter it looks like it is what they applied to the show by not making wilson fisk one note character they ve first built him up harry potter style as the he who must not be named to give him some street cred menacing persona then layered his persona with emotions to make him relatable to finally show us how dark he can be how far he will go daredevil was so smartly tied to the mcu by subtly mentioning the heroes the avengers and the destruction of new york city in the very first episode and more bluntly in others but the show somehow stand on its own tying such dark show into the mcu feels weird because it means this is happening in tony stark or spiderman backyard but guess they can be everywhere it almost seems like iron man spidey and the other are in the big leagues and daredevil is in the minor league on the come up for now the daredevil show is dark bloody and addictive watched the whole season in two days that how captivating it is the show is definitely an origin story not just murdoch and as origin stories goes this is the best marvel has produced it seems that marvel has learn from their mistakes agent of h e d and got right again with this one wornoutspines ', ' season 1 was great season 2 was great season 3 was freaking amazing got so invested in season 3 and was thinking there no way they could top this in s4 sadly s4 didn happen the actor who plays daredevil is daredevil incarnate he the perfect person to play this character m just so blown away but how good the sequences and fight scenes were in s3 ', ' either don get the new world of marvel or they don i liked one episode that was it won watch the 3rd season for sure ', ' ahhhhhhhhh watched it yesterday and yeah so late cause of my exams but what great choice it turned out to watch the movie after all speaking of 3d effect their no doubt its one of the best after likes of avatar and tintin now talking about the storyline well it isn something special just same old story but the execution makes it different experience mark ruffalo as hulk was incredible and no need to say about iron man the coolest superhero of all liked the verbal fight between iron man and capt america agent hawk and black widow were good and thor and capt america were also good but for me as told before hulk and iron man were best to put end to this review one line from the movie capt america to iron man what are you without your suit iron man genius billionaire playboy and lots of love to avengers and will see the first day first episode of avengers 2 ', ' serious flaws such as trying to mix light comedy with brutal fights to the death and editing that is often confusing when it not simply bizarre but among its virtues is showing everyday pakistani life with its extended families and the marvelous zenobia shroff who does more with her voice in one episode than many actors do in lifetime of performances fwiw ve heard several complaints that the teen angst aspect is all too predictable but the lead is indeed teen and many of her issues will necessarily be common to her age group what the writers do however is shift those issues around just enough while integrating them into her powers so as to make them fresh and even charming ', ' brutal action thriller series series starts after the events of daredevil season 2 season 1 was completely engaging and also gave some seat edge experience season 2 had some problems with its storytelling had its ups downs yet delivered good content main positive was its action sequence gun blazing actions gruesome gore violence and well choreographed characterisation for each characters were well written drawbacks bit let down and inconsistency in episodes in season 2 and low production value overall not great series but falls under the category of good if you like vigilante series with brutal action then definitely ', ' know some of these characters don get lot of love but personally liked the captain marvel movie ms marvel series so naturally was really looking forward to the marvels unfortunately it was major letdown for starters this movie was cut to seriously the editing job on this film was the worst ve ever seen there are abrupt transitions where you ask yourself how did they get there or when did these guys connect or wait she was just really sad mad but now everything is fine including scene where the main characters face the big bad it was jarring and completely inexplicable you can also tell that lot of the backstory scenes were cut because feel like we were never really shown much about the motivations or history of the generic bad guy this is the first time can recall ever noticing the editing being an issue outside of an indie horror film second the acting was soooooooo wooden especially like how ms marvel has been portrayed but even her scenes fell flat the characteristic marvel humor felt out of place or maybe mis timed honestly it just seemed like everyone was phoning it in lastly won spoil the credit scene which was cool but it had the worst cgi that ve come across in an mcu project feel free to skip this one ', ' love the series find it very attractive engaging and realistic love the way miss marvel acted hope hope hope hope in future will get more fun to watch ', ' the marvels 2023 movie review the marvels review nia dacosta brings the first ever female superheroes assembled version with the marvels featuring three mcu superheroes brie larson as carol danvers teyonah parris as monica rambeau and iman vellani as kamala khan join forces against dar benn played by zawe ashton this is the first time that we have three leading ladies and female antagonist together in marvel studios film that adds one more reason why this film should attract more females to cinemas however as male viewer didn have any issues watching and enjoying it the marvels has to be one of the most comically funny superhero movies in recent times gotg 3 and thor cosmic adventure did attempt that organic comedy but couldn bring it out the way they wanted here the marvels does it and it so visually attractive some films look grand on imax and are made for such experiences the marvels is certainly that one what this film lacks is emotional entanglement and usp factors that define the overall motive if you aren looking for that then be assured you ll have blast watching the marvels this diwali carol aka captain marvel brie larson has destroyed supreme intelligence at kree land which makes things worse for the locals amongst them is dar benn zawe ashton and she is off to settle the score with carol aka the annihilator pet name they gave to captain america she harnesses the power of the band similar bangle kamala khan has and pairs it with her staff named the universal weapon to tear apart jump point in space more jump points mean more problems in the timeline and more destruction the trio of the marvels captain marvel monica rambeau teyonah paris and kamala khan iman vellani must assemble to stop dar benn from destroying earth and other planets but there is problem all three female superheroes possess similar powers that are connected to the power light and the jump point has made their powers entangled whenever they use power they switch places as in they transport through time spaces will the trio overcome the problem and find way to stop dar benn it no secret that the marvels is the mcu shortest movie ever and let hail the screenplay writer editor and director for that 105 minutes is the full runtime and you have 10 minutes of ending credits in that so the ride is actually only about 95 minutes long you find your seat finish your popcorn and half the film is over you then put your hands on cold drinks and samosas and the film is over hell yes it that super fast mcu needed break from some of those boring flicks that always felt 15 20 extra long and here the marvels did it they were reading lot of reviews guess even nia was of the same opinion when it starts when you are in midway and when it ends you don even get time to calculate that it fun at all time high for the mcu but the only problem is that it too predictable kamala has bangle so that makes her equally powerful as dar benn and eventually they win it too mainstream man kamala fangirling looks cute in the beginning and since she is teenager it all looks so humorous but after while the same fangirl moments start getting on your nerves and you feel like is captain marvel god we didn know it the musical parts are hilarious you don get moment to analyse what just happened and why you laughed but moment later it all feels soapy are we into an opera show asked my friend on the right seat and he was already scratching his head kamala can use her powers to clear the mess at home why carol can tell about her story from aldana but she can take kamala and monica there what the logic dar benn end and monica sacrifice are so overly dramatic as if we didn know about the end credit scene oh wait there is huge surprise in the end credit scene and should advise you not to leave your seats before that brie larson performance as captain marvel is maybe typecast but that the best thing about her cm has to be how fans imagine her and she has that certain appeal beyond her glamour iman vellani is set to win the hearts of all teenagers who watch the movie her accent and innocence just can be hated or disliked she is the fan girl you want to be she lost in fantasy but that okay for that age when she was dancing at aladna the entire theatre was hooting it wasn that high of moment but you know sometimes your character and your portrayal make it bigger teyonah parris as captain rambeau has done well in that emotional scene while the rest of the time she was just passing the time with decent act zawe ashton has been impressive be it in terms of looks or that ferocious attitude despite such glamorous face zenobia shroff possessive mother and mohan kapur urdu dialogues are going to impress indians while samuel jackson fury remains unshakeable saagar shaikh gary lewis park seo joon and other supporting cast members are okay talking about visuals the marvels is cinematic treat have been lucky to get chance to see it at imax and that has certainly escalated my viewing experiences the visual effects are simply beautiful the fight sequences are breathtaking and so well choreographed the first action sequence when the leading ladies keep switching places and then in the ending when they again switch places under some boundary against the antagonist are enough to recommend this film for big screen viewing also love the sound effects of imax when your seats vibrate during noisy scenes you feel like living the moment in real life and the marvels has some scenes of that standard nia dacosta has made super entertaining film no doubt it just cliched that all from the basic surroundings to every major conflict everything is predictable that the biggest issue with the marvels some scenes go overboard while trying to make funny impression but they work against the film especially that mediocre climax so much hype around the band and dan berr and you don even give it proper large scale conclusion the marvels lacks few textbook things like this while the rest of the film is super entertaining and full of joy take your families and enjoy the female superheroes assembled version from marvel studios this diwali don worry the cat won eat you rating 5 10 ', ' omfg just finished binge watching this show and it was an absolute masterpiece in my opinion personally loved it more then daredevil which thought would be impossible will now move onto my review will start with the story which is about women named jessica jones obviously who is pi and she solves cases while dealing with sadistic villain love the story and the vibe of it which flows alongside the movie sin city and has very noir aesthetic which coincides perfectly with the narrations done by jessica throughout the series will now move onto the acting which was superb mean krysten ritter as jessica played perfect alcoholic investigator even enjoyed luke cage played by mike colter and the relationship that they form the rest of the cast did amazing will say though that the character who stole the show for me was purple man aka killgrave played by david tennant he is by far my favorite new villain in the marvel universe mean he is fiendish barbarous and delusional loved him and he played his character to perfection will now move onto the action which was thoroughly entertaining will say it didn have the action packed scenes of daredevil but it was hell of lot more psychological which is what gets to you in the end and there are some very bloody scenes that actually surpass dd in many respects have never read the comics for jessica jones but this show is show you don want to miss will also say that the sound design and the cinematography were superfluous will finish by saying that this initial season was fantastic and you should watch this show immediately promise you will not regret it was tad disappointed in the finale but have my reasons and will not spoil that but all in all applaud marvel for there 2nd dive into marvel inspired television show that has paid off in dramatic way ', ' was so so excited to finally see black widow solo film after all these years of waiting but unfortunately after watching was so disappointed after watching almost 2 hours of boring flat storyline that had such predictable plot wasted villain and honestly the film was an insult to black widow legacy don waste your time watching it very boring predictable sloppily done and the only good parts about it were the couple of very short fighting scenes yelena and the post credits scene which was honestly better than the entire movie honestly if you just watched the post credits scene think you be all set ', ' am obviously minority here but am really puzzled by all the hate for this movie what did everyone expect exactly and since when did everyone become such an expert this movie is absolutely perfectly fine mcu instalment it is not as good as any of the avengers team movies but much better than say iron man 1 2 or captain america the first avenger etc the story was for me compelling especially since am not huge fan of all the time travel stuff it was story of friendship redemption and recognizing your mistakes the action scenes were great the cgi was great and the acting was great brie larson is doing absolutely fantastic job as captain marvel again and the trio just works fine actually really liked the villain story not one of those heavy but also often senseless ones in the comics but villain out of need so all in all really enjoyed this movie will gladly see it again 10 from me ', ' netflix jessica jones 2015 is easily one of the best things in the marvel cinematic universe d rate it 9 out of 10 it smart it funny and it extremely dark don want to spoil too much by revealing the modus operandi of season 1 villain but his manner of destroying his victims is utterly disturbing ve mentioned before how his powers seem like plot device from stephen king novel although this series excellently retains comic book feel due in part to its episodic format its story elements frequently feel like something out of john carpenter film and although know m repeating myself yet again this hell kitchen niche of the mcu feels like its chosen stage for horror thrillers the cast is excellent krysten ritter is perfect as the titular hard drinking antihero private detective mike colter is nearly as good in the role of luke cage another low level hero in the marvel universe colter talent is evident by the fact that cage could so easily come across as one dimensional character and jesus doesn the guy look the part the story villain kilgrave is played by fan favorite david tennant yes the name kilgrave is stupid and is lifted from the comic book source material its silliness is lampshaded in the series several times by other characters making fun of it tennant is an actor ve abhorred in the past there was no logical reason for it there used to be just something about his voice and his face that made me cringe it was running joke for while among me and my female sci fi friends good lord how the ladies adore that man my admittedly irrational dislike of the man even detracted from my enjoyment of the otherwise quite enjoyable 2011 fright night remake he phenomenal here he perfect for the part as ritter and colter are for theirs and he was alternately menacing and quite funny he has perfect timing and line delivery as ritter often does really liked watching him jessica jones might succeed more than any other mcu property in terms of dialogue and character development although the iron man and daredevil series also do great work there it a tough call the show also seems to flesh out the mcu into kind of lived in universe in way that other marvel properties usually haven by creating detailed three dimensional protagonists out of characters that have no superpowers whatsoever they re not sidekicks trope that the script that slyly winks at they re realistic characters that affect the plot when one or two actually appear to develop superpowers toward the end of the season the consequences are unexpected and dire furthermore jones cage and most of the other characters have power sets that pale in comparison to c heavy hitters like thor the hulk or the vision the result is that the mcu feels more integrated and nuanced with blurrier line between superheroes and everyday people liked that hell of lot the show is not entirely without its failings despite what said above about the show attention to ordinary characters still think it went bit overboard here the character of malcom nicely portrayed by eka darville began as hugely interesting supporting character so too did other residents of the heroine apartment building it was nice touch that expanded the show scope and depth until the law of diminishing returns kicked in by the end of season 1 13 episode arc felt that they received far too much screen time the support group that one character attends started out as an intelligent subplot but then eventually grew tiresome again m being necessarily vague here to avoid spoilers towards the finale actually felt that these minor characters were padding the plot and dragging down the narrative which brings me to another criticism the narrative length this is yet another show that felt could be edited down bit as much as loved tennant here and found kilgrave to be an interesting villain m not sure that jones conflict with him warranted 12 52 minute episodes this could have been abridged to eight or ten think another criticism had of jessica jones was its fight choreography for show that succeeds on so many levels the action sequences were sometimes surprisingly poor why do brawls between superpowered individuals include so much polite and bloodless grabbing and throwing especially when single punch or kick could easily kill or incapacitate an opponent the answer of course is that those kinds of melees are easy to film with minimal training for the actors it especially noticeable here because this show sibling daredevil has fight choreography that is some of the best ve ever seen if you re curious then search for daredevil stairwell fight on youtube sometime the rudimentary effects were usually even poor when depicting the title character jumping scenes she has super strength so she can virtually fly short distances by literally jumping these shots looked like something out of primetime 80 action show all in all though this was indeed great show don shy away from it as initially did because you re unfamiliar with the title character it among the best that marvel has to offer ', ' this movie wasn really bad kept hearing from the left that it a feminist movie from the right it an average movie the truth is they are both right but neither need to be obnoxious about it if you need to tell someone your movie is about how great it is to have strong female character then you haven made very good movie about strong female character if you need to tell people movie sucks because it has strong female character you probably need to get life this movie was way over politicized and at the day it was better than thor 2 and not as good as marvel the avengers ', ' the first 2 was really good really hard to get of the sofa and take pause but the 3 on trish made us so annoyed so unbelivable embarrasing we went oh no please fast forward and stop it she ruining everything she is doing good job but they are making fool of herself and the hole jj3 ', ' while rated ant man and its sequel along with deadpool well this movie was not great like most movies of this genre it was just big fight scene and scenes of people using their powers interspersed with the glorifying of the military would never in million years watch this movie again there is more to say on this film however don like this film for the same reasons that don like the 2009 star trek movie it just ends up being one big battle scene and you don know what is happening or with whom becoming extremely hard to follow don mind sci fi films or those with battles but it needs to be something organized where you can understand what is happening rather than not as that lessens the enjoyment of watching movies such as this perhaps am also negative about this film as generally do not like superhero movies as they seem bit too elitist for my taste which is why like films like deadpool or deadpool 2 which lampoon this absurdity directly d like to end by saying that this film will obviously be liked by many and probably did swell in the box office so in these opinions am likely in the minority but that is fine as am wholly principled about my opinions on this film ', ' this is not that bad didn like the ms marvel show on disney plus found kamala boring in that but here she more like the comic character that loved brie larson is given more to do in this too the first captain marvel was just her sulking for 2 hours she much more relaxed in this film she even funny few times 1000 improvement as for photon sadly underutilised don think they ve figured the mcu version of her out yet although the mid credits teaser gives us hope that she ll play part in the future this isn a perfect movie the villain dar benn noticed the youtube trolls never complained about the gender swap they re such big fans and they care sooo much about source material dar benn is boring and forgettable unfortunately the trolls do have one good point this movie does rip off spaceballs doesn even try to hide it the plots lifted directly from spaceballs ', ' the marvels disappoints with its attempt at grand narrative stumbling under the weight of excessive flashy visuals and gimmicks the film reliance on spectacle overshadows any meaningful depth in its storytelling resulting in lackluster experience characters lack the development needed to engage the audience making it forgettable addition to the expansive marvel universe unfortunately the potential for compelling narrative is overshadowed by the film struggle to balance style with substance leaving viewers with sense of boredom rather than the anticipated awe there was maybe one good scene in the whole movie ', ' think right now to comeback dc ms marvel stroy is flop and also over acting drama please don releases in india yes give 1 rating because the name used marvel so love it and please don make this type off movies thenku ', ' love my marvel films however when it comes to ranking my heroes black widow along with hawkeye rank near the bottom of my favs list the makers of this movie made up for that by giving us great supporting cast want to see more of the red guardian in future marvel projects ', ' good movie shame it took so long to get scarlet top billing great on screen charisma fantastic performance in respect she knew her character was deceased however the best scenes are stolen by the red guardian even though he plays the clich homer simpson character that middle aged men get saddled with today go see it fun popcorn movie ', ' think that am quite hard to please when it comes to superhero films but scarlett johansson and florence pugh are definite plus points of course decent script and plenty of mind blowing action also helps and m glad to say that black widow delivers both strong story and lots of incredible special effects packed set pieces for those not overly familiar with every entry in the mcu the film might prove little confusing at first but it all eventually slots into place and ultimately proves to be highly entertaining blockbuster comic book adventure as children natasha and yelena are part of russian sleeper cell based in ohio their father alexei david harbour and mother melina rachel weisz working for general dreykov ray winstone who oversees the red room academy where young girls are trained to be assassins black widows after completing their mission the family escape the s and the girls are sent to dreykov for training twenty one years later natasha johansson has defected to america to become member of the avengers and is now on the run as fugitive can remember why meanwhile yelena pugh is still working as killer under the influence of powerful mind control serum when she inhales an antidote and regains her free will yelena contacts her sister and together they endeavour to kill dreykov and destroy the red room all the while avoiding deadly killing machine taskmaster olga kurylenko don know who cate shortland is or how she got this plum directing gig there nothing in her resum to suggest that she could handle movie of this type but she does surprisingly good job combining action comedy and drama to good effect with decent pace sustained throughout the two and quarter hour runtime the performances are solid although winstone russian accent occasionally slips with particularly good turns from pugh who makes amends for midsommar and harbour who provides much of the humour the fight choreography and cgi is very impressive and perhaps most importantly the film is whole lot of fun from the white knuckle opening scene to the spectacular explosive final act ', ' the story in this film goes like this all men suck and woman are awesome and have to save the day men are lazy stupid obnoxious sleepy and are completely useless we are there to crack unfunny jokes and look pathetic while females save the day ', ' ve been totally burnt out on superheroes but this brought something different and totally fun this is the kind of movie the word rollicking was made for hilarious lightly goofy while still having great fight scenes and some real emotional connections it right up there with thor ragnorak in tone and not taking itself too seriously loved seeing the lighter side of my beloved captain marvel and getting little insight into her galactic adventures the cast is excellent and they play off each other beautifully zawe ashton makes charismatic villain and the three marvels all pull off the comedy action earnestness hat trick production design is on point with some beautiful worlds nia dacosta nailed it appreciate that this movie went for some over the top comedy thought was not interested in any more marvel movies but now hope we get to keep seeing these characters ', ' the creativity of the team was on another level the acting in the show is flawless everything feels so alive unlike the other shows splendid job by everyone involved in it hata off to all of the team ', ' kudos to marvel for making movie that shows strong independent women who work hard to reach their dreams and who support each other when no one else would it was fun to see the beginnings of agent colson and nick fury and of course goose the interaction between fury and goose made me laugh all in all it is well worth the price of admission ', ' awesome show great story line great characters great actors down to earth no politics just good old entertainment ', ' was actually very disappointed in this show which is surprising because love most of joss whedon work say most because there are some film and tv shows he done that have never seen overall love his writing style so was excited for this but it really disappointed me everyone know that pilot is usually the worst and most series get better but m still on the fence was expecting more from this show but it just hasn captured me all the way the cheesy comedic one liners worked so well in the avengers but in this show they re just really cheesy and it makes me cringe ve only seen the first two episodes so m hoping it gets better after while watching all the marvel phase one films h e d seemed pretty bad ass and cutthroat but this shows just makes them seem weak mostly blame disney and the rating system for the abc network despite the huge following marvel has the content is becoming really watered down for the sake of having tv show fit the pg 13 rating unlike most don have an issue with the effects or anything else because know tv series will never have the same budget hollywood block buster has but m just not sold yet have enjoyed the shows arrow and even the series premiere of the tomorrow people more than agents of shield and that show is just huge rip off of other films was hoping that marvel and disney would use this show as platform to introduce some secondary avengers marvel superheroes but so far ve seen nothing but guess this is about shield and not the avengers joss whedon should have took totally different approach but will continue to watch with hopes that it will get better ', ' as an woman who identifies with carol danvers cried in every single moment that captain marvel showed she is determined powerful and worth just have to say one thing ignore the negative criticals and watch the movie now ', ' slow and dull show that drags on despite being very short everything looks so bleak the characters are so slow to do anything saw every episode from the first two seasons what waste of time ', ' wow have read some of the reviews here and gotta say you guys are nuts you cant even tell your own name without gagging on camera and saying this movie sucks get life movie was good and normally got bored quite easily come to your senses watching the movie from your small screens in your small rental houses and putting negative comments to good movies you dont know anything about cinema and talking about it all the time how cute ', ' it not good but it not bad acting is pretty good and scenes are good it definitely geared toward young girls the character itself is bit boring and m not sure how such an obscure character got it own show but then again guardians didn have well known characters either too much overt hate and love for this show it most definitely not anywhere near one of the best mcu movies tv but again it not the worst eternals has that badge of dishonor phase 4 really has been major letdown mcu has most likely peaked ', ' awesome in every way the greatest superhero series ve seen they could ve gone more seasons but the writers were perfect cast awesome villains scary as hell and overall one of the best series on netflix ', ' it kinda loses its impact hey m some guy from the internet and m here today to tell you all about why thought ms marvel was boring overlong and somewhat heavy handed no pun intended firstly the family drama doesn lead to relationship building or character development it just silly happenstances and contained mild interpersonal conflict all of which is resolved by the end of each hour long episode its like the mcu equivalent of modern sitcom based on family of immigrants the kind that has pun for title and pauses for laughter after every joke but not quite lowbrow enough to warrant laugh track the cinematography and fantasy elements are on par with your typical spielberg family romp but with slightly higher stakes and more self awareness all in all this show is very sincere and attempts with much success to convey the experience of young girl from an immigrant family attempting to navigate her social life and embrace her family more traditional cultural background unfortunately the pacing of the shows narrative story arc feels disjointed and out of tune with its presumably hyperactive teenage prospective audience an issue which pervades most of the mcu episodic forays on disney to date indeed pacing may be the biggest issue with almost every mcu film or streaming project due to their pedal to the metal tone and elaborate plots which are restructured with efficiency in mind to include easter eggs and fill out runtimes won stop watching mcu movies though as long as ones like doctor strange in the multiverse of madness and thor ragnarok keep popping up ', ' the acting is bad no all of this is bad would have someone stabbing me with knife instead of watching this who thought this is good idea seriously ', ' really enjoyed the masterpiece with the unique acting of john britnall who is really the only actor for this role really damn you netflix you are so stupid you cancel series like this then you continue every occupation until the last season really like this series enjoyed the unique acting the action is brutally beautiful and excellent in every sense m really jealous of you who haven seen this action series bertnal who surprises you with her amazing acting in every scene really in my opinion she should have received an emmy like charlie cox in the daredevil series who is really great ', ' it was just far too childish really feel this would do much better on something like disneyxd or nickelodean not really wanting such young audience targeted material as have to put up enough with teeny bop stuff on regular tv ', ' another disappointing marvel movie experience massive marvel fan from day one but this like the last thor movie very disappointing story line all over the place seems like they were just trying to hard to make it funny and exciting which made it cringy get what they were trying to do with it but definitely fell short not the actors fault but have to say they completely killed captain marvels character one minute toughest in the mcu next minute she is weak as one minute funny with bad jokes next trying to be serious m lost best part and most exciting part of the movie was the end credit scene hopefully taking us to the next and better parts of the mcu franchise ', ' truly raised the bar for the genre and had me hooked from the very first episode this marvel masterpiece delivered gritty and dark take on the iconic vigilante and it an absolute must watch for any fan of action drama and outstanding performances first and foremost the action scenes in daredevil are mind blowing the fight choreography is top notch and the hand to hand combat sequences are some of the best ve seen on tv the show realistic and intense approach to fight scenes makes you feel like you re right there in the action experiencing every punch kick and daring stunt charlie cox portrayal of matt murdock aka daredevil is tour de force he brings depth and vulnerability to the character making you empathize with the conflicted lawyer turned vigilante cox acting is so convincing that you can help but root for matt as he grapples with the moral dilemmas of his dual identity but let not forget about vincent onofrio portrayal of wilson fisk aka kingpin this is hands down one of the best villain performances in the superhero genre onofrio nuanced and menacing portrayal of fisk adds layer of complexity to the character making him one of the most captivating and formidable adversaries in the marvel universe the show dark and gritty tone is perfectly complemented by its superb cinematography and atmospheric visuals hell kitchen comes to life in all its gritty glory creating rich and immersive backdrop for the gripping narrative what sets daredevil apart is its willingness to explore complex and morally gray themes it delves into the darker aspects of vigilantism the cost of being hero and the fine line between justice and revenge the show doesn shy away from tackling difficult questions making it more than just run of the mill superhero series in conclusion daredevil is true gem in the superhero tv landscape the outstanding action scenes jaw dropping fight choreography and phenomenal acting elevate it to league of its own it a thrilling and emotionally charged ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish if you re fan of superhero stories with depth realism and heart pounding action daredevil is must watch trust me you won be disappointed ', ' this is the mcu solo star wars story film that didn need to be made as it beings nothing to the franchise not many people wanted and is just very poor fan service taskmaster as villain is wasted and pathetic the writing of the characters is very shallow especially natasha romanov who seems to have had her claws removed and the humour is forced and misplaced this is almost like second rate james bond knock off definitely not what we expect from marvel and rare mis step from kevin feige ', ' agents of h e d is promising action adventure series which according to radio times america is mad about friday nights are nothing special for me love to relax whilst watching an entertaining show on the tv however recently not many decent shows have been broad casted after viewing convincing trailer of the new series was persuaded into watching the first episode what saw surprised and delighted me this is fun quick paced edge of your seat thriller about heroes vs villains full of sharp twists and turns the characters are likable and while humour lacks in it for me the action is something to behold and cherish am looking forward to see where agents of h e d heads in the future episodes ', ' the avengers could tell you is the greatest film of our time or possibly the greatest came into this film with minor expectations after seeing the trailer but being comic book fan decided should give it go and mate this was one spectacular film done very well by joss whedon the man famous for putting together buffy the vampire slayer certainly knows how to write script with almost every line memorable and giving all the heroes chance to do something cool with nothing left out that could ruin the plot 2012 the avengers has done job well done the avengers iron man tony stark robert downey jr was at his very best performing with ease and actually thought he was cool in this chris hemsworth plays the norse god thor who was just awesome in this film and showed hawkeye played by jeremy renner did job well done especially with the arrow shots finally we found the perfect person to play the hulk bruce banner as mark ruffalo looks like nerd and doesn look angry in every scene like the other hulks and made the hulk look like cool guy rather than the others who took it like it was curse scarlett johansen improves from her kick ass performance in iron man 2 to become real person you would not want to make angry and proves to us she is in for more than just the good looks tom hiddelston pulled of our villain very well and if you though he was cool in thor he was even more cooler in this and probably the best villain since the dark knight we couldn forget samuel jackson who no longer appears just at the end for few minutes but finally brings together the avengers alan silvestri even pulled of great job with the soundtrack and could dare say it was better than what he had for back to the future well it was wayy better than the back to the future soundtrack and never thought would say that the avengers is just the greatest film everr 11 out of 10 ', ' big meh have to add more because its too short but that how short this movie came up ', ' love the storyline when it comes to the family story always couldn take it felt lot pain from the fighting scenes ', ' of all the titles netflix has especially in this genre this was 1 of the better ones that they stopped iron fist and the punisher understand but daredevil was really nice to watch well maybe to end on high anywayz liked daredevil and gave it 9 out of 10 just to tease netflix when judge it honestly would award it 8 ish ', ' rated 7 10 language english another marvel hero beginning story its filled with good amount of fun and action not boring one but not exceptional also worth the watch ', ' have just finished watching marvel jessica jones series and overall would say it is pretty good series personally found netflix daredevil series better rounded but that is just my opinion jessica jones is the ultimate female bad ass which is an element that has been notably lacking from the superhero world of late jessica is an alcoholic butt kicking anti hero who is extremely intriguing to watch one of the best things about the show is her unpredictability which often gets her in lot of trouble all of the actors in the series are absolutely superb and over the course of the show the audience becomes very connected to each character however the antagonist kilgrave portrayed by david tennant is phenomenal tennant performance is truly amazing and made the series incredibly interesting kilgrave himself was very peculiar character as you never knew whether he was in cat and mouse game with jessica to test her or because he did in his own sadistic way love jessica the show writing is clever and witty and plays off very well with the cast that have been selected it seems the story had been thought through clearly and as result was excellently presented towards the end of the series it felt like the substance was stretching and for me the final confrontation between jessica and kilgrave was little bit anti climatic other than this jessica jones is an absolutely fantastic series and would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves gritty unpredictable and refreshingly tv ', ' cannot tell you how exciting the last half of this season of shield has been can wait for tuesday to see what happens next was thinking of stopping this show because the first half of the season and ghost rider was bit of bore but man did they turn it around with the second half the best of shield yet and worthy of watch as good as it gets for network tv ', ' the avengers first of all is good movie while sometimes overlong it entertaining and the action scenes are amazing however it doesn have enough depth to be another one of those classic superhero films the reputation instead should be enjoyable superhero flick first off if an effort is made to assemble all of marvel avengers that effort must be made with little more success than this the avengers ends up feeling like more sequel than spin off instead of studying and developing each character if we re supposed to care about all these superheroes give them noticeable differences more display of emotions and distinctive background just because they re superheroes who have some funny one liners doesn mean the viewers will automatically think they re the best people who ever lived in other words the characters have too little depth something that bugs me is that few people have been saying this is better than christopher nolan batman trilogy yet the latter is perfect example of series of films that have greatly influenced and perhaps even transcended the superhero genre in the dark knight there wasn a single character who was just there for nothing meanwhile loki is an uninteresting villain and doesn hold candle to heath ledger disturbing brilliant portrayal of the joker who on the other hand actually seems like villain even when he just not doing anything how come the avengers all have to work to defeat loki and his army while hulk can simply toss him around like plastic spoon that said the long action sequence where the assembled avengers all defeat loki army is quite outstanding and many detractors of this film admit that this is also the best part it contains amazing cinematography like minute long shot that steadily observes each avenger and sees how they re doing with the aliens of course the rest of the action scenes are also top notch considering there fighting for most of the movie the sequence with black widow running away from the hulk is especially memorable and displays arguably the most likable avenger here along with iron man the two that we care the most about overall d say that the avengers could have been cut about 20 30 minutes short to flow more as superhero film had hoped for more character development since there were so many characters to pay attention to loved the action and was pleased with the clever action scenes especially the last 40 minutes and the parts with black widow it undeniably entertaining and while it not transcendent and genius it a great popcorn flick would see it again yes but not my 1 priority ', ' foreword if you happen to be young single male with an intellect lower than jam doughnut you will have only seen the 5 star rating and pressed dislike but if you re person with an iq higher than chicken sandwich press that like button it all started off so well was hooked fan rooting for frank castle the punisher and then like most tv shows the writers didn know what to do with it so here is the good and the bad of this show the action scenes are fantastic when they happen frank castle is awesome when it comes to fight stand back john wick frank is in town frank has incredible healing abilities we need some of this for covid 19 more often than not frank goes from looking like he has been run through combine harvester to fully healed few days later and lastly the list could go on how did curtis hoyle get the accolade expert marksman with pistols and sniper rifles season 2 episode 10 what the bloody hell judge for yourself when he is shooting from the roof top perhaps the writers forgot curtis is supposed to be an expert shot all in all the series appears to be aimed at young single males with relatively low intellect it isn too bad but it certainly isn great very much like the latest john wick movie evidenced by my the heavy use of the fast forward button it a shame really as the punisher was better in the tv series daredevil ', ' watched this movie after reading the reviews it seems many of the reviewers give it too much like the fight and the jokes are goods but the story is not what have expected as great movie where are the army and jetfighters when aliens attack after only fighting for less than an hour and they suddenly launch nuclear missile how come the avengers were very easy to gather each other in the battlefield in large city alrite ironman can fly and they should add independence day fighting to create great massive fight against the alien and all of the aliens are dead after the host were blown up that was too easy the dark knight were ten times better than this but give this 7 out of 10 for the jokes and the acting ', ' this honestly was mediocre at best the humour was forced and not that good and don get me started on the action purely fantastical it doesn even make any sense ', ' by bad representation mean constant smiling face of kamala khan presenting every muslim as traditional person except kamala and most of all fabricated accent of kamala mother mean no pakistani or indian talks like that kamala father talks normally but there is some problem with the mother she is an american and she is trying to sound south asian and that too so poorly is bit frustrating for us ', ' hate this show because she says her powers are light base instead of what it supposed to be it was supposed to be like mr fantastic powers instead they say bracelet give her powers and that her powers are light based it is absolutely horrible when her powers aren given by bracelet and they didn even mention the inhumane worst series ever ', ' everything is too perfect not only is every single part of the production done extremely well they all coalesce synergizing it into product that is evermore exquisite breathtaking hysterical inspiring and even contemplative of ageless questions of morality justice and duty the script the casting the action scenes the relationships the origin and back story the dialog the acting everything is done exquisitely after watching few episodes get the feeling like everyone involved in the entire production is really pouring everything they have into it truly hope that everyone is honorably recognized for all their hardwork dedication and talent needless to say also desperately hope that following seasons will be given to continue documenting their continued achievement and excellence ', ' it is bothersome we live in day and age where politics play so much into movie feel this may be reason why there are so many negative reviews brie larson was good quirky and lit up the screen now did not appreciate some rants she made off screen but that did not affect my movie going experience was afraid that they were going to try to shove feminism down my throat but it was very even tempered in that respect the visuals were pretty cool especially the space scenes in 3d the retro equipment used took me back in time and the plot was not obvious it was decent origin film seriously don know where some of these hostile reviews are coming from m conservative male and did not find anything wrong with the film found it to be entertaining which is what film is supposed to do just enjoy the ride ', ' people giving this 1 lol 1 is the lowest rating if you give this 1 where do you go for something that actually terrible crazy this movie rocks it has great casting awesome action all the feels highly recommended whole family watched together at home big screen age range 11 to 64 and everyone loved it ', ' think this is the best action series ever you can see only the fight scenes it suuppppeer ', ' m honestly surprised that they represented our culture in good way and handled it perfectly and beautifully do not know who are the writers directors and the crew but what do know is that by far it beyond amazing as pakistani woman m proud to be represented in positive way by western media ', ' writer seems more about pushing politics than store line seems to be going for different crowed not true to marvel fans what let down ', ' what is the story line very first marvel movie bought and wish could return it waste of my money boring to put it bluntly sorry will not trust any more marvel movies until see it on regular tv and see it before buy it there is nothing of real interest except wasting people time was planning to take my grandkids to see this m glad didn they were not even interested in going to the movies for free guess they had inside information before knew what was buying must always review what others are saying on all social apps dc you really have loser with this production ', ' joss whedon really delivered with this movie there was more action and comedy than you can wish for wrapped in superhero movie after 5 movies the superheroes from marvel finally assemble in this two and half hour long roller coaster of fun all the actors do an amazing job in bringing their characters alive especially mark ruffalo as bruce banner does great job robert downey junior has become his character by now tom hiddleston has grown as loki and the rest of the superheroes give solid performances only scarlett johansson could improve in the comedy department but it is partly the fault of the writers for giving her unfunny jokes johansson makes up for it in the action part though if you are fan of superhero movies and probably even if you aren the avengers is recommendation for you ', ' have gold turn to rubbish then have seen rubbish turned to gold this is neither this rubbish turned to worse this is whole new level of boring fake unimaginative poor screen writing the worse is that the producer hopes that the viewer is to stupid to realise that the it crap covered in blood worst show have seen other than daredevil which is easily the biggest load of rubbish ever ', ' whilst really loved the new netflix series maniac the punnisher starts off slow then builds to become powerhouse of glorious revenge the acting is superb gore is great better than both movies that were released previously waiting for hellboy series if it ever arrives ', ' the marvels is very rough around the edges but it is also consistently fun thanks to iman vellani kamala her family and some seriously cute alien cats that are worth the price of admission alone it has very weak villain and the movie does feel very choppy and rushed at times but at the same time its frenetic pace and its trio of main characters make sure that you are never bored and you forgive the movie many weaknesses it not sensational high pedigree comic book cinema that the mcu might need right now but it does its job in entertaining you and sometimes that enough watch it for the characters more than anything also the credits scene opens up new possibilities for the mcu and consider me excited ', ' went and watched this film with open mind and without watching the trailer and am wondering weather should have understood nothing and eventually ended up walking out with less of the knowledge as when went in poor poor performance and little or no character description ', ' literally the most underrated show of all time animation is 8 10 voice acting is 10 10 story 10 10 plot 10 10 characters 10 10 cinematography 10 10 almost every scene of hitmonkey can become wallpaper and ending 9 10 only because rly didnt expect that ending and it kinda felt weird iterally peak television go watch it right now im bout to watch the 1st season second time because holy crap was it good god the pilot was just chefs kiss hopefully one day it becomes popular to the point ppl will make toys for him bryce basically the whole crew loved every single bit of this show and cannot wait for season 2 ', ' unlike most of the people who claimed they hated it without watching it all the way through did and it isn as horrible as people say it is was it an oscar winning series with amazing acting and mind blowing graphics no was it cute delightful and entertaining sure it was nice seeing different cultures and as young immigrant woman myself it was nice to see another immigration story the show was nice and it does have some cheesy moments but it good quirky inner monolauges real life family dynamics between mother and teenage daughter think like turning red uncovering family history and crazy love triangle so if you re into cute cheesy culturally interesting shows then go ahead and skip the negative comments left by people who didn even watch it all and watch the show it less than 10 episodes you ll knock it out in weekend know everyone is caught up with stranger things so if you want to give it go go for it ', ' enjoyed this series particularly the evolving relationship between kamala and her mom as well as the history of the partition and the cultural components that were woven into the story thought the writers did skilled job in merging kamala challenges as teen her muslim background and her families struggles with the superhero elements of the story kamala is likable character and down to earth and goofy superhero who is initially does not excel with her powers the heart and depth of the show is what elevates it above some of the other marvel series released in 2022 and for once the main character has 2 intact parents neither of which abandoned kamala or died when she was young which is rare in superhero story ', ' dear disney marvel could you do us favor and stop making superhero movies for about decade this one only holds up by 21 o imami who seems to be the only one who actually wants to work for her paycheck brie larson once again proofs she nothing more than pretty face with acting skills to cry about samuel jackson is only there because his contract says so the man is obviously tired of playing nick fury but hey it pays the bills the story as always is all over the place apparently that a thing since the avengers spiderman no way home to be the exception the jokes aren well timed and the actors do not have chemistry at all in short just another cash cow for specific audience who is obviously inspired by social media since focusing on true story is to difficult ', ' didn expect anything walking into this movie and m really happy didn hype myself up for it think the biggest problem is that this is movie that should have come out before endgame we already know what happens to natasha and really the only reasons this movie exists is 1 fan service tribute to natasha and 2 to set up yelena as the next black widow if they even do that the acting was fine the characters were meh yelena stole the show in my opinion best character but think this movie wasn necessary and brought nothing to the table don even think this is good send off movie for nat it left me just feeling empty and don remember 90 percent of what nat does in the film and it supposed to be movie about her don like what they did with taskmasker or that they made nat and yelena adopted sisters sister figures in the comics they aren related at all and don see each other that way but hey that my opinion glad some people got enjoyment ', ' ve watched the movie yesterday evening in the theatre and have to say that it is way better than the average review here on imdb makes you think it is it probably not the best marvel movie but it is definitely enjoyable and never had the feeling of being bored while watched it it has good story its funny moments and nice action scenes and that is what expect from marvel movie ', ' starts amazingly and gets surprisingly better every season when the bar is already quite high great characters amazing castings brilliant script and great execution no other superhero series or most other series can match the standards this series has set ', ' personally loved the first episodes but then it started really slowing down they mishandled some episodes the focus was shifting all the time and the side characters didnt have enough time to shine the last episode was the best imo and saved the show of course iman vellani stole the show with her charm and attitude really want to see her in the next captain marvel movie because think she has lots to offer and evolve into the mcu overall good show with flaws but still fun give us more ms marvel m officially fan ', ' they screwed the pooch on punisher yet again remember back in the 80s when studios had balls remember when good movies mean really good movies spread through word of mouth and not an overexposed internet hype this series has nothing to do with the punisher from marvel comics they should ve called it the frank castle show cause all he does it go around as frank castle and feel sorry for himself including waay to long scene where he hammers brick wall to pieces which is suppose to be metaphor for therapy the problem is there almost no punisher in the entire 13 ep series it mostly frank castle going round being grumpy and broody they ve also changed the whole background story now it not the mob anymore who responsible for killing his family now it was all part of military cover up involving cia and homeland security micro has been turned into skinny drinking snivelling paranoid weirdo who stalks his family through hidden cams in their house and is somehow involved in the same cover up that suppose to have cost frank castle family their lives and punisher castle suddenly need help to get guns it makes we wonder if the people behind this ever read single one of the comics punisher only punishes himself the action is mediocre at best most of the episodes doesn even have action heck death wish 4 is more of punisher flick than this crap season two is just as bad as season 1 there is way to much drama and not enough killing first off punisher castle was retried green beret yet here he goes into the most stupid ambushes act like an amateur he goes up against people who out class him in hand to hand combat something the comix version never did everything that made the punisher the pro he was in the comix is stripped away he hates him self he don protect the innocent which is totally unlike the charter he is based up on he rushes head first into everything that could get him killed forget planing who needs that right they have turned marwels coolest character into soap opera bet in the next season they be singing and dancing after netflix has turned it into musical cause the have figured out that is cheaper to produce ', ' can expect this from marvel movie bad story line bad acting bad cgi movie seems ok in first half but second half totally waste ', ' is this the worst thing made in marvel no is it the best thing marvel made no is it an enjoyable movie yes although it can be messy from time to time it still good popcorn flick film ', ' hooked from the start this series was absolutely cracking jon bernthal gives heroic performance as the punisher m not sure there is anyone else who could have filled this role well done to the casting team ', ' had to turn it off 10 minutes into the first episode really tried to give this chance and went back to finish the first two episodes and they re just so bad the acting is pure cheese which put down to the writing as the actors themselves are doing the best they can with what they ve got to work with this is the first piece of marvel ll be avoiding which is shame but m sure whatever movie ms marvel ends up in will give quick recap of what she about this is pretty much made for kids so hopefully they ll enjoy it ', ' when the world is threatened by loki who determined to bring an army of evil doers to earth couple of superheroes are gathered together in order to form team and defeat the upcoming invasion the only thing that apparently stand in the way is their ego each one of them having an idea of his own while teamwork is word which apparently they don understand it a movie which features great invasion of earth while ironman thor captain america and couple of others must fight back to defeat it and at the same time struggle to work together as team it one of those movies which amazes through its visuals presents good but overused plot in which marvel superheroes show off their powers while saving the world as said before it looks astonishing the characters are well described and put into picture also very well played by their actors the fighting sequences are top notch and almost everything is very good of course except the plot which simply wasn enough to make it masterpiece it is good enough to make such movie entertaining and sustainable but not good enough to make it truly great like these kind of movies where very popular characters with superpowers fight their way through saving the world but it tends to be bit boring to see how the world is attacked by not so impressive force of evil this time led by loki very well played but not so impressive as villain over and over again oh and as result the ending is very predictable something with bit more depth could have helped lot in terms of story yes they tried to add bit of additional suspense and even comedy through their opposing characters almost making them fight each other but it isn enough from my point of view to make it truly great movie overall it a must see for marvel fans for superhero fans and for everyone looking to have good time you won be disappointed by any aspect of it just don expect breath taking plot as there won be one ', ' there was no secret of the highly populated cast in the lead up to the avengers taking into account the hype since the release of iron man in 2008 the success of iron man was followed by sequel in 2010 fans of the super hero franchise where greeted with the release of two more comic book movies thor and captain america the question was could the avengers succeed as whole nick fury jackson recruits iron man downey jr thor hemsworth and captain america evans as well as newcomer mark ruffalo as the hulk the super group also consists of two newbies to the big screen black widow is played scarlett johansson and jeremy renner as hawkeye the next bourne the world is under threat following the arrival of loki citizen of asgard another universe thor 2011 loki is the brother of thor although both would agree the distance between them is not exaggerated it is loki attack on h e d that leads to crucial decision by nick fury leader of the affiliation the desperate attempt involves regrouping something stronger than loki and his army of cohorts the avengers the movie has nice feel to it with brilliant intro of what to come those who have not seen previous movies won suffer too much but it does consist of some flashbacks regarding captain america the storyline is put together smartly and manages to keep the balance in relation to the numerous egos on board as loki is the one at large it feels the story is based off of thor but does well in blending all characters as always robert downey shows class as the arrogant yet hilarious tony stark and the ever so cheesy captain america evans fans will enjoy the rivalry between both captain america and iron man as personalities quickly collide before they realize the moral of the story is team work the return of loki was great choice as he made for terrific bad guy in thor and the collision between family is still fun to watch although loki seemed handful in the release of thor in 2010 nick fury and the avengers get caught completely off guard with loki and his mind boggling army the introduction of third bruce banner is unfortunately frustrating for some but when the hulk is transformed nobody notices yes third mark ruffalo plays the man with the temper following eric bana and edward norton my favorite by the way mark ruffalo as dr banner had challenge on his hands is there information on why edward norton was not included instead believe if he was performance on the bases of acting would have been better than mark ruffalo but just like said in relation to the avengers fans just want to see the hulk tear people buildings and valuable things apart and that is just what he does my favorite was bruce banner when he was green my knowledge in marvel limits but wonder what fans made of hawk eye and black widow both characters like the rest were highly entertaining jeremy renner is leading an exciting future and scarlett johansson well just do what you do best not forgetting samuel jackson even though he has been forgettable in the past he gives fans an enjoyable performance curse free mr jackson just needs to choose his movies carefully in my opinion he has been in some woeful movies lately the action and cgi makes the avengers what it is in comparison to captain america which despised and even the previous cgi hulk this blows them out of the water you noticed excluded both the iron man and thor movies the avengers is still early release and is yet to be decided in my opinion the avengers is up there with the greatest super hero movies ever made audience from generations will enjoy the avengers whether you are unfortunate to see this movie in 3d or stay classy with 2d one must see immediately the exciting question for the future is what is next to come well we know iron man 3 and thor sequel is in writing unfortunately captain america also and possibly new bruce banner who knows in relation to an avengers sequel now that getting carried away did you enjoy my review check out my previous and up to date reviews at my blog http gerrysreviewsforthosecurious blogspot com ', ' the only thing good in the series are the featured music not even sfx is on point includes each and every disgusting thing you could ever find in series ', ' avengers assemble great crossover off the superhero ', ' congratulations very few movies get 5 or below from me and this is one of them normally film gets 7 if consider it ok 8 if d watch it again and 6 if think it sub par very few get anything but 6 7 or 8 this year police state taylor swift the eras tour and mission impossible dead reckoning part one got 9 and the great escaper got 10 the last time anything got 5 was black panther wakanda forever 2022 what can say about this movie first of all rather unconvincing villain with plan that unfolds in rather undramatic way carol danvers aka captain marvel teams up with carol estranged niece captain rambeau and super fan kamala khan aka ms marvel ms marvel has newly acquired powers they get proficient as team surprisingly fast there plenty of fights and space vistas who doing what is not always obvious the only amusing bit was with the kitties you ll see can see repairing rift in space and time like it crocheted together as really convincing so it quite spectacle but with rather weak plot ', ' being south asian and always biased towards anything asian in hollywood watched this but it was just bad the actor who plays kamala is so bad m sure there are so many other younger girls who would have done better job joining her in bad acting is her mother just awful how is this even marvel quality expect much more when it the marvel universe ', ' am going to be vague on the plot and focus on writing style used for this series if it isn the story being moved forward by mcguffins its because of plot setups hey we need reason to move to point and haven written connection lets have someone walk into the scene with the answer and people will buy it and lets not get into the fact that this show focus on strong female characters that are constantly the weak link did the bad guy get away yup because woman was all womanly it seems like anytime they need something to go wrong to further the plot they have one of the many female characters be the cause of it and lets get into the inconsistencies with jessica powers she goes from invincible superhero to weak human whenever the plot requires it and the worst part is the backstory is so in depth and there are scenes that are so moving that it almost makes up for it in all honesty if they removed the superhero aspects and just wrote it as noir crime series it would be perfect but superhero must equal super stupid ', ' such shame after the good shows up to this point cannot watch it anymore its just boring rubbish story come on marvel dont slip into the depth of making lack luster series please ', ' that changed today forget about worst marvel movie ever it clears that hurdle by leagues no this is contender for the worst mega budget big studio theatrically released film ever made the tone veers from painfully unfunny attempts at slapstick humor to terribly acted this is most serious threat the world has ever faced moments that aim for gravitas but miss by miles and sometimes these ridiculous tonal shifts occur in the same scene nothing makes sense nothing and that the first 45 minutes before had enough and left the theater and demanded refund can believe this script got greenlight let alone 300 million budget speaking of which where on this earth did all that money go it certainly is not up on the screen as this is some of the worst cgi have ever seen movies made in the 90s look thousand times better than this catastrophe keep reading articles about why this movie is going to fail and they all got it wrong three incomprehensibly unlikable leads nonsensical script and woefully incompetent director are why this movie is such failure the reviews that say this film is bad are wrong but it not the critic fault it just that human language hasn evolved word strong enough to describe just how awful it truly is can still smell the stink of it on my clothes ', ' ve just finished watching season 2 and m so glad that jones is back she is just so much real and more human and still awesome than every other superhuman like daredevil must say that she is my favrite amongst all the others luke cage etc won even mention iron fist because he is just so zzzz ', ' brie larson was very poor casting for this role she is equally boring and annoying instead of being powerful superhero she comes across as someone pretending to be badass and what they did to nick fury was awful instead of battle hardened soldier he is useless and whiny zero tie in to the current mcu recommend skipping this film was had ', ' the characters writing action cinematography lighting plot etc are all so amazing even if you re not daredevil fan but still comic book fan you will still love this show it had an interesting story an amazing intro great acting excellent writing phenomenal music and outstanding choreography the fight scenes were just epic daredevil series is different from the ones that we have seen till now and it will remain to be one of the best series that have ever seen and also assure you that this one won disappoint you ', ' great action and strong acting the stories between the 2 seasons were compelling and its shame we wont get to see what the future would hold for it but what was made was very enjoyable ', ' for fans of the comic books it a dream come true for die hard action fans it something you have never been prepared for the sheer special effects and solid script work effortlessly and make this film work two characters feel carry this film iron man captain america the two have male ego problems conflict of moralities and this can be seen in the film have given rating of 10 for special effects and script there are some actors that would have sunk this film if not for the majority of decent acting by both robert downey jr chris evans and samuel jackson for once in his life chris hemsworth does not ck it up the liabilities in this film are jeremy renner scarlett johansson mark ruffalo but they just merely cause dent in the armour nothing more before you see this film you should already have seen iron man 1 2 the hulk the incredible hulk captain america the first avenger and thor this will give you background into these characters plot nick fury is director of h e d an international peace keeping agency the agency is who who of marvel super heroes with iron man the incredible hulk thor captain america hawkeye and black widow when global security is threatened by loki and his cohorts nick fury and his team will need all their powers to save the world from disaster other superhero theme movies the flash the flash ii revenge of the trickster the meteor man 1993 man 1986 robocop trilogy the vindicator revenge of the radioactive reporter ', ' daredevil turned out to be big surprise for me or rather the rating did when was done with the first season watched the whole season in disbelief knowing that the series was rated just shy of 9 out of 10 intrigued by what it is that people find so amazing about this show unfortunately reading through the first couple of pages of reviews did not give me the answer they are all shallow and hardly critical don get me wrong m not trying to say that daredevil is complete garbage keeping that in mind ll start with the positives was beginning to feel tired of the superhero movies with all the fancy sci fi stuff lot of shooting and big explosions so daredevil was welcome change in this aspect its dark mood and gritty look at the life in hell kitchen was what pulled me in the highlight of the show are the remarkable choreography and the wonderful cinematography of the fight scenes you finally get to see whole sequences of impressive fighting in contrast to the fight scenes that are prevalent in most movies these days having cut twice second and being zoomed in so much that it actually left for your imagination to conceive what is going on but that amazement also wears off and the action scenes become repetitive and inevitably boring we also see the hero failing and getting beaten up badly which makes him more real and relatable on another note appreciate there were no gratuitous sex scenes which are also painfully common in all genres of movies nowadays but then the male female relationships were really laughable and to conclude the list of things liked about the series the episode intro was well done and liked the theme music otherwise there was nothing memorable about the soundtrack now let me get to what think is wrong with the series m not going to say the story is unoriginal because know it hard to come up with something new and compelling at the same time plus the majority of the storyline was probably determined by the comic book it was based on anyway the plot really is uninteresting though it reminded me of countless crime movies that had seen before there was lack of suspense and it was overall highly predictable moreover the story flows incredibly slowly it picks up the pace and becomes somewhat thrilling in about two thirds of the season by then you might get tired of the lame antagonist though who elicits no fear nor respect that perhaps because we aren given the background on how he actually became the kingpin and what exactly it is he does besides selling few buildings for drug business purposes and thus evicting their inhabitants he merely keeps claiming that it is his dream to do something good for the city which the public applauds for some reason although we never learn what the dream is couldn help but think of sherlock holmes and dr watson every time saw matt murdock and foggy nelson only they had much worse chemistry between them in fact there were no likable characters there who d actually care for know this is somewhat subjective except for maybe claire who only appeared in three or four episodes couldn even bring myself to root for the hero m not sure whether it was due to bad acting or poor scripting direction either way most of the characters were extremely dull and their development was almost non existent as for the hero it took me some time to get over the incredibility of what he could do despite being blind his merely enhanced senses and hard training would hardly suffice he would need at least some kind of sonar to perform parkour and fighting as he does nevertheless it a superhero show so swallowed that down however it gets really irritating when the hero has no problem hearing voices on police radios in their cars halfway across the city yeah among all the other noise that his enhanced hearing would inevitably yield but doesn hear the sirens of the police cars just around the corner closing in on him and seems surprised moment later when there are dozen cops aiming their guns at him after beating up man oh and did mention that the hero always appears just in time to save the day one last thing before wrap it up have nothing against graphic realism but there is some really gratuitous violence in this series such as guy having his head smashed with car door for 25 seconds until it was separated from the rest of his body seriously guess watched the season to the end hoping for thrilling and unexpected ending that would at least partially justify the high rating of the series well that was foolish of me it makes me sad that shows like this get all the popularity while others such as jessica jones which think was significantly more suspenseful consistent and thought provoking noir series from the marvel universe with an extraordinary villain have an uncertain future ', ' updated june 20 have bumped my original rating to 5 due to the actors its becuase of them this show got any stars without them this show would be 0 think the writing is garbage along with cgi like said very disney channel vide for those who thought this could transcend age they are mistaken this is show meant for kids in particular those who are in grade school kinda like saved by the bell but whereas that show had wider range of ages groups watching ms marvel is hard to watch for anyone over 16 as said this is clear dsiney channel show meant for that type of audience the plot character development and cgi have demonstrated that this belongs in the same category as hannah montana will it find an audience maybe but for those who are invested in comics this is let down the main actress does fine job have no complaints same with the supporting cast but honestly the writing is just garbage writing brought this show down to 3 stars along with the cgi ', ' whats wrong with people giving bad reviews without even see the movie we really enjoyed it the music is amazing brie samuel and the rest of the cast rock ', ' the punisher gritty symphony of violence and vengeance that had me hooked from the first skull emblazoned bullet jon bernthal portrayal of frank castle is masterclass in brooding intensity wounded antihero navigating the shadows with brutal finesse the film editing slices through the narrative like castle through criminals sharp and relentless strengths lie in its unapologetic exploration of trauma morality and the blurred lines between hero and villain weaknesses perhaps few narrative detours that felt like taking scenic route in city of chaos but they add depth to castle tortured psyche the music thunderous soundtrack is the war drums echoing in the heart of the series underscoring every bone crushing fight cinematography paints dark atmospheric backdrop canvas for the punisher brutal ballet the message justice isn always clean and heroes are often born from the ashes of tragedy 8 10 is nod to its unrelenting power series that doesn just explore the darkness but immerses you in it leaving you questioning the blurred lines between right and wrong long after the credits roll ', ' the marvel studios have lost the plot with this one it dreadful in every conceivable way the story plot is mushy and isn really in keeping with the original ethos of marvel comics studios the only good thing about this tv series is it has lots of bright oversaturated colour ', ' technically speaking black widow is poorly directed the action sequences don flow and are often visually confusing regarding the writing it predictable formulaic and contrived with flat characterizations and many uses of deus ex machina important characters are not true to their original comic book counterparts overall disappointing movie clearly made by committee ', ' daredevil stands apart from other comic based super hero series running on television by being notch better in almost every department its darker than the other similar series in being gorier the martial arts used is way superior the action sequences are great the cast have been great at their roles from the first episode without needing time to settle in the plot has been solid all throughout the three seasons without any silly fillers or wasted episodes season one introduces us to matt murdock the daredevil he is played by charlie cox who is great at this portrayal the supporting cast also give us great performances with lot of screen time given to the bad guy wilson fisk who is played by vincent onofrio while like the screen time given for development of the bad guy just didn like the fat man characteristic for boss villain don have much of comics background so came in without any fan expectation or buildup on the arc villain know as kingpin wilson fisk the character was the only disappointment for me in season one the action choreography for the season was just awesome did feel the ending to be lackluster but it kind of added to the series in building the storyline for the future 9 10 season two just blew me away with the introduction of two superb characters and their journey jon bernthal as punisher and elodie yung as elektra the show just became more gory fun complex entertaining the first few episodes on punishers dealing out mayhem took violence to another level then the introduction of elektra and her history with matt and her demands on his time puts new angle his relationship with his partners at the office this season is not about the final fight with an evil bad guy it does have that but more about characters exploring their life what they want to be where they want to go its more about the relationship between all our favorite characters 10 10 season three starts where the series defenders ended we get to see how daredevil escaped from the fight of his life the series gets back to the original players from season one the focus is on daredevil his friends and associates the old fan favorite bad guy wilson fisk makes comeback also the introduction of another nemesis who can go blow for blow with daredevil only adds to the dynamic powerplay one can expect to materialize all throughout the season daredevil questions his purpose in life his belief in god which had kept him going is bought into question season three looks and feels like the original season one although it starts off slow it ends it with bang plenty of action great action choreography and tight plotting make it great watch 9 10 real sad such good show is canceled due to corporate greed ', ' see the reviews and honestly thought it might have been bit hyped good but not great right its tv tv rarely scores great cause there is just too many episodes to balance the budget and coast along for the profits but the punisher is not one of them m writing this after seeing season 1 frankly as is its done deal everything finishes nicely why watch second season after the near perfect performance of the first only to go down from here like most squeals right well guess m going to find out soon there is that cliff hanger lets just hope its not money grab season but if the other reviews have anything to suggest about it think m in for some more great edit just finished the second season start off little rough kinda got to more traditional tv start kinda though the prequel was not going to be the same but it builds up and finishes well do like the first season better the second is definitely good enough for third about that third ', ' not that great maybe good as tv show and for the time it came for the first season the brief for the sound designer was to copy the music of the dark knight ', ' the plot was weak and we have seen much better actions for natasha in other marvel movies in short natasha was main character in avengers movies and she deserved better ', ' it was better than expected especially after suffering through in theater trailers for movies have no interest in seeing florence pugh performance was noteworthy and look forward to seeing even more in the future just wish this movie had been made released sooner it seemed little bit out of order compared to the other mcu films ', ' am from india think daredevil season 3 is so great and favorite episode is four prison fight seen is super and emotion playing between characters is wonderful am eagerly waiting for season 4 ', ' very much loved season one and can believe was waiting for this for three years during season one cared about all the characters and the stories however season 2 is extremely weak as much as wanted to didn care about any of the characters and any of the stories the show was extremely slow the protagonist and the antagonist never had clear goal for more than couple of episodes and they were not goals cared about trish and malcolm became so annoying and loved them the previous season the only exception to all this is jerry but her story just didn seem like part of this show more like standalone just can point to single thing that liked in season 2 had to watch it in fast forward after few episodes just so don drop it really hope they get proper writers for next season only give it 6 10 because of season 1 otherwise it would be 1 10 ', ' get the cultural diversity although forced like everything nowadays forced down our throats but mon didney first episode and already with woke t and lgtvhdr innuendos and imagery ffs you can write good intro but decide to bloat it with stupid references and bad writing it audience being kids as expected disney feels like its expanding its grooming tactics parents beware it all about making more money and attracting more customers they don care about your history or about the marvel legacy ', ' this show was great from start to finish cant wait for the new season ', ' this tv show is aimed towards specific audience and it will make you feel alienated don really see anything worth watching here but know certain audiences will find it very appealing ', ' this is not the punisher from dare devil that was expecting so far this series has been such huge disappointment 5 episodes in am struggling to get through the series which focuses on supporting characters and the emotional fragility of frank castle the punisher is very limited and vulnerable both physically and mentally far cry from the character depicted in the comics this series could easily just be action drama about marine who suffers from ptsd fell asleep three times in the last two episodes ', ' for show where the main character doesn speak it really darn funny bryce the assassin really pokes fun at the situation and monkey is ice cold kewl the plot schemes are mix of serious drama and downright wtf outrageous which means couldn stop watching an unexpected marvel anime that has my two thumbs up this one a quick binge and at the end you ll be wanting more of the craziness enjoy ', ' the storyline is often times confusing and not well told it is wrapped up on too many cultural studies without any actual concrete plot to progress it don feel like there actually anything at stake here mean moon knight could based their story on egyptian culture and did just fine characters just come and go the acting is noticibly mediocre the editing team is the only one carrying this show ', ' am not normally fan of blood and guts but the role of punisher was flawlessly acted you really believe that this is man on mission after devastating loss the storyline is engrossing and the characters believable wouldn make the same decisions as all of them but the story arc does good job of building case for why people behave the way they do extremely well done ', ' im not into the franchise in big way but as each movie is made and the budgets get bigger suppose we are always looking to be blown away with effects and such like but have to say this wasnt great in my opinion the russian accents by some of the cast were awful and the film wasnt entertaining in anyway drawn out and slow sorry to upset the fans for this ', ' there weren any big revelations in the story but it a good action movie the symbolism was nice enjoyed the girl power aspect of it but wish the father figure alexei the red guard had some better moments and more memorable lines m glad it wasn as gritty as feared could watch it again ', ' this movie perfectly deals with the past 6 avengers that have either made cameos in movies or had movies developing there backstory personality and morals this movies takes those characters and creates huge conflict between themselves and makes the characters flaws and later skills much much more clearer the movie gives each character good amount of screen time and makes you care for them and be interested to watch them grow and succeed the villain is also amazing as he is extremely funny and very clever by using each avengers weakness against them and the team making the team fight each other causing good action and good story telling the movie is relatively simple story in the long run but it is still perfectly made funny and has great characters that are all given some form of development ', ' this movie might have been worth my time if the director had spent sliver of his time focusing on something beside obvious comedic quips blind person could have seen every part of this movie from 200 miles away oh wait never mind we have the awesome character hawk eye to do that for us whips out his bow and looks like little child compared to iron man and thor and the hulk at this time im laughing and wondering why he was ever written as character as well as what is this random red headed woman doing in here either perhaps am being harsh not lot of the blame is on the director himself its just 6 utterly awful annoying type characters that all need the camera time of full movie to be cool coming together in one movie tired together annoyingly by an awful samuel jackson character and with such little background explaining so many twists in the plot look now m running around in my sentences literally am lost in trying to combine all the horrendous things about this movie into one review perhaps if wrote more reviews d be better at this anyways thank god for the saving grace of over accomplishing graphics allowing me to see how sweet the hulk can really be otherwise would ve given this one oh just while its on my mind jessica alba plays better supporting female chick than scarlett johansen would write more about the utter expletive of this movie but in order to do that d have to watch it again to remind me of all the little expletive despised and frankly don wanna waste my money doing that besides am tired from staying up for this midnight showing anyways so disappointed this movie couldn be as sweet as the spider man preview saw 5 minutes before it ', ' this show has been all over the net with stuff about how good it is and how you must see it well tried the pilot and it sucks rather watch paint dry at least then something happens you are suppose to feel sympathy with the main character cause she has ptsd and drinks heavily but after 10 min you realize you don really care about anything about her the women is flat out boring she has one facial expression all the time like so many other of today young actors what disappointed me the most aside from the choice of actress for the lead was that the pilot story is just dull and boring the pilot is supposed to hook you in make you wanna watch the rest not claw your eyes out hope to god daredevil season 2 is way better ', ' what should say movie is too slow dont know why marvel made this movie now bad screen play waste of money expected more if want to see the movie keep your expectations low ', ' it takes more than just great actors to make successful film so for the people behind the curtains making everything even more awesome want to give my thanks for providing us with this masterpiece of film ', ' excellent and very entertaining movie give 9 this kind of movies as to be watch and not write critic ', ' take typical modern day men script which have received thumbs down reviews from numerous fans throw in cliche mutant human bad relations and add to it the emo angst ridiculously long dialogs of anime and you have the marvel anime men presentation 2011 the animation is fairly decent especially compared to some of the mono shading stuff we ve seen on saturday morning tv from both marvel and dc there is no shortage of the typical overly buxom deep cleavage body paint costumed marvel female or the camera angles to emphasize that physical trait if you ve never thought you get tired of constant boob focus shots this series might change your mind beyond the animation this is 6 episode story drawn out to long long 12 episodes the series starts out interesting enough and holds one attention for about 4 episodes by the 6th episode the viewer is starting to feel some strain in keeping the script going 9th episode found myself wondering how much longer is is going to go on and where it leading beyond that there were some characters felt needed eliminated right now end them why are the men such incompetent morons seriously and yes know it an animated series it still had me wondering at how stupid group of people can be and about the writers directors that presented them that way it been pointed out in many reviews that the men are paradox they re supposed to be super powered and they are but any criminal with gun grenade or laws rocket could wield about as much power as any of the men with the exception of wolverine and possibly jean grey bullet could take out any of them nowhere does that become more apparent than this series in which the team is regularly disabled by one or two bad guys who seem to be nearly unstoppable the script is cliche granted this was written 9 10 years ago the monologues droll on and the extremely obvious focus on the boobs shots plentiful the men are constantly arguing amongst themselves disagreeing with one another distrusting to the point of paranoia and makes one wonder how they could ever be team there is plenty for children to take away from this the way to solve your problems is by the use of violence and excessive force women are basically sexual objects it normal behavior to distrust argue and fight with with your closest fiends and allies and if you have blades coming from your hands it perfectly acceptable to run around slashing and stabbing others with them and no accountability because that how life is right beyond that this series is close to the most emo angst ridden long drawn out absurd ending plot line ve seen those responsible for mass murder don wind up paying the price and everything is okay because people are sorry the sorriest thing about this is the story line this marvel offering could have been lot better with little more effort and lot less cliche ', ' even if the movie the story wasn that great this movie changed cinema for better or worse creating path to serialized event movies all important to have the whole picture of the insane 23 movies arc of the avengers without this movie being this fun well paced and put together we wouldn have the mcu and it pretty much delivered on what it promised without the need to introduce the main characters the movie ditched the typical structure and started with bang to never slow down really with action from the start connecting every single character already presented the six heroes their recruiter the villain the movie assumed we all knew the characters because we saw the other movies making them literally must watch to savior all the details and enhance the experience which was the best decision ever they didn follow the rules they created their own which will be become stalled later and made the best possible ensemble movie but it wasn just pure action because with tony stark and steve rogers they started and would continue in the next movies their philosophical lightly philosophical but still exploration of war against an exterior threat and they still managed to give the others moments to shine if not really arcs of their own thor and hulk with their powers black widow smart spy mind fury uniting the team etc the action is insane and the cgi ridiculously perfect loki is perfect for first villain and the dialogue is funny with the needed exposition done well having said all that the second act could be better and parts bit too childish or just stupid loki vs hulk hulk m always angry hulk vs thor but ultra minor things amazing movie ', ' watched this in the cinema with my boyfriend and we were bored from the start several times was sick of it and wanted to leave but stayed instead there was no point it was the most dull marvel film have ever watched can believe this is what they churn out for captain marvel 90 of the film was just talking on nonsensical scenes that didn make sense overall extremely disappointing and not worth watching we did walk out in the end ', ' four stars for iman vellani charm and bubbliness but story screenplay logic set and graphics are simply horrible makes this the worst mcu series it clear that marvel can never connect to south asian culture ', ' couple of episodes in was bit unsure of the show because it is so tonally different from other shows by marvel towards the end it became clear that it was aimed towards younger audience despite this it managed to touch on some important topics th most important part of this show was the representation as it is basically first in the mcu kingo felt more like stereotype for some reason great to see south asians represented well with good mix of comedy and historical context for those unaware ', ' this is the worst marvel series ever the story the acting the overall quality everything it just so dumb it like m watching nickelodeon series back in the 90s m in pain want to give another 1 star review after every single episode it that bad ', ' was leaving the cinema yesterday mostly pleased in all seriousness don expect well written movie with credible story it very flash the cgi was average but did the job intended some characters were hit and miss the red guardian was for the most part delightful and provided humour throughout natasha sister yelena was great and the back and forth between the sisters worked the villains are dumb and annoying the side villain taskmaster was the biggest disappointment loved his overconfident swagger in the comics they treat him like deadpool from origins wolverine big dumb movie it won win rewards but an enjoyable watch with disappointing climax ', ' generally skip over the marvel shows while looking through netflix because with the exception of dare devil find them to resemble the early years of disney kids tv shows with the only thing missing being relentless laugh track wasn really supersized to find punisher to be more serious and moody show considering its roots being in one of the most gore filled mainstream comics around the thing that made this show stick out to me was the expertly spaced periods of satisfying violence throughout the season have seen many articles saying that the show is too slow in the beginning while this is true for the first few episodes think it was for very good reason the long build ups to the gore are filled with interesting character arcs and allows for well deserved pay off never felt cheated out of my time by the confrontations as the series goes on you will find yourself closer and closer to the edge of your seat and the only reason you don fall off your chair completely is so that you don miss whats next the show ends in the same satisfying and well deserved format that this show is built upon in short if you choose to watch punisher you will not be disappointed ', ' the show seems to be gradually picking up from slow start and the plots seem to be getting better started watching agents of h e d without knowing what to expect joss whedon impeccable rep on one hand and the nagging question of whether marvel a s can get us interested in its storyline without any major characters the first couple of episodes dint help much either but don judge the series yet cause it only gets better ask me whedon is doing good job and the show has lot of potential if it keeps churning out good stories like in the last few episodes the lack of major characters like cap thor iron man is non issue because this show isn about them those who wanna get more of them can watch the movies or maybe grab some of those really awesome comics out there a s tells us the stories of how non powered beings like shield try to cope with all the mess that comes along with the aliens gods monsters the message is we don need superpowers to save the world see lot of promise for the show and hope they keep adding more good plots all the best o ', ' this film is what you expect from too much hype with disney budget nothing memorable about it ', ' black widow is an important character in the marvel universe and then this movie pops out and you see how bad production can be done in every way so many over exaggerated scenes guess they are in competition with fast and furious hell hollywood cliches when driving car with full action behind you you still can make jokes dull characters with poorly spoken russian accents really wonder why they have made this movie in the first place movie for 10 12 years old kids and am sure they will be even get bored don waste your time by watching this thing called movie cause it is not bad cgi is all you get as an extra ', ' season 3 episode 1 so the first inhuman the agents capture just happens to be gay really do we have to have it in our face all the time lesbians and gays another show that ll have to stop watching because abc wants to cater to the lgbt population like they couldn make enough money off all the heterosexuals that watch it has decent plot its 44 minutes of brain fodder but not we have to deal with some gay dude every frickin episode it seems like majority of the networks thing that the general population wants to see this crap don want to watch that and don want my family watching it we will have to watch another show now so guess the sponsors wont get my dollars now and m sure m not the only one tired of the lgbt junk it in the news in the papers on cable tv m tired of it ', ' it is movie worth watching but it isn as entertaining and intriguing as lot of other marvel movies we have waited so long for black widow movie and when it is finally here can help but to feel little bit disappointed tough the action wasn very good the classic marvel comedy held up to its high standards it is in fact very funny movie and the dialogue between natasha and her family is often hilarious overall this movie is pretty mediocre and it kind of felt like the whole thing was just filler ', ' ve really enjoyed ms marvel the actors their lives and the gorgeous and funky design elements it an easy show to watch with entertaining teenage cringe and lot of heart and good storytelling ', ' fantastic character buildup typical of marvel captain marvel is better version of wonder woman in parallel universe the movie had the best introduction scenes what most superhero lack ', ' it just doesn go with marvel movies as they were have seen all the marvel movies and this is the worst from acting to cgi and even dialogue delivery everything was category and the main aim of this series is to make kamala look cute and get views only from teenagers please marvel don bring second season of this damn thing ', ' the faults of this season has to do with the story and the characters while season 1 had strong performance from david tennant as the purple man kilgrave and his relationship with jessica jones was the strongest part of the show now that he gone part of what made the first season great is lost they do bring him back in one episode as someone who haunting jessica for her sins and it works really well it takes traditional super hero trope and instead opts for more personal story ', ' watch thise series with my family and really enjoy it in thise series the portrait of pakistan karchi is very good relatable accurate and nice and actors performances deserve standing anowation all the cast was top notch thise series is very close to my heart ', ' m not sure if the avengers is the best superhero movie ever but can think of one that tops it big kudos to director joss whedon screenplay zak penn script and the other scribes for writing such an intelligent movie this film is much more than bad guy wants to beat the good guys and rule the world the movie expertly weaves together plot elements of recent marvel movies thor captain america and iron man 2 enjoyed how each of the avengers had scenes that enhanced their characterizations appreciated how the tesseract cosmic cube figured into different people motivations for securing it so as to do evil or do good and not everyone agrees about which is which the dialogue in the avengers is excellent robert downey jr tony stark iron man and tom hiddleston loki are especially good at delivering their lines and what a superhero movie without punches and explosions the fight sequences are great and the special effects are fantastic congrats to the several hundred artists who made cities landscapes alien hordes and the h e d helicarrier look so realistic will be seeing the avengers again at theater soon and m already looking forward to marvel studios making avengers 2 you don have to be genius like tony stark to know that going to happen ', ' love this dysfunctional family of assassins real issues of trust and abandonment with plenty of action and humour ', ' really enjoyed watching it the fighting and training scenes are sooo good love how the three could openly and safely communicate with each other and not be toxic the characters are all great and real and down to earth ll always love movie with big female cast those are my favorite movies also the last scene hello so excited for the new era my only complain is that the cause for this movie could have been easily avoided and they should have made captain marvel 2 which explains what she did for 30 years in space alone also what happened to the skrulls and why do they still not have home after such long time the movie left lot of questions open but still love this movie it great ', ' don know why there are so many bad reviews about this movie as for me this movie gave me so much enjoyment and excitement especially at the post credit scene bcause it related to avengers end game this movie also gave you closer look about shield nick fury and of course captain marvel herself really hope that everyone will enjoy it ', ' florence pugh that all can really say she made this movie for me she was funny beautiful quick witted kicked lot of ass and made me choke up once or twice of course scarlett johansson brought her game as we all expected she has made the black widow an enjoyable interesting and sympathetic character for the past decade she has taken everything we love about the character and really flexed it in this movie great supporting characters too drags on at parts but never loses your attention ', ' set the politics aside all around really really good ', ' this is another of the marvel television shows that checked out on disney they are easy for me to pop in and out of when m feeding my daughter now grew up reading marvel comics but don recall hearing about this character of ms marvel due to this came into this one blind we are following kamala khan iman vellani like so many she a huge fan of captain marvel her and her best friend of bruno matt lintz are excited to go avengers con it is coming to jersey city where this takes place the problem is kamala strict mother muneeba zenobia shroff her father sides with her as well yusuf mohan kapur what kamala doesn realize until her family gets package from her grandmother is that she has superpowers they re brought out by bangle which she figures out at the convention and must save the lives of those around her when things go wrong this also alerts government agency of her presence there are those that want the bangle back as they need it to get home kamala is closer to them though than she realizes what find interesting here is that this movie ties in with things from shang chi captain marvel and the marvels there is power here that is greater and older than things humanity knows about did like seeing these different aspects coming together it has been an issue for me with these shows and movies post endgame what ve said is that when you defeat big bad like thanos you need something even greater for your series to stay interesting we ve gotten that on smaller level but the marvel cinematic universe is great when these things intertwine like they did will admit that had issues getting into this for me we are following teens and it was harder for me to connect with them do think that vellani was good as kamala who just wants to get her license and be allowed to grow up lintz and yasmeen fletcher are good as her friends liked the family dynamic with shroff kapur and saagar shaikh we also get to meet her grandmother played by samina ahmed that adds heart here there are couple of groups who turn out to be the villains which works for this origin story for this hero all that there is left to go into would be with the filmmaking this is shot well they do interesting things with the cinematography and showing us things with effects this doesn always work for me but it did here the music fits with the culture that is being represented as far as know do think having people aware of the culture behind this helped this is also another property that m glad they introduced to continue to make other ethnicities feel included with the super hero subgenre do think that this could have been condensed into movie and it work better but get why disney marvel didn go that route d recommend this if you re completionist and working through the mcu this gives us another new character that ve interested to see how she fits in going forward my rating 6 out of 10 ', ' honestly this film was incredible it broke me in one too many ways the choreography was outstanding overall it was very well thought out ', ' for this film to dip below 7 0 is criminal another great film from marvel and both of them did great job although it slows down bit in the middle with lots of talking the action generally keeps going pretty much throughout definitely go see it ', ' don listen to the haters keep doing your thing desi culture was spot on toxic and positive elements loved the day dream animations surprised to see so many muslim names as part of the production dive for disney for truly being equal opportunity employer ', ' doesn look like marvel series as all do not to waste time on this series this is not marvel creation but some badly made disney series for kids worst part is the acting no story bad direction 1 star is for the first few minutes of episode 1 which felt something new and from thereon it went into brainless act ', ' what the story here if it weren for pugh this movie would be total waste she was the only one worth watching where the bad guy where the story ', ' don understand why so many people don like this movie there is much action throughout the characters are spectacular and the post credit scene gave me chills although believe taskmaster could have had more potential it is still wonderful movie and was worth seeing in the theater feel like the scenes with the red room could have been improved but overall it a movie would see again ', ' criminally underdeveloped characters hugely incoherent first act and its biggest problem captain marvel herself this has all the trademark marvel touches its energetic fun and rammed with plenty of humour however none of which comes from it lead actress who seems to lack any kind of emotion or personality captain marvel feels very much like placeholder until end game and is the perfect example of rather average film ', ' m really happy with how this series has continued to improve throughout season 1 starts little slow have to say and it was bit of challenge to keep watching at times during the slow bits but the acting was very good and especially the villain in season 1 wilson fisk who is played by vincent onofrio was brilliant this actor has so much power charisma and presence that he made the villain the best it could be season 2 really improves thanks to the introduction of jon bernthal as the punisher love the marvel universe with it darker approach to the superheroes much more gritty and real than the other colourful stuff and much more an adult type of superhero action worth try ', ' really wanted to like this show considering it a female lead superhero series however they let us all down tremendously the main lead actor krysten ritter is terrible sorry she over acting every step of the way it so unnatural and painful to watch elementary at best what were they thinking surrounding her with all tremendous wonderful actors makes her stand out like sore thumb this series does not deserve to be ranked up there with broadchurch or victoria or the knick don waste your time ', ' despite being huge marvel fans we really struggled to follow the purpose of this movie the first half hour was full of action but without really explaining where the story was going to me it was all too focused from miss marvels viewpoint and despite an entertaining performance this focussed the film too much on the junior marvel market it dumbed down the movie and it felt more like super hero chick flick and the cats and the singing it was just step too far it felt like sequel that had to be made to keep the characters ticking over and relevant and employed but wouldn even bother watching it again when it comes on disney ', ' this is the marvel show we have all been waiting for it takes place in post avengers new york and criminals are taking advantage of the city what like about this show is how naturally it fits in the world already created the question has come up recently that there are several heroes in the universe that cant hold up their own movie but that people want to see one of the ways was to include them the bigger hero movies but it never feels like they are doing the characters justice then someone got the idea to do tv shows for them and while marvel agents of shield is one of the worst shows on television daredevil works great and hope the jessica jones and luke cage are just as awesome ', ' look this movie is not the best but clearly the rating is being manipulated by incelrage sure its not the dark knight but marvel movies rarely are brie larson is good as always although tad limited by the sht dialogue the real bummer about this movie though is marvel makes so many quips it ruins all and any emotional resonance the movie would otherwise have someone really needs to read over the script and go is this really necessary to every line in future marvel movies all in all 7 ', ' this show will forever hold special place in my heart it is one of the best shows have ever seen and is definitely my favorite show of all time season one starts off bit slow but if you keep watching it will be worthwhile love all the characters and it impossible to pick favorite there has never been character on the show that didn like except obviously the ones you re supposed to not like the team really acts as family and they stick together like one definitely must watch it also has lot of ties to the mcu making it even better although some people may say it not actually in the mcu you can deny it has many references and connections to the mcu ', ' after the surprising success of netflix daredevil didn knew what to expect about their next show specially because knew literally nothing about this character when saw it had yet another very pleasant surprise sometimes am not sure about which show is better dd or jj both shows have lot of great things about them once again the writing in jessica jones is amazing jessica had plenty of great lines and loved krysten ritter portrayal of the character and david tennant was amazing as kilgrave his performance rivals onofrio performance as kingpin the score by sean callery is one of the best in the entire mcu just love the neo noir style it has and the show also has an excellent tone and atmosphere daredevil was dark because of the violence and gore but jessica jones is dark because of it themes it deals with rape ptsd alcoholism this has to be the most mature thing in the mcu so far was caught off guard when watched this show never expected it to be as good as it was and can wait for season 2 ', ' mcu is at point of returning back to the magic it gave in the infinity saga phase 4 and the majority of phase 5 was like jangled approach to storytelling now we have different approach back to the magic that glued me and had me running to the theatres at every release the movies started off decently then shot into the mind scratching links and connections do not want to give away any spoilers here you have to witness the music score was good brie added some emotions and the integration of the characters was spotless even liked the musical like stint in the middle of the movie surprise well done marvel studios ', ' as with luke cage and iron fist before the demise of daredevil which must been seen as the crown jewel of the netflix marvel partnership gives me the chance to write an appraisal for the three seasons we ve received by day matt murdock charlie cox is principled lawyer who along with his friend and partner foggy nelson eldon hansen defend the good people of hell kitchen as public defendant once night falls he takes more direct approach heading to the night as daredevil and fighting crime in more literal sense both his divergent lives bring him up against wilson fisk vincent onofrio brutal but intelligent criminal mastermind daredevil is really for whatever reason cut above the other shows that have made up this netflix shared universe it might be something to do with the quality of people that were attracted to work on it behind the camera stephen knight and drew goddard initially though goddard moved on after the first season the real star of the show though are whomever the fight co ordinators are there is at least one glorious corridor battle in each series with the one in the first season where the camera pans up and down corridor as dd battles various goons crossing in and out of the shot being one of the my most memorable tv sequences of all time it might also just be that the character is better than his defenders contemporaries though still powered heightened senses related to his blindness he doesn have the same invulnerability that make jessica jones and luke cage battles more one sided affairs they also aren afraid to show the damage that the fighting causes to matt and the toll it takes on his body charlie cox does an excellent job playing murdock so much so really don feel like want to see anyone else take on the role if disney does decided to reboot the series for their own app though they did get to hit some of the characters key points his relationships with elecktra frank castle and bullseye it still feels like an opportunity missed here to continue to create some great television ', ' wow have never seen such boring uninteresting amateur film as the marvels bad acting boring story actually this film didnt have story and samuel jackson who is in every movie that comes to the cinema at least it feels that way left the cinema after 80 minutes or so because this movie was not worth my precious time hope that this isnt the end of the marvel mcu there are lot good movies in there and its not the female lead m criticising there are lot good movies with female lead actors like kill bill neil marshalls the descent or ridley scotts alien only to name few this isnt simply one of them could it be better sure with good script and betterdirector ', ' ms marvel is really cute tv show good scenes good acting great set up it definitely aimed at younger audience but it a nice breath of fresh air ', ' not good villain taskmaster ruined and more an introduction to new characters than an actuall solo black widow movie it has its fun moments and characters yet it does not stand out as great movie in the mcu leaving the feeling of dissapointment as the credits roll feels wrong that florence pugh and david harbour was the best parts of black widow movie ', ' love the idea of jessica jones self empowered anti hero with power to change things for the better in the real world not fantasy world but the show fails because it brow beats men on the whole level of the show it presents every male character as baby donor to that low level of inequality that resembles or reembarks upon the same low level of mentality that many men who were prominent in hollywood for 5 or 6 generations used and abused women is this revenge plot from women towards men if it is why pick on the every ordinary guy because there are problematic men in the business of film and music and publishing who have controlled these industries for long time but am not the enemy did not ever in my life hold you down or make it hard for you as collective of women to succeed in business or arts or anything you wanted for but it is obvious to me that collective of women do not believe in equal rights and are easy to bash upon all men no matter what they do is this equality there are bad men who are doing bad things across the universe does that mean that women across the universe should copy those bad men this show jessica jones love for its noir its so deep in the women psyche that it became abusive of regular men m not sure that what what our world needs is continuation of women battering and abuse by men to universe where women are abusive towards all men but understand why women as whole need to feel empowered this way just as the african natives needed empowerment from their slave owners what about the native indians of north america do you think there will ever be president of the united states who is apache indian many people have lost hope that that our world our universe our planet has no hope and that is correct we have lost our hope as species because we abuse everything until it dies this is our legacy it sad but true it more than sad it evil it who we have become and there is little hope to change the minds of 10 billion people who have become us think this battle for continuing life is part of what this show gleams successfully towards because it is gritty and it shows how people react to being put in bad situations that are becoming more real every day things like enhancements are very real now and the biotic man or biotic woman can be purchased so equal rights the animatrix film summed this up well so did dick do androids dream of electric sheep how far do we go to be equal orwells animal farm also gave us the question that all animals are created equal but some are more equal than others communism has everyone equal to be who they were meant to be and americanism says we are slaves don know if equality for everyone can ever be secured its something we should always be reaching for because it runs the risk of some sort of peace and love and power that should be undeniable and enduring but until we all have that hair up our arssses together we shall forever be doomed to war and fighting and self destruction greed and denial this is what makes need to live on another planet because the human race will never accept equality for all living beings they will only be self gratifying look to many series of tv shows as how looked at great rock roll albums their first album is great 2 songs that were honed to death by trial and tribulation these tv series do the same thing using recipe game of thrones walking dead files etc wanted this series jessica jones to be the sex pistols or the clash or trhe rolling stones or the doors or ministry or metallica or mazzy star or the cult or anything that makes me feel like there are writers of worth out there what found was let down by the writers over 3 seasons who took the series into fiery crash which should have been very hard to do considering the marvel backing to hire writers who would have done the series well despise the treatment of the series not the actors the writers and producers can blow me they took great story line and made most people hate it how does ruin come to good things look no further think the main actors didn even want to participate after the first season because the writing of their characters became so degraded it still watchable but ritter the main character actor who was so identifiable and relatable in the beginning becomes unidentifiable and useless and untrustworthy that the viewer wants her character to die as its written on the screenplay because she makes so many bad decisions that she becomes unforgivable ', ' what the hell writers were thinking the disappointment level cannot be explained taskmaster gender swap why it was not at all required drekhov could have just hired him for task why make taskmaster his daughter how his daughter age so quickly when she was just school kid when natasha joined shield totally disappointed by marvel this time ', ' never has superhero captured the imagination of both sexes like this one carol danvers vers captain marvel is the hero everyone needs today she came from earth and conquered the universe excellent dialogue mind blowing special effects relatable characters and the best cameo by stan lee ever ', ' there was lot of expections it didn worked out for me only best thing about movie was end credit scene ', ' once again netflix uses the tv ma rating as an excuse to ruin otherwise interesting idea with raunchy elements that push the envelope for no reason other than shock value the so called grittiness adds nothing to the story or to the character development this show has an interesting premise and could be valuable if it weren littered with so many things that made me feel sick to my stomach heard this show was an exciting thriller but after the first episode wished could wash my eyes and mind from the images had just seen m gradually learning that netflix mature rating really means immature writers and directors need more coaching here just because you can doesn mean that you should and skilled artist would be able to imply it all without filming it all ', ' not enough action the hole concept of so many widdows and station in the sky was just sleeping for this movie this should of been kick type movie ', ' this show is the cheesiest show that marvel has ever put out don know where to start without spoiling anything but think of it as bad disney kids show with superheroes iman vellani acting is adequate and is the best thing about the show ', ' cute show fun to watch after long day at work or just to kick off the weekend ve read bit of the comics one story arc and they were somewhat interesting like kamala as character what surprised me with the show is the editing the direction color pallet the graphics and camera work even the changes they made from the comics are pretty decent iman brings so much to this role her and matt whom know from the walking dead are veeeery likeable in their roles and the whole show just makes me remember what it was to be teenager doing fun goofy nerdy stuff people seem to have major double standards where watching spiderman homecoming and the adventures of 16 year old peter parker is somehow good for all ages yet watching 16 year old kamala khan is show for children hmm anyway prefer the episodic structure as opposed to the long movie cut into 6 pieces kind of structure the show is pretty good in fact when it comes to actual quality it is one of the most well made disney marvel shows seriously have seen absolutely terrible tv shows over the years and they don even have 6 10 people are absolutely free to not like something but throwing 1 10s left and right because reasons ain it my guys ', ' daredevil was such an incredible show charlie cox daredevil and vincent onofrio wilson fisk led such an amazing cast who were all at the top of their game throughout this amazing series it too bad that marvel and netflix had to split up because they made some pretty special shows all of them were great but daredevil and the punisher were easily the best among them it one of the best superhero crime shows ever made and where all 3 seasons were great there really not much more to say that hasn already been said about this amazing show so just do yourself favor and go watch it ', ' saw this earlier today and was surprised because read non spoiler reviews and they were extremely mixed it didn feel too long at all and there plenty of action didn like what they did to certain villain but it could ve been worse took way too long to release but it a cool film ', ' started off interesting enjoyed the character and appreciated the chance to diversify and tell other types of stories but it very poorly written and unfortunately contains what believe is the worst offender in the mcu for being basically the mcu version of dcs save martha moment it obviously written for kids and though mostly enjoyed it at first it went downhill in the last few episodes not really worth watching except to keep up with the mcu canon same as doctor strange mom ', ' yeah that right black widow is no doubt the worst movie ever don know why this movie was made in the first place it absolutely makes no sense making movie about dead avenger after its death and after the completion of the infinity saga one of the worst cgi ve ever seen in marvel movie and in fact in any movie after mummy 2 story is so dispersed and boring action sequences are good but absolutely no justice to the protagonist or the main villain don know what marvel was thinking when they decided to make this movie one star is for action and another for red guardian and the post credit scene otherwise this movie is an absolute waste of time ll recommend you to watch snyder cut shazam aquaman or man of steel instead ', ' cant believe that this film got more than 6 10 rating to even see 8 8 10 is utterly ridiculous the story line is just cut and paste scenes the villain is weak ok now pause minute add all of the above to bunch of funny clips that we all watch in the extras in the dvd version but instead these clips are placed in the middle of intense action in the mood to fight battle scenes that will completely drop your focus mean just when you are starting to like the film and get into the mood and into the story you get interrupted by some stupid guess funny clip that we could have avoided other than that if you watched transformers you are not missing anything just some blow ups that you loose count of at the end of the film ', ' this is very good movie it has great story line it also has great acting it also has great special effects the avengers age of ultron is better but still this is great movie give it 9 out 10 ', ' fully spoiler free went into this pretty open minded haven seen marvel movie in 5 years so decided to try and give them another shot since this one was supposed to be so different this movie was just boring don really understand why super hero movies are losing the plot because it really not that hard give us good action sequences and fun story again it crazy how far the genre has fallen remember every time new marvel or dc movie was coming out the entire office would be talking about it it seems like am the only one of my cohort that even went to see this and don blame them save your money for christmas presents or something else black friday is about to arrive m sure you can find better use for your money in some sales ', ' there are several reasons why this film fails as something person should ever watch more than once firstly there is major lack of plot twists or changes to the story that might keep you on the edge of your seat everything about the plot is insultingly linear and predictable and follows the most basic structure of goods versus evil with predictable injection of basic virtue and morals in this case unity and teamwork are clearly highlighted secondly the film manages to insult your most basic intelligence by showcasing unnecessary antics that are nothing more than fantastical nonsense think of an action scene and describe it in words this is way to bypass the lush graphics and realize that while iron man is in space and is flying away from the portal he somehow changes direction in the vacuum of space and returns through the portal the hulk who cannot fly jumps few hundred feet in the air and catches iron man before bouncing off to safety nick fury is violently gunned down dusts himself down in time to evacuate the base captain america is shot down dusts himself down and carries on black widow who also is incapable of flight gives captain america psychic eyeballing to communicate she wants to jump ten times her height into the air by bouncing off your shield so can hijack space orcs flying motorcycle which is speeding towards us from distance one could argue that it is not meant to be realistic and is mere entertainment what becomes salient about avengers assemble is that there are no rules the heroes never get stuck never get challenged they re never in any recognizable danger there are no puzzles any challenge is overcome easily and characters do as they please no rules means no mystery no interest and nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat finally the antagonist was hardly foreboding to ever present sense of danger or worry against so many heroes all equal protagonists all dreadfully dull especially bruce banner ', ' season 1 really enjoyed season 2 was still pretty good but not as good as season 1 season 3 just really made me angry mostly trish one of the most unlovable characters have ever seen everything she did just made me wanna close the episode and not watch again ', ' too many of the marvel superheroes lack originality when it comes to culture language and background appreciated the diversity and the taste of new and refreshing background story that isn just of typical american upbringing feel lot of people specially the younger generation can relate to kamala story than most other superheroes feel by the end of it learned quite bit of new information when it comes to the muslim culture here in america along with pakistani culture there are tons of brown people in america and it nice to learn some things from their prospective sure the show felt like it was targeted towards the younger adult group but it makes sense since kamala is teenager herself great show and hope there is season 2 ', ' while really enjoyed the storyline in captain america and the oddball plot in guardians of the galaxy series my best comment for the marvels is meh it doesn have the plot or storyline to support the tedious computer graphics the movie appears to just offer up the standard set of superhero dialogue and action without any real character development or actors who can sell their superhero personas m horse lover and dislike when movie studios and directors keep pushing the same old stories but what really lacking is brie in selling her superhero character they needed stronger female actor to have made this movie success ', ' since that final clip with nick fury and tony stark in iron man there was hope that maybe marvel could really be doing an avengers movie 4 years later and 4 movies later iron man 2 hulk thor captain america and we have joss wheddon avengers what makes the avengers so engaging and intriguing is the dialogue between the superheroes joss wheddon should be awarded with an oscar for the writing and directing of the avengers everyone blended in so naturally and their back and fourth banter made for some good comedy everyone felt equal from hawkeye to hulk it is so difficult to balance these personalities on screen and don think any other director besides joss would ve been able to pull it off the way he did the action scenes in the avengers is as epic as it gets the last hour is like marathon of awesomeness every action sequence in this movie was perfectly executed and each character had their significant moments the cast was phenomenal as usual but the show stealer is definitely mark ruffalo his portrayal of the incredible hulk was spot on he was wildly entertaining and couldn help but cheer him on when he smashed sh i think what made the hulk work was because he was used sparingly lo ki as the villain was great felt he was developed lot better here than in thor he was witty and had an evil aura about him especially when he was interacting with the mortals never have enjoyed movie so much as the avengers the 2 hour plus runtime flew by easily and was left wanting more once it ended once in while masterpiece of film comes along and after the hilarious closing scene after the credits it was clear that this was marvel masterpiece back to the future and terminator 2 have always been my go to favourite movies after this gem believe can the avengers to that list 10 10 ', ' pure mindless violence and mayhem could not figure out what the plot was in my opinion this movie was made just for the special effects the only reason for me to watch this movie was to see the cleveland ohio landmarks in the beginning of the film the city where grew up in and moved away from otherwise there was no other need to see this besides bad script the acting was just as bad like good action movie as much as anyone but this film was anything but good know that there were sequels made and good luck with them don intend to waste my time watching any of them personally do not think this was up to stan lee standards ', ' really enjoyed the story acting and directing style glad to have quality marvel show can watch with my partner who is turned off by the violence and intensity of other shows comic books are for all ages and kinds of people glad to see this reflected in the direction of this show which is more kid and tween friendly and has awesome and much needed muslim representation ', ' loved this from the opening sequence it was full of action but with poignant moments that bring greater understanding of natashas back story we have waited so long for black widow origins films and this really was brilliant hints of jason bourne in the action sequences which is no bad thing m only sad that they didn cover budapest in more detail d have liked to see how nat and hawkeye met hoping that we get to see another instalment of black widows past before they move on to the next phase ', ' my campaign to finish the mcu and get up to date has been long and painful journey marvel black widow not making it any easier along the way we ve encountered some pretty bad marvel movies but think black widow definitely ranks among the top three for most disfigured donut it not like can point finger and say that the problem right there officer there are multitude of issues that plague this film and make it difficult one to watch and later to recommend while the core narrative is decent and invents unique challenges for the cast the editing and dialogue feels very shallow and low quality lot of the cgi for this film looks shockingly poor and with action at the center of the tootsie pop black widow can move forward with plastic visuals what only makes this worse is shoddy writing for the characters great cast most notably florence pugh with her catchy demeanor and strong emotional presentation is reduced to ash with lack of depth and connectivity frequently found myself saying so what to almost every narrative element and decision made by the cast simply because there was nothing for me to latch onto and empathize with what was seeing and of course there a feel good ending curse the soul who thought making audiences happy at the end of movie was good idea the primary handicap for black widow is its lack of depth there are marvel films that pull you in with their cast and relatability but this film has none of it combine it with poor editing and visuals and you re left with film with fizzling existence the only thing can say is florence pugh back must hurt from carrying this film and the post credits scene does some absolutely fantastic foreshadowing ', ' seems to have become slow moving soap opera featuring patricia when did jessica superpowers become incidental where is the bad guy with super powers it needs brilliant antihero like kilgrave loved season 1 season 2 was letdown but watched it all so far season 3 has not drawn me in don know if can get through the whole thing ', ' this show is brilliant every thing from the acting to the plot and action scenes is executed brilliantly so sad it was cancelled this show deserved more ', ' this movie further establish that these kinds of movies are more or less the same there a bad guy with plan to destroy the world and there the overly dramatic good guys who wants to stop it from happening and then there a long tedious battle with cars getting blown off and buildings getting torn apart ', ' episode 1 started excellent though not having watched daredevil was little confused as to the back story never mind love the dark complicated punisher character the acting and cinematography were fantastic and the action was brilliant fast forward to episode 4 and it like nothing interesting has happened since the plot trudges on and on ever so slowly and the whole show has become second rate law drama endless boring dialogues the plot has barely progressed and the secondary characters are oh so boring even the superb action sequences from previous episodes are practically gone with sub par car chase sequence which is one of the worst car chase edits ve seen in recent memory constituting the action for this particular episode really hope this picks up soon because the promise was so good but don know if will make it since here am writing review in the middle of an episode in an attempt to share and alleviate the boredom caused by it if you like crime thrillers or slow paced drama then the punisher might be for you if you where looking for dynamic fast paced high octane superhero show then do by all means watch the first episode and nothing more ', ' if you write bad review about this show you have absolutely no business writing reviews could argue that the casting especially with frank castle is the best marvel has ever done the writing the directing and the choreography is probably the best on netflix ever m almost afraid for third season to come out because can see them matching the first two if they do it would be miracle enjoy folks it doesn get better than this ', ' have only ever walked out of movie once in my lengthy adulthood of cinema going but this drivel had me considering it and sadly very early on in the screening the only thing that kept me in my seat was the fascination of how awful the movie was and the curiosity could it continue to be consistently bad it was now ll give some acknowledgment hadn seen the tv series spin off but actually seeing the character of ms marvel am glad was spared that ordeal the movie is just mess mundane plot sterile characters and some really dodgy acting by all it really was just pick up the cheque but guess if the script is drivel what can they do one good joke cat reference background song my advice give it miss however if you are going make sure you ve seen ms marvel if not then don waste your time and money ', ' am one of the people who criticised every marvel film for years hell criticised endgame when it came out because it detracted from infinity war in an ideal world disney marvel would ve ended at the blip but it didn and have admittedly disliked quite lot of the stuff that come since due to interpreting it as preachy not only does it not make sense but it also feels like it dislikes me as viewer and felt left out this film though didn feel left out at all which is mad considering this film has intentionally stripped people like me out of it all together still somehow managed to connect to the character possibly because it actually written well and quite funny two points actually made me laugh out loud the part where fury reacts to carol falling to the ground and the part where carol turns out to be princess have no idea what different about this film but for the first time wasn left feeling confused and slightly accused but actually felt like was understanding roughly what was happening and that the filmmakers wanted me to enjoy the experience surprisingly good easy going film 8 10 ', ' even being mcu fan black widow is one of the least interesting characters and hardly had any expectations from the movie so it really didn dissapoint it does no changes to the mcu and the events takes place after civil war so not much of backstory the action sequences are top notch and that probably the only shine in the movie along with some decent performances specially by david harbour would come somewhere in the last row of the mcu favourite lists ', ' why was everyone speaking so slowly do they all have speech impediment this is ghastly movie the worst have ever partially watched read the reviews for prometheus which was not flawless but it was powerful and contained some outstanding imagery and it actually scored lower than this the avengers odious piece of crap the acting was extraordinarily bad the dialogue so witless and dim that it defies belief watched the first hour but was in danger of vomiting with disgust at any moment and so turned it off scarlet johansen is classy actress what was she thinking also gwyneth paltrow robert downey junior is great actor who seems to always play in dumb movies he worth more than than heard good things abut this movie what have we come to that people rate this garbage as entertainment ', ' see bunch of really weird reviews out there one guy even gave it one star and writes m not used to marvel movies then why trash them first of m dude and really really liked this one gave it solid 8 but in full disclosure m not comparing this to movies like the shawshank redemption or the godfather or jurassic park those are all completely different categories am rating this based on all marvel movies ve seen and absolutely loved this one florence pugh did an absolutely amazing job and is funny as hell david harbour the super hero with dad bod is absolutely hilarious noticed during the pandemic lot of armchair critics starting firing up their computers in their mom basements and decided it would be good idea to trash fantastic movies let me tell you this this one is actually good and solid entertainment ', ' started with real potential but started drifting off into my dreams about 30 minutes in wasn exactly dynamic just not bad and as for ray winston attempt at russian accent it was pathetic made me cringe to say the least just get someone in who can actually fulfil the role for goodness sakes mean come on there were few highlights here and there but not enough to make movie that stands out and that is robust enough unfortunately just slightly above average movie at 6 10 for me like to feel something as most do when immersing oneself into film and there was very little for me to get lost in ', ' iman vellani is delight love her in this film and the tv show and honestly think she carries the fun where the rest of the cast isn able to because of their character traits downside well there are lot and there are lot of unanswered questions plus nothing really happens that the case with most marvel movies these days which is really tiresome but it what expect now the main villain wasn very well rounded and could have been more sympathetic if they spent more time establishing her but this isn a terrible movie despite what lot of people are saying ignore the 1 star reviews see the movie expecting fun time and hopefully you will have one ', ' the director has gone way over the top into the religion and culture than any action like m watching terrible bellwood movie worst show they ve done to date how is it been 6 episodes and only 1 episode worth of actual storyline didnt see black panther do this the director is meant to be comedian havent laughed once just too childish ', ' from some of the other reviews was expecting dr who season 11 preach fest with pacing issues but that couldn have been further from the truth captain marvel is lots of fun everyone seems to be enjoying themselves and brie larsen is great despite what even the positive reviews said really liked her in king kong and free fire was excited to see she was joining the mcu so was disappointed to read so many people say she wasn very good but she was fine the character is fairly bland which is not unusual for heroes but she manages to bring charisma and real sense that she enjoying herself to the role m actually looking forward to seeing what they do with her in the next avengers movie well paced plenty of good jokes an old woman gets punched in the face and it doesn seem creepy the fonz gets mention and there one punch the air moment that could have come from raiders of the lost arc there some nice twists in the story too which manages to elevate it above some origin stories which are frequently too much origin and not enough story from the trailers was expecting top gun in tights but tonally it reminded me most of 80s tv shows like knight rider and airwolf rip but in tights can really put my finger on why though just felt the same ignore the trolls go see you ll have blast it not up there with the last avengers one but it a good marvel movie and definitely not one of their rare missteps ', ' really hope india makes it up know it big market but you lost everyone else too slow not on the map compared to shield too india compared to everything not bolywood just dumb and boring illiterate could not made it to the end of the pilot episode and sucker for marvel univers movies sorry if it is too much to someone ', ' this show is simply amazing it has great writing superb acting unpredictable storylines deep and interesting themes great attention to details and amazing pacing took me long time to watch this and then watched only half of the first episode and quit then finally went back to it and im glad did do little analyse about this web site and you gonna discover that most people voting don even watch the show most of the negative reviews are from the first episode first year this show definitely deserves higher rating even though it starts slow it becomes better and better with each episode it is action packed the chemistry between the actors is great and it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next and the science behind it makes it all lot more interesting was sad to hear that season 7 was the final one cause wasn tired of the show at all which usually happens when show is dragged on for too long ', ' saw the movie and as many others said in their comments it was not what was expecting yet what loved must about this movie was scarlett johansson smile love it when she smiles ', ' pros 1 the score gives the film lively and adventurous feel particularly the vibrant avengers theme tune 2 the cgi mostly looks great and is mixed expertly with the practical effects to keep it grounded 3 the action scenes are choreographed well and are very entertaining to watch 4 there is excellent chemistry between all of the actors especially those playing the avengers 5 for the most part the set and costume design is brilliant and they build the world perfectly 6 the humour produces many laughs is inserted appropriately and never outstays its welcome 7 robert downey jr tony stark iron man scarlett johansson natasha romanoff black widow tom hiddleston loki and mark ruffalo bruce banner the hulk deliver fantastic performances 8 the character altercations and progressions are handled deftly as well as concluded nicely 9 the battle for new york is exceedingly epic and impressive in regards to its scale the high stakes and the visuals cons 1 there is distractingly high overuse of dutch angles 2 the captain america chris evans suit looks little cheap and tacky 3 few of the cgi moments haven aged well at all ', ' script is terrible acting is simple and flat story is small but stretched like bubblegum it feels cheap unnecessary drama to keep story going forced myself to watch season 2 because of high ratings but think netflix cracked the ratings code ', ' if this is how disney sees youth of today it really spoiles the other fairly good productions coming from them it is an empty vessel painted in bright colors on the outside with hollow unpleasant sound the bits and bobs of culture they appropriated to make this are feel like some sort of mockery it is noisy gives feeling of innebriation even nausea whoa let all put our noses in viral silly things streaming out of our phones laugh while behaving mischevous and act like all the expensive things product placed by the characters are for free childish is not the word for this more like offensively unreal know few people who act like this and on the inside they are just troubled scared disorientated kids not at all goal to be like this and not by far the real issues that drive these people towarfs flashy exterior and mimetic behaviour copying stars and tin vip while highly profitable for the megacorporations are in fact indicators of deep unhappiness and lack of real fitire of horizon for those who do it aignore the problems cultivate these fake outlets for pain not fitting in desperation and lack of roots and who knows what lies next close to disaster quite evil from disney to propagate this illusions about the youth and where it stands now compared with previous iterations as populational segment shame ', ' it had some good parts mostly bad massive plot holes ', ' maybe my expectation on this series was too high this is more like bedtime story for kids characters in the series are not interesting at all or maybe the shows is too short the worst part would be really boring story line which could not find any room for excitement ', ' this show started off slow and dreadful it got slower and more dreadful the only time that the show got relatively watchable was when it tied into winter soldier this show does everything that it can to distance itself from the shared universe with which it is perported to be part so much so when they do try to tie it into the grand scheme of things sif inhumans ghost rider it just seems massively out of place such waste of money cast and potential we re beyond the time of the first men film of black leather and poo pooing comic book origins we re in time when thanos seeks the infinity gauntlet professor hulk and captain marvel are gracing our screens so what does this show do black leather and ignore the comics which are so popular right now even when the show gets mildly interesting and somewhat cool like going to the future space lmds they drag it out to such slumber indicing pace that you wonder what the point really is see lots of 10 star reviews it must be so nice to be so easily amused by such poor writing and storytelling but guess that the only few people still watching this thing with any regularity are those that like it and have extremely low demands on their entertainment or have never heard of cable tv ', ' have read negative reviews about jessica jones season 2 and would have to disagree with them it wasn that bad in the first season jessica was overshadowed by the kilgrave character in season 2 it is an origins story and gives you the full details of her background the supporting cast especially her mother and lawyer played by carrie ann moss had good story lines and added to the overall plot which kept it interesting and made you want to finish the season to the end the only downside is the trish character find her annoying and irrelevant the cray cray bit was awful the series has potential and hope they make another season as am interested in where the story goes overall it was better than expected and enjoyed it so jessica should finally crack smile to good show ', ' was really disappointed by the movie because was having high hopes as like marvel movies in general but this movie felt more like dc movie oddly paced the story felt like they don know where to go with it and the special effects were rather pointless rate the movie 5 10 because it barely average compared to other action marvel movies overall very disappointing would even consider ww84 better movie than this one ', ' don watch marvel like used to when the children were small but gave this chance what mistake the acting is just terrible feel like everything is in slow motion in this series the show is so dark dull and just crap the idea of this is just awful as well do not know what the high reviews are all about as the episodes that saw were terrible the acting really killed it for me can get past the scenes that show woman being an alcoholic and being terrible person but then having conscience and trying to help find missing girls with her powers this is just dumb and boring truly crap ', ' marvel lost disney made disney channel superhero series and attached it to the mcu that has no precedence in the mcu my 7 and 10 yr old daughters who are huge mcu fans were upset made them watch this catastrophe of events what next for disney to do in the mcu spin off captain america and call it lieutenant usa ', ' the series thankfully stays pretty faithful to daredevil comic roots basically ensuring it status as one of marvels greatest live action origin stories ', ' atrocious not movie series of scenes pasted together like poster with pasted news stories from 38 different papers dialogue atrocious acting pretty much atrocious capt marvel was totally different character than the last movie no story no change no growth the three girls met and 12 hours later they re hugging and crying like they re sisters who ve never been without each other the director had no clue how to make movie the studio has no clue what good movie looks like atrocious my son at one point about and hour in looked at me and commented that he still waiting for the story to progress that he felt like he was watching trailer that never ended ', ' ok maybe is little early for big tv celebrations since there is only one episode has aired already but im pretty sure joss whedon will create another historical tv show that everyone will remember for many years like he has done in the past with almost all his projects joss is the man to create super hero to make them love or hate or even scare of them to develop characters to kill them and of course to bring them back to life like nobody else as was watching the episode the funny dialogues the action the mystery it reminded me again the old good buffy days the potential for a real deal on tv is definitely huge with this tv series even though the team first assignment involving an ordinary guy with strange new powers august richards is kind of average as adventures go the actors seem to have found snappy groove already the avengers was destined for tv show and it sure as hell got good one this is definitely one of the best news shows of the year and it definitely deserves to be watched and praised trust me this show will lure you in and won let go millions of people waited long time for marvel finally to hit the television and they couldn make better choice than joss this is joss whedon billion dollar franchise guardian and with great power comes great eh only wish in the future to see some buffy firefly angel actors to quest star in some episodes it will be great surprise for us the old ones who always believed in this mastermind ', ' am not going to write my full length review here because fell asleep during some of the moments was tired long story short though the movie lackluster story and boring attitude of the main protagonist some forced scenes made it feel rushed couple of things like what is an alien cat doing inside research base why hasn anyone done anything about it why is the most pwerful marvel superhero so bland and bossy why is origin story so boring and just straight up bad why was only nick fury sent to investigate denvers how did denvers crashing went unnoticed by howard stark and like that it leaves lot of questions and does not do well to make us connect with captain marvel the how she got her powers scene was very ridiculous my brain kept telling me that she just got lucky she was at the right place at the right time that it she did next to nothing to get the most generic and cliched powers and became the most powerful of the mcus hero its just too tough to digest compared to other big heroes in the mcu who went through so much and had such great story lines hopefully avengers endgame does justice to her and all other heroes aswell ', ' ingest everything marvel will ingest this ve learned more about pakistani life and culture watching ten minutes of this than ve ever learned my entire life oh my god the humanity that marvel develops premise around someone who isn a white male with huge arms and pecs to hold and comfort angry lonely men it a mixture of teenage drama we ve seen centered around white girls the last thirty years so it obviously utilizes tropes so what it colorful and charismatic bigger budget it familiar with some new ideas and insights to offer it ll be fine fellas strong men still exist and will be seen sprinkled throughout the marvel universe it ok to shift focus off of them after only seeing movies and shows about them over the last 40 years stay strong pussycats ', ' would have categorized myself as marvel fanboy just couple years ago or even year ago at the start of wandavision unfortunately am getting the impression they are targeting new audience because haven felt like anything has been great since endgame with the exception of spiderman and the new thor movie this show continues don the path of checking off diversity boxes that alone is not the issue have no problem with diverse characters but when it comes as sacrifice to good story telling or starts to feel like pandering to that audience become uninterested ms marvel is meant for the teenage crowd think if were in highschool might have found it more engaging enjoyed kamala character but after she gets her powers the lack of compelling villain and an aimless feel to the story makes this disney entry forgettable ', ' if you have the patience and good taste this show will easily change your life ', ' the movie overall was not what was expecting it was funny and has lot of action but in lots of areas it seemed that they could ve expanded the storyline and it felt like missed opportunity it had was good but not excellent ', ' love this series having watched seasons 1 and 2 on netflix in fairly quick space of time about 1 month how ve grown to love the introduction with the creepy graphics and the music you can get out of your head the acting is amazing and the characters really seem real and their stories engrossing foggy is brilliant so is matt of course and karen is brilliant too the fighting is also amazing but love the way daredevil matt is like an ordinary guy he doesn seem really big or muscly and you can certainly feel the pain when he gets hit what great story and great series can believe they re not making series 3 for some time now keep it going netflix ', ' also thought after watching the first episode that the series is waste exactly from 15 minutes into the 2nd episode the series has actually taken off finished episode 3 and like it more it mysterious and vibrant look forward for good finale ', ' marvel went out of their way to make this as excellent as it is not agenda at all which is another good thing family friendly 80 vibe and perfectly done ', ' loved the avengers it is easily my favorite movie of the year so far it the kind of movie that left us happy afterwards that made us want to discuss it at length and made us leave reality in every sense an aesthetic experience loved the action scenes special effects and all but suppose what loved best about it were the hilarious one liners that literally had the entire cinema laughing out loud there were so many of these too many to count with my fingers in fact there was also one moment when actually cried but then that was just me tend to cry over everything sheepish smile was initially afraid that so many characters in one movie would result in one convoluted mess but the writers managed to make script that somehow gave each character their own screen time without making it appear too contrived or as though they just forcibly slotted story in just so certain character could appear the entire story actually made sense and flowed naturally into one cohesive whole was also initially afraid that so many hunky heroes in one movie would make my heart or brain explode from confusion as to which one to ship as had fallen in love with each one of these heroes when watched their individual films in the years past okay not all of them just iron man thor and captain america but here what realized the avengers makes for an interesting study in finding out what girl truly finds attractive in man depending on who she loves most among the heroes is it captain america the handsome and wholesome boy next door with the hero noble heart is it thor the fierce masculine man with rippling muscles facial hair and deep throaty growl is it the hulk the reserved brainiac with surprisingly endearing shy smile or it it iron man the witty genius billionaire playboy philanthropist in his own words am not going to recap the story just go watch it yourself it will be worth every single penny tells ya ', ' when wanted them to make stand alone black widow movie all the way back to her premiering in the lackluster iron man 2 kinda wanted it when she was alive but guess going back in time is what the mcu does best now just clarification that not spoiler for this movie it just part of the mcu that she passes in avengers endgame and that acknowledged here to put my feeling for the mcu in perspective none of the 24 avenger movies fall into my top 20 action movies of all time not that they were bad plenty of them were good to great it just most of them are comedies first and action comic book movies second or third such in the case of both iron man 3 and thor ragnarok both were 80 comedies with smidge of action mercifully black widow is less of comedy although the one running gag posing was funny and creative and few other jokes landed not terribly funny but luckily this isn meant to be funny nope in this case it 80 drama and 20 action don get me wrong 2 of the 3 4 action scenes were good the now overused yet still fun climax being the best but the action was so few and far in between and sadly just didn connect with the drama and sad scenes very well never felt bad for these people even when kids were involved maybe it because the movie was so cold little heart could be felt after solid cold opening showing our infamous natasha romanoff aka the title character as kid about to become said title character we fast forward to her well established as the black widow well one of them anyways there we see her go on very basic and simple mission with her estranged sister and family oh and they probably mentioned the word avengers more times in this movie and her connection to them than all 4 actual avenger movies combined my biggest problem with this movie is that wanted to see either an origin story of her trials and tribulations of becoming my 2nd favorite avenger behind captain steve rogers or she already black widow and she smartly kicks as much ass as she done with every other appearance of hers in the mcu well did get about 7 minutes of that origin story and about 10 minutes of her actually being the kick ass super spy we all love those 10 minutes are the last 10 minutes of the movie the rest of the movie and here the problem she is black widow throughout the movie sans those original 7 minutes in the cold open so why do they make her so oh hum throughout she not learning to become black widow she been that way since the opening credits we just finally get her bad assery in the closing and by then was incredibly bored with so many overly dramatic and predictable drawn out scenes but that was my biggest issue in truth it wasn that bad of the movie even though ton of it was generic action scenes or family drama never reaching tension did enjoy scarlett as always but here she just felt like sean connery coming back for never say never again like this was just paycheck for her while it a mild recommendation it not at all necessary to see this movie in connection with the others except for the weak post credit scene all the way at the end of the 20 minutes of credits it felt so much like mid season storyline couple of episodes of tv season never as great as the first 2 episodes and definitely less fun excitement as the season finale last few episodes think of it as episode 4 6 of 9 part tv season final thoughts here my updated ranking of all the mcu movies with stars best to worst 1 marvel the avengers 4 5 stars 2 captain america the first avenger 4 5 stars 3 guardians of the galaxy 4 5 stars 4 avengers infinity war 4 5 stars 5

stars ', ' ok don know why but just don like the main actress at all can say if it ist because of the character she playing or because of her appearance didn like season 1 but it had some good spots it starts very weird and boring and gets better toward the end of the season the final episode is good so was very positive for season 2 ithaught with another enemy it could be better watching season 2 is really painful just watch it because of the defenders story fall asleep every time am very disappointed the charakter of jessica jones also is worse than in season 1 and the deeper background story doesn make it any better ', ' sure get it it not the best marvel movie but m still glad watched it at the cinema it entertained me and had an awesome cat ', ' ok am pakistani well into my 40s not marvel fan bt have watched all marvel movies like this series am enjoying the characters the funny situations created and the girl playing ms marvel is also adorable like how truthfully our culture is depicted from the gossiping aunties to the hijabi girl chosing to wear hijab well done ', ' really really disappointing film really really disappointing film really really disappointing film ', ' absolutely brilliant not single dull moment in this movie great to see robert downey jr after sherlock holmes right on the button he is having amazing sense of representing tony stark in the iron man franchise and now in the avengers captain america thor were fabulous in this movie the action was top notch scarlett was ok and missed edward norton as hulk although mark has done an excellent job as hulk especially with some of his interactions with other super heroes wish hawk eyes character would have been given better treatment he was lost in the crowd of super heroes all greats ensemble to form this wonderful movie go watch and enjoy all the super heroes of america ', ' disappointing at best neither an origin story nor continuation no background as to how she became widow assassin nor what motivated her to join the avengers and do the right thing florence pugh is delight title character scarlett johansson zero to work with in terms of motivation found it pretty confusing and big disappointment david harberg red guardian is silly attempt at comic relief basically mess ', ' ve been marvel fan for many years now so was really excited when the next marvel movie came out in saying that feel the last few marvel movies haven been up to par so was little hesitant to watch the marvels to avoid disappointment but was pleasantly surprised though how good this movie was highly recommend watching the marvels it funny cleaver and the action scenes are incredible it definitely better than the first movie brie larson is amazing as usual teyonah parris is bad ass and iman vellani is so damn funny please put your biased opinions aside and watch this movie trust me it worth it ', ' acting is way over the top actual world history shouldn be incorporated in fictional stories cringe dialogues and way too stereotypical portrayal of south asians bad show don waste your watching it ', ' this is not bad series that is if you are teen girl who likes icarly or one of the nickelodeon shows but then it has these gory scenes with people being murdered with knives so guess it not really teen series but then it has some superhero action which happens halfway around episode 4 and 6 it seems to be tied to the mcu by carol danvers but only in mentioning for couple of seconds so it really doesn matter whether you watch it or not and it really seems to be more focused on comedy or historical aspects or how many boys miss marvel dates or saving the world from annihilation apparently this aspect was so ignored it may as well not exist this is rudderless series that shows how badly marvel has failed us its fans it tries to include everything for everyone and it ends up being pretty much nothing ', ' seems like characters forget every lesson learnt and stupidity in them acts out very poorly written seems like season 2 is lot worse typical soap opera serials ', ' when first heard the title of this movie thought it was about 1960s girls singing group and frankly that would have probably made for better movie writer director nia dacosta third feature outing and the latest in the marvel universe paradigm is wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn have script to support it too many of its plot elements aren adequately explained until well into the story while others aren explained at all leaving viewers who aren comic book laureates wondering what going on particularly at film end meanwhile other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all too brief while on top of that the cgi effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other creating mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best add to that villain that isn particularly menacing along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly cat lovers take note or fall flat and look incredibly lame as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest all of which further add to the picture pervasive inconsistency the inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching marvel universe storyline continues here too furthering trend that growing tiresome in the studio releases development akin to the paul is dead legacy come to life with every passing picture then there the trio of heroes themselves who often appear more like they ve been plucked from giddy slumber party flick or cyndi lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action adventure offering all of these failings combine to make this production more of forgettable placeholder in the marvel mythology than standalone feature not to mention pale substitute for sequel to the far superior film that launched the captain marvel franchise in 2019 in short the marvels is as much of mess as it is movie and that troubling for several reasons it lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren to be taken seriously it reinforces the notion that they re cookie cutter in nature easily interchangeable with one another and it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress brie larson who though quite capable of playing roles like these is running the risk of becoming type cast troubling prospect for an academy award winning actress who possesses depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this in the wake of this release marvel studios should take step back and seriously assess where its future is headed especially if movies like this are any indication as pictures like wakanda forever 2022 show the studio is capable of better work and it time to show viewers that ', ' trish walker is nothing burger she a waste of time who cares about her no one talking to herself to psych herself up that third grader stuff suffered through episode one but after suffering through half of episode two quit what complete waste of time the show is now worthless ', ' this is more of summary than anything really you won see anything that you haven already seen in previous marvel movies however this is nice recap to watch before the new wondervision show comes out later this week in the future when new marvel series are released such as the falcon and the winter soldier this will serve as nice reminder of what the characters have done recently in past movies ', ' don want to waste more time talking about movie that just wasted 2 1 2 hours of my life watching but feel it necessary in order to maybe save someone from making the same mistake just did by watching this stinker actually slept through some of it so there was some valuable time spent in the theater would have walked out except my girlfriend look like she was enjoying it this movie just sucked plain and simple it the typical good guys have to save the earth from aliens it did have all the emotions though the dialog was laughable and the acting made me want to cry unless you just like seeing buildings getting demolished and people who are impervious to bullets explosions and every kind of weapon known to man stay home and save your money ve watched better cartoons as kid it actually angers me that there are so many people in this world the simply loved this movie this movie was so bad may never go to the theater again ', ' this shows style and writhing fits the comic character really well while it geared toward younger people there is lot to appreciate and enjoy for older people as well the design elements alone are fantastic and some of the best ve ever seen they had to get through bunch of exposition in the first episode so some parts feel little rushed but understand the need in this case it sad to see all the review bombing trying to push people away from an enjoyable show ', ' watch season 1 for the well written characters the gruff anti hero magnetism of kristen ritter performance the representation of healthy friendship between adult women which is weirdly hard to find the top tier cinematography david tenant ability to make your skin crawl and one of if not the most faithful depiction of ptsd on tv watch season 2 to wallow in cesspool of relentless darkness lacking any levity or balance or coherent plot in which each episode is playing suicidal game of oneupmanship with the one that came before it the quality of the entire production took such nose dive wouldn even call it the same show anymore ', ' well that 13 hours won get back season 2 was huge disappointment the first six episodes were not bad but the plot contrivances and acting got progressively worse up to the end it seems as if there was writing staff change midway the three sub plots had so many logic holes that it is impossible to recount maybe the lack of star talent like rosario dawson or character to play off of like luke cage would have helped if third season is made hope they can rekindle the spark of season 1 ', ' can say was too excited about another marvel movie after the last few duds but didn hate the first captain marvel and saw that they were at least trying to do something fun with this one unfortunately though it really is just another ok superhero movie there another stock alien with hammer who motive can even remember and its up to our trio of forgettable heroes to save the day with some lackluster cgi one of them is of course an annoying child sidekick upgraded to main character and you ll be confused at times if you haven seen every other marvel movie and tv show so far but its not total disaster there is some decent action and the characters switching their powers around at least adds little something different even if there are couple even more out there ideas in the movie that force it more and more down to below average score ', ' subpar bond that believes it has emotional stakes isn exactly very winning formula far too much bad mcu banter to go with something that wants to be grounded and quite frankly none of the actors are quite adapt at those sitcomy whedonisms that these movies made mainstream pugh in particular is terrible at those bits some of the mid section action is better than average as far as those movies goes but anything with taskmasker is very bad and the big end is terrible winstone villain made me miss when people like lonsdale and lee made lousy moore bond plots half watchable the major limitation is that far too much of the emotional beats depend on what characters talk about their time together when they were pretend family and altough johansson and pugh have good chemistry and weisz and harbour do as good job as possible under the circunstances of selling their regrets there just isn enough downtime between plot needs to anything of it truly land can get what shortland was hoping to import into one of those but little actually works even with the benefit of far more standalone movie than most of them also strange how after decade of postponing giving johansson her movie they did one in which she so often feels like witness connective mcu tissue for the main supporting characters family drama that they had to give her an extra subplot with her guilty over killing winstone daughter so it can feel like she has more material to work with she is both the lead and the most extraneous part of her own movie ', ' after decent first season and an awesome second one this show has plummeted to the very bottom season 3 is as much chore to suffer through as the new jessica jones season even vincent usual fantastic performance can save this the characters have reached new pathetic low and are in fierce competition with each other for greatest guilt or being the biggest screw up matt visions pointless flashbacks and the mother plot point does nothing but take up time apart from adding even more self pity and guilt fingers crossed the show is cancelled after this ', ' this quick clip after the avengers is actually kind of interesting it is short so not lot of stuff is happening but it actually is when you think about it the new characters in claire ben and agent blake are interesting enough but am glad the sitwell was able to sort of prove that he is capable physical agent lizzy caplan and titus welliver are joy on any screen and they hope they can make an appearance what really makes this interesting to me is that there are people in the world using alien technology for their own benefit this is most likely happening lot around the world and due to this damage control an entity created to literally clean up messes can be introduced caplan and welliver sitwell does more people get alien technology could be problem in the future damage control not long enough 7 8 10 ', ' black widow shows how talented its actors are that and the action scenes however aren enough to make this great movie this movie is also bit pointless especially with where romanoff story went in endgame ', ' good move to bring your 9 year old kids to funny with lot of 90 refrences in it but when it comes to plot and character development it falls way short good graphics funny gags but overall captain marvel deserves better lot better ', ' can believe that teenagers are this childish and living in their own fantasy world like dumb kid but like the artwork of this series and the cultural diversity ', ' lesser mission impossible type of film and nothing more is not even in the same league as other mcu films and series for the most part like the characters and the general idea is fine but is just surface level on all its aspects it lacks dimension and finesse is not work of art is just mild blockbuster and to be absolutely clear is not the actors fault but everything else is just meh proven director should be chosen for this first instalment ', ' no substance movie just for the sake of movie it like scarjo forgot to act or something maybe she works only when she with avengers the movie and the plot could have been better ', ' seasons 1 and 3 contain elite storytelling while season 2 is bit uneven it still introduces strong new characters who push the story in fascinating directions the antagonists in this series are richly developed both in their own journey and how they relate to the title character and story the acting is world class despite most not being household names at the time the series was created as bonus it a story that manages to tap into religious themes without being preachy or judgmental while ve generally been fan of disney taking over marvel as whole so that we can get connecting universe this show being victim of those decisions is real consequence m sincerely holding the born again series can recapture just 80 of the juice that this series had ', ' worst film have ever seen marvel put out scarlett was done wrong by this film for origins story worst thing to happen my 2yr old could have come up with better story line don even have 2yr old wow absolutely horrible ', ' am fan of marval work but what expected and what got is very different in this series it just promoting one religion wanted good thriller comedy marval actors good though ', ' black widow might be my favorite avengers movie to date and it not just because it loaded with babes the story feels different than the typical masculine macho comic book action movie the beginning of the movie seems more like james bond spy thriller but with emotions and family bonding and drama and this family emotional bonding continues throughout the movie all the way to the end of the credits definitely continue to watch past the end credits like with all marvel movies there are some funny comic relief especially when black widow little sister pokes fun of how black widow always poses when she lands and this poking fun is repeated few times love it setting very nice settings around the world love it plot nice plot with some twists character development great to see the characters develop this movie is character driven climax resolution nicely done the action like most actions movies are very good great special effects pq reference quality as expected since the movie was shot using 8k digital cameras sq typical of about 99 of marvel movies overall sq is very good there are some decent atmos overhead effects but nowhere near reference quality for atmos definitely want black widow in 4k atmos this is the type of movie would re watch repeatedly can see potential black widow sequels ', ' too childish pakistani struggle too much at english and kamala has swiflty rushed english but main point is its too childish dont think any 16 year old kid dream or think like that ', ' the avengers was directed by joss whedon and stars roberty downey jr chris evans and tom hiddlesticks hiddleston if it actually bothers you it the end result of 5 previous movies combined into one awesome spectacular entry to the marvel cinematic universe when charming likable british villain tries to attack earth with his giant disposable cgi space army forcing some mentor like figure to form super team consisting of the protagonists from 5 completely separate movies rolled into one and thus we have cinematic universe thanks feige your brilliance had doomed us all the avengers is one of the most likable enjoyable fun action superhero movies that ever been released and redefined genre without this movie all the cinematic universes we have today wouldn exist the debate on whether that good or not is still open and superhero movie on this scale would have been attempted don watch this movie expecting the dark knight or men because this movie centres fun as its 1 goal and excels at it all the cast is likable the action is fun and it is overall just great big fun way to spend 2 hours of you life as much as praise this movie it does have some flaws the main flaw is the dull generic and clich ridden story which is just really poorly written it follows the tropes way too closely and began the trend to have no stakes in marvel movies will also say the ending should have had more of an impact and felt more important than it was so would definitely say it should have been handled better the end credits sequences are gold though robert downey jr is excellent as iron man and is easily the best part of the mcu on the flip side of this will say that was very disappointed in chris evan captain america and think his blatant lack of emotion and all times is unsettling and boring to watch understand the need of straight man to keep the group in check but he was more like robot than human hiddlesticks was phenomenal as loki and remains as easily the best mcu villain he smart he charming and most importantly he british that must be requirement on entry to the super villain squad because every villain in the universe is british or at least the good ones are scarlett johanson was good as black widow and you can see genuine emotion between her and hawkeye she may not be critical member of the team but she a female and yay for diversity mark ruffallo was great as bruce banner and adore how he refers to his alter ego as the other guy jeremy renner was fine as hawkeye and remains the most useful avenger with his sick archery skills seriously though he doesn need to exist chris hemsworth was good as thor but not particularly memorable samuel jackson is great as nick fury and 15 rated movie of him would be comedy gold the cinematography for this movie is great and adore the tracking shots whedon uses in the action and think it benefits the action so much whedon can do action supremely well the effects are amazing and are delight to look at the costume design was great and the set design was also really good this movie needed to provide some fun action sequences be funny and bring one of the most iconic superhero teams to the big screen without getting crucified by die hard marvel fans can speak for two of them factors and say it achieved them as for the third one can comment but will assume they were happy in conclusion this is undoubtedly one of the best comic book movies of all time and is just great fun to watch if you haven seen this movie highly recommend you do because it is pure adrenaline filled enjoyment 9 10 ', ' as someone who loves the ms marvel comic and was skeptical about her powers in the show love it am surprised but they have don a great job with it so far can wait for the next episodes ', ' this second installment makes the original captain marvel look like cinematic masterpiece nothing about this movie works although brie larson acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn want to be there for this at all further when you break it down there is really no story at all happening in fact the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was conflict in the first place so much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest samuel jackson character nick fury is hardly even shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief the scenes don really mesh together at all none of them are really necessary to advancing plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle the villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided very brief backstory overall she never feels like too much of threat there one part in particular that think is absolutely candidate for worst sequence of 2023 without spoiling it it is essentially planet that looks like cheap rip off of the wizard of oz it just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene there been lot of less than stellar work from marvel since endgame but this is reaching new depths m not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song please loki reset the entire timeline ', ' plowing through season one she could have ended the kilgrave situation in one episode unfortunately dumb plans wasted opportunities and poor judgement have been her hinderance don get why she didn kill him at the first available opportunity it not like she captain america she more like deadpool just take him out of the equation kilgrave is making her look stupid ll keep watching it has very high online ratings hopefully m missing something and it will get better ', ' reading the reviews here 2 days ago got me slightly worried but after watching in the cinema the imax 3d version have to say that the people who rated 1 3 either didn even see the movie or had expectations that are unjustifiable in my opinion the acting is top notch as expected and the story explained pretty much everything that we needed to know who is she why is she so powerful personally had blast watching the movie and wasn at all bothered with the feminist agenda that some people found sooo annoying as matter of fact it is hardly noticable beyond the fact that the protagonist is female and why would you have problem with that ', ' uninspired high gloss kiddie comic adaption with acceptable visual effects and screenplay that fits on one sheet of toilet paper it is almost incredible how this movie could be so highly rated must be indebted by the target group which exists from nerd comic fans and teenagers without an clue what makes good movie the characters are flat and as result none of the normaly good actors is capable of convincing what left is the typical action loaded special effects spectacle but even in this category nothing is extraordinary or surprising let hope that someone saves us from sequel is hard to underbid that ', ' couldn really get into the show when it was being released but now after few years went back to it to try and finish it from finishing the show can say that it was very fun to watch some scenes dragged out will say the characters had nice development from what saw the visuals and the music are good the team did good job and this ', ' first seriously film of the marvel cinematic universe really beautiful and very nice light the right and heavy in the right moments really great movie ', ' finally something that gets back to the heart and soul of what marvel has been but seems to have lost more recently it also to me feels like one of the most real and grounded shows and much more of reflection of our real world ve seen people trashing this as kids show if it not for you then it not for you but would ask why spiderman is not considered kids show and this is even though the ages are roughly the same something to consider there in any event am definitely not kid or teenager and found this show to be highly relatable on family dynamic level on personal identity level and on trying to understand your background level in contrast hawkeye left me out in the cold for the first few episodes this show captured me from the first episode some of that also has to do with the really creative presentation in the first few episodes that captured comics vibe and also kamala khan energy and imagination on the screen loved it it was fresh and something we have not seen before m glad the writers fought to get it in when marvel pushed against it being in do wish however that it got brought back more than it did in the last episode to kind of merge where kamala was at the beginning of the story and her growth and this gets to why so very much wish could give this 10 10 but can the clandestines storyline was not fully developed and there are major questions that remained for us to guess including as to aisha and najma and najma and kamran this does not appear to be the writers fault as apparently they had written lot on the clandestines but then were shoved into what appears to now be the standard 6 episode format this show is one that really could have used one more episode or longer fifth and sixth episode to address that and here is where have message for marvel and disney if you re going to take time and money to tell story let the story be told stop forcing it into some arbitrary time box otherwise what is the point you leave plot gaps and questions hanging for the viewer that leave unsatisfaction and uncertainty especially when it not clear that the questions are going to be answered in future installment if you re tired of seeing the same stories over and over on screen this show is more than welcome break from that creative colorful funny but also very meaningful and deep at points also loved getting to see culture different than mine on screen and learning about it including the historical events that affect many families today thank you to those who made this show not just to make story but to have it be labor of love it shows ', ' this show is just filled with cringe acting childish doesn feel like the mcu at all it so boring no interesting scene or fight that will raise ur eye brown it just not special it has nothing in it to make it not just decent mcu series buh decent show in general ', ' this movie was terrible bad editing was just symptom of the problems in this really really badly produced edited and written film miss marvel was the best character in the movie and she had like 4 good scenes there is nothing redeeming about this horrible jumbled heap of film disney do better have no clue how this made it out of the editing in post guess they dumped way too much money into it to drop this all together the writers and directors failed and this move needs to make at least billion to break even on good day captain mavel had few decent moments where she didn seem like she was made by chipetto miss marvel was alright at times and the rest were wastes of memory card on that camera its miss and garbage film ', ' many people looked forward to this film and what we got felt like the last half of story too much of the early film was spent on backstory and flashbacks too much unexplained which would have better grounded the viewer in the story and it not bad thing to ground the viewers in the story and as happens in many of these movies the characters are unreasonably immune to injury natasha probably suffered life ending injuries several times she walked away from the movie wasn a waste there were so good action scenes and few amusing moments but it could and should have been so much more ', ' cgi and action scenes that about it normally can get into the comic book movies but this one simply bored me m honestly curious as to how at the time of this review this dreadful thing has rating of 6 8 this was over 2 hours of meh ', ' here is another good example of how spending huge amount on movie does not guarantee that you will make good movie many much much better movies have been made at fraction of the cost of this debacle the writing is nonsensical and the direction woeful so it is now wonder that the acting is third rate thinking back to those very good tongue in cheek performances in the early marvel movies think iron man you wonder what has happened to the franchise the actors here take themselves much too seriously and in the process overact to the point of comedy all in all this is real mess ', ' initially was excited because m from south asia so had high hopes but found this one the worst among all the marvel series movies the main character doesn look convincing at all couldn bear even the pilot episode it was boring and even the concept is not that good ', ' loved the story really felt it developed the characters and moved the entire mcu multiverse forward in coherent and intelligent manner loved the character arcs thought they added depth to each person and the family scenes were hilarious and so true to family dynamics and back story fill ins were useful and sensibly written as well as meaningful and sensitive overall would recommend have not enjoyed marvel in the cinema since end game and ve seen all of them this one loved and left the cinema with real buzz thinking about the follow up movies can wait to see the next generation of powerful and heroic women ', ' mean how can they just approve such flimsy and immature movie plot to get the green light from marvel executives just the worst experience watching marvel movie never felt so let down while watching marvel movie and yes have watched all of them ', ' the punisher is an awesome superhero show that isn really superhero show frank castle is former marine seeking justice for what happened to his family jon bernthal done phenomenal job as frank castle and nobody else will ever be able to replace him ', ' almost as boring as the first captain america movie one of the worst in all marvel history sadly ', ' possible spoilers joss whedon the avengers is cinematic juggernaut that effortlessly blends spectacle and character this ensemble masterpiece masterfully brings together disparate group of heroes and forges them into formidable team the film greatest strength lies in its character dynamics the witty banter between iron man and captain america the brooding intensity of the hulk and the god like arrogance of thor create vibrant tapestry of personalities each avenger brings their unique strengths and flaws to the table making them relatable and compelling robert downey jr charismatic portrayal of tony stark serves as the perfect glue holding the team together with his quick wit and leadership the film action sequences are nothing short of exhilarating the battle of new york is visual spectacle that showcases the power and coordination of the avengers the film pacing is impeccable balancing the character driven moments with high octane action tom hiddleston loki is charismatic and menacing villain who provides the necessary conflict his complex relationship with thor adds depth to the story and elevates the stakes the film ending with the avengers standing united against common enemy is triumphant moment that cements their status as earth mightiest heroes the avengers is landmark achievement in the superhero genre setting new standard for ensemble films it a thrilling ride that satisfies on every level leaving audiences eager for more adventures with their favorite heroes ', ' this movie was fantastic enjoyed larson character and acting she was confident and feisty with good heart and rogue streak and she was fun she played around she had some of that young soldier wants to prove themselves mentality impulsivness yet which you see develop and expect to see lot more depth and maturity of character in her next appearance yet with the same light hearted fun to her personality also lol to reviews saying she didnt show enough emotion when she is repeatedly told to curb her emotion during her training and she is supposed to he serious soldier like character yet that also has lot of fun the movie rang as true superhero origin story not the most original in the world and they all have cliches but was made up for in details dialogue and actor chemistry gotta say look at critic and user rating disparity dont always agree with critics but it is rare to see that high of disparity and the low ratings might have to do with being threatened by new era of female led superheroes movies you wont see that admited in the reviews but the details of the lower end ratings just dont make sense did we watch the same movie please put down your expectations see it for yourself and make up your own mind ', ' the avengers is the best summer blockbuster for long time it balances all elements of fun drama action special effects multiple egos into well directed paced movie the film has perfectly edited action set pieces no fast editing like say transformers and it benefits hugely the first 30 minutes are fairly slow build up but after that the last hour especially is amazing credit has to go to the director you really can tell he has love for the source material and gets all the characters to interact and each share their own moments throughout the film the drama is not as dark as say the dark knight as people have been saying it is very funny film with some laugh out moments the avengers is simply amazing hollywood is in for bumper year this year with so many high profile releases yet to come the dark knight rises spider man skyfall the hobbit the avengers has started the summer blockbuster season with bang and may end up being the best of them all in 2012 highly recommend the avengers ', ' m really sad for the main actress because she clearly doing her best and it quite good but the way the show and her character were written is abysmal it very childish and boring that a shame because visually it really well done hate the fact that they changed her powers and by the way no captain marvel did not solo thanos far from it ', ' not only did this movie have slow start it hardly kept my attention throughout the movie the acting was fine just didn find the new characters very likable nor did care what happened to them as the movie progressed with the pandemic they had plenty of time to iron out flaws or issues with the movie and it didnt present itself that way if anything it seemed rushed ', ' as middle aged cis white guy who grew up with the house that stan and jack built have enjoyed the entire mcu so far from endgame and civil war to the dark world and the incredible hulk however have been reluctant to show them to my pre tween daughter until now we watched the first episode of ms marvel and both of us really liked it finally there was hero with whom young girl could identify what captain marvel did for older females kamala khan can do for the younger generations one thing we found particularly enjoyable was the use of the backgrounds to enhance embellish what was happening in the story it was very reminiscent of one of my daughter favorite recent films the mitchells vs the machines like that film ms marvel has strong family theme incredibly creative graphics and an adorkable lead thank you disney for providing series we can enjoy together ', ' liked the ghostrider character few seasons back but now the show needs to do gimmicks like time travel and other hacked plot tropes to deal with lack of interesting characters especially the coulsen one time to cancel this series ', ' the punisher is well known anti hero among other superheroes in marvel universe but this series is not part of disney mcu at least for now the punisher has not any kind of super abilities unlike most of the marvel characters although don read much comic books had known the character from its earlier movie adaptations since watched the 2004 version in my childhood it is special character for me before start to watch this series was kind of hesitant to start because was dissapointed so many works that are released in netflix but fortunately this series matched with my expectations castings were great choices in the series had already known jon bernthal from movies like snitch wolf of wall street and the last year ford ferrari and generally and he was playing supportive characters in this series jon bernthal carries the show with his performance as frank castle amber rose ben barnes jason moore also were good in their performances as supportive characters although didn know them before the series really satisfied with their performances violence dose was satisfying because we know that the punisher is very merciless character when he needs to be action scenes mostly were successful too on the other hand must mention the things that didn like firstly after 1st season finale the creators stretched 1st season plot to the second season and it is kind of cheap move in terms of scenario villains of the series are very cliche so they lack the depth in terms of compelling villains frank billy and curtis characters could have had more screen time when they were in the army in the second season if ignore plot holes must mention that dr durmont actions don make sense at all and in 2nd season screenwriters were sucked in some ways won give any detail because every action genre watcher should see the series it has rare quality among most netflix productions if someone wants to watch an action series and he has netflix subscription the punisher is one of the best options can suggest to that audience ', ' harboring great deal of expectation of this record breaking multi superhero in row action mash up finally caught up the last chance to watch it on the big screen but unfortunately the film has indomitably become my very first disappointment in 2012 alerted by the general opinion of if you can survive the boring first 60 minutes the latter part will blow you away maybe boring is lesser word the inter conversations among these superheroes are way too tedious to arouse any interest and in light of my last encounter with thor 2011 know he is boredom then here comes his worsen twin captain america so it is dumb and dumber situation most of characters are reprising their usual roles robert downey jr sleekness is being harnessed into its maximum quota so assume the only revelation could come from jeremy renner hawkeye the newcomer on screen and the third candidate of hulk mark ruffalo but the truth is they might be clear torrent but cannot save this juggernaut from being destroy it all dross the fighting scenes are the saving grace here which is not false claim but it satisfies my eyes without compensates my soul director joss whedon just haphazardly levels everything in manhattan without any single casualty provided to imply its minimum credibility no worries at all we simply witnessed an empty and meaningless catastrophe without any mind activity as we all know iron man will not be the sacrifice as sequel is already set on release date thus am over demanding here after the invasion of myriads of this sort of big budget action flicks the avengers is no way standout by any means none of its actors could stick out with any arresting existence might be too desperate to count out gwyneth paltrow mark ruffalo is the closest choice of decent acting in it all the rest is just the way he or she is an utterly featherweight character study is the case here the gags are scarce ooh poor loki too much sci fi doctrines and the narrative in dead earnest thanks to you mr samuel jackson makes the film lengthy screen time too overt to be slighted and waited until the end credit rolled over but second bonus scenes never show off the film huge success has baffled me so much and its staggering status of the third biggest grossing film of all time after avatar 2009 and titanic 1997 does make me do some solemn post mortem to question my taste the conclusion could be that may be detached from the majority liking which thankfully believe heralds good sign for me right ', ' as say in the title if you enjoyed the captain marvel movie you should enjoy this it not work of art but enjoyed it much more than lot of the recent marvel movies and it is lot more even than some of the recent ones it very character driven the three main characters are delightful and had seen wandavision and ms marvel to understand who monica rambeau and kamala khan were but my wife hadn and seemed to enjoy it too no explanations of powers required you could see them the opening is bit confusing but it was confusing for the characters too so that makes more sense and the 3 characters soon settled in as team the story was basic but made sense and the antagonist was so so nick fury was bit low key so it was really the marvels film which was nice seeing kamala family again was great too definitely enjoyed it and it will be one of the marvel films probably will watch on repeat lot yes there is brief part with species who speak in song but we have one of the best star trek tng episodes with species who speak in allegories so m glad ignored the low ratings because d heard the if you liked captain marvel you ll like this comment from multiple sources that value and totally agree ', ' would never label marvel film as uninteresting except for the first two thor installments but this needless chapter gets close while the mcu has never revolutionized the wheel in terms of storytelling there at least has always been sense of discovery and progression black widow only spins its wheels doling out the same tired formula that has continually plagued the solo installments of the ever expanding universe director cate shortland embraces the spy genre but doesn offer anything interesting with the unlimited budget and talent at her disposal with her greatest sin being the absolute wasting of ray winstone as one of the most pathetic mcu villains already low bar to begin with fortunately the introduction of florence pugh as yelena offers some semblance of hope in this new age of heroes ', ' without doubt the best comic book based show more sophisticated with more credible story line than arrow which is also over the top with toxic saccharine melodramatics and the top heavy fantastical plot of the flash plus no irritating exhausting nauseating prolonged super hero romance crap that saturates arrow and the flash stellar performances by the entire cast and sigh no annoying characters you pray will meet their demise sorry but there are couple characters in arrow and the flash that annoy me like wearing heavy wool coat in the sahara and am not talking about villains this is why ditched marvel agents of h i d beats the crap out of the dragged out yawn gotham although am not big fan of violence the fight scenes are executed excuse the pun beautifully although few are bit too graphic for my taste the show just gets better with every episode and am rabid for the premiere of season two cannot come soon enough ', ' expected wonder woman we got black widow felt like there was too much of unnecessary family drama added most of the film felt like very normal family reunion comedy drama action sequences were also average may be need more comics education to completely understand the film and the plot ', ' picture scenes storylines are dull but worse acting is really is really have been trying to watch over the years have really been trying know these are parallel plots to the main storylines but honestly feels like watching bad start trek series made nearly exclusively of time wasting conversations even entire episodes false feelings cheap sets smart strong girls and weak men who simply stand still all the time with their arms straight and cheap costumes but also there are clich like angry baddies dressed in black raising their fists in anger and with earings on top of this there is below average to simply bad acting depending on actors honestly it hurts to watch good luck ', ' tbh never thought that marvel can portray brown ppl in such fascinating way and it hard to say about the bc in starting of first two episodes marvel mostly tries to give the character background so guess it the same case here so bombing bad wouldn work bc everyone know about the show and hate it get from neighbors at the end ppl think it for kid but in my opinion it also an amazing show for mature audience so must watch this series ', ' the best superhero movie nuff said highly recommended movie for everyone go watch it you will not regret it the action the jokes the script the special effects the story the characters the actors actresses especially scarlett johansson she so hot and gorgeous are perfect one of the best movies of 2012 my expectations for this movie was exceeded will certainly watch the sequel of this movie to see black widow again can believe 2 hrs and 20 mins passed do fast did not get bored on this movie at all cause was so into this movie cause it so fantastic will see this movie again perfect for me 10 10 ', ' personal bias will always bring out strong opinions and would defend to the death the rights of the naysayers to leave their subjectivity low ratings that said for me thought the movie was wonderfully poignant and it filled just the right amount of backstory to make it tie in to the franchise without loss of continuity also loved the casting the screenplay and the use of humour to humanise the superhero aspect of the tie in movies brilliant ', ' should start off by saying am long time marvel comic reader and fan and what have noticed more than anything in regard to the comics is clear downward trajectory in regard to writing in the last 15 years the writing has gone downhill to the point where am not even sure downhill is strong enough term new characters are largely copies of older characters with young bright eyed and often flawless kids taking on copycat roles of established characters they tend not to have any depth they tend to be politically motivated and stereotypical cliches not good characters but representative characters instead of being individually unique they tend to be broadly representative which makes them quite dull and 1 dimensional there is no qualitative standard the writing is amateurish at best in reality this is closer to fan fiction in fact it much worse than lot of fan fiction the marvel rising series is everything that bad about the recent run of comics shoved in to one awful animated series want to make it clear it not problem that the series is aimed at children it not problem they use new characters it a problem that they use terribly fleshed out and written characters without depth and who come off more like sex in the city characters than real human beings and personally think that makes this awful for kids if you want your kids learning stereotypes perceiving lack of human depth as positive character trait or if you want children to feel the need to fit into one of these stereotypes rather than being complete and individual human beings guess this is the show for you the writing is even for children show awful the dialogue is poor the character development is non existent and they largely deal with extremely superficial and vain problems it really feels like the show was written by 17 year olds for shallow 15 year olds rather than growing and maturing children their lives are largely based around getting coffee and complaining about how hard it is to balance being superhero and doing your schoolwork not exactly the ideal role models really this show is the epitome of everything that sent comic sales into downward spiral the disney aspect shines through in the worst corporate and shallow way have said shallow enough because this series is beyond shallow and it not just light pop centric fun with good writing like say the original buffy the vampire slayer series it probably not even as well written as show like 90210 or an animation like teen titans go which does everything right that marvel rising does wrong if this is the future of marvel animated products marvel animation might not have much of future at all would keep this show away from my children not because it covers topics that are to mature or content that isn appropriate but because it will make your children dumber and teach them that poor writing and seeing human beings as stereotypes and representative archetypes is positive thing and those are really really not positive things their names and individual identities are completely secondary to their cliched personas they could have just as easily named their characters red haired and friendly teen male or hot tempered latina if that what you think will help your kids grow and mature and become confident in who they are then by all means but god help the future of our species have all the talented writers retired or do they just hire complete amateurs now ', ' have heard lots of folks complaining that this show has been review bombed so gave it the benefit of the doubt but tbh we are now watching episode 5 m typing this as we watch it slow origin story really want to care but the characters are bit one dimensional we have literally watched everything marvel but this is the weakest so far ', ' had pretty high expectations for this film going into it thought for sure that marvel was trying to make powerful move out of the gate after endgame spider man far from home was as refreshing and fun as homecoming started to see that marvel had hit quality stride could count on in comparison this black widow movie was hard to watch and frankly they shouldn have even made it really liked black widow throughout the mcu and wintersoldier was probably the best film featuring her but this feels like it trying very hard to make social point rather than tell truly compelling story featuring larger than life super soldiers my absolute favourite part was david harbour his role is relatively small but it was fascinating think it was huge misopportunity to give him bigger role so he could really show off his strengths one glaring problem of this movie was humour almost all of its humour was misplaced and eye rolling wonder if the story might actually be good but needed to be told by director who knew how it should be told if you re an mcu fan don watch this movie if you like good movies don watch this movie ', ' if you go into this like it is american adult cartoon similar to familyguy americandad southpark venturebros boondocks then this probably will feel like 11 out of 10 if you go into this like it is japanese anime afrosamurai samurai champloo cowboy bebop or marvel movie avengers captain america ironman get ready to be disappointed and just skip this no need to leave rating if you are not familiar with any of the above give it try but be warned everything about it is so basic it is not doing anything new at best it was 5 out of 10 and you probably could watch something better ', ' poor plot bad cgi bad acting bad soundtrack end ', ' delightful show with an engaging young star that showcases creative spirit not only is it believable show about young superheroes there a definite charm well worth the watch for the young and old ', ' think this is just marketing keep people close to the marvel universe to increase sales when movies come out as series it comparable to avengers assemble or ultimate spiderman yes m comparing it to cartoons except it 40min long and is not cartoon when it comes to comedy plot and overall quality that where it stands show for kids why do say that it sounds kinda mean well don mean to be mean it fine if people like that and the only way can compare it to cartoons is if watch them right when it comes to tastes there no discussion but here why m giving 5 10 when watch cartoons expect cartoons and when watch live action shows expect interesting well thought plots with good acting let start with the plot it starts ok but parallel stories and the need to stay on par with the movies quickly introduces problems on the plot that question it capacity to be believable and here why it comparable to cartoons movie comes out and the characters quickly change focus and forget what happened in the previous episode some secondary actor from the movies finally agrees to make cameo and everybody drops their pants to welcome him her once again lost focus and memory from previous episodes let move on to acting and focus bit more on characters fitz and the girl are good pair much like those rapper style buddy autobots on the second transformers movie they re kinda funny kinda emotional they re ok not real agents as they re practically defenseless but it more interesting that way they re the lab guys like in csi except csi guys probably have more training and aren just fresh out of high school room to grow guess still ok ward and skye jesus christ put some salt one those guys they re tasteless mean the asian american woman has that romanoff black widow thing going on but these guys make me yawn they seem like nice people m not saying it the actor fault maybe they need an interesting story and just in case writer for the show is reading this making characters sleep together is not original and is not surprising unless you kinda build the tension or make it weird situation but there are none of those in agents of h e d so don even think about it let just finish character analysis with coulson we all love this guy but given the rest of the show kinda have the feeling this was all just to keep him alive just look at loki and how much face time he got in the dark world just because he had lots of fans after his first appearance in the iron man movies coulson was included in cartoons games the avengers movie has an important agent and now this show finally and this is not necessarily problem but definitely minus for me the teasing they tease so much about the core avengers thor hulk cap and even nick fury but they re never delivered look thor touched this let rub our faces in it and try to absorb some of his success oh my god oh my god oh my god can smell hulk it not like we can expect to see these characters or any major fighting sequences with them but argh guess it works as marketing campaign ', ' am not sure if we have superhero movie fatigue or maybe the timing for this movie was just bad when saw the trailer for this movie already knew that it was going to be bad had problem with number of areas in this film the cgi and vfx in general looked very cheap it looked like series in some scenes the costumes in some scenes looked really bad usually marvel has the best looking super hero costumes on screen the script was terrible or possible the execution of the script was terrible the actors were all great they did their part but there nothing they could have done to save bad production my rating is for the actors if it wasn for them this movie would be solid 1 star as to how this movie received an average over 7 makes no sense whatsoever ', ' as an 18 year old am nowhere near this shows target demographic that isnt to say didn enjoy it as you can tell by my rating liked it thought the characters were fun and new and breath of fresh air this is more like saturday cartoon version of the mcu movies with more childish view on the franchise all in all enjoyed it ', ' waited while to see the movie used gift card to watch because didnt want to put my own money to this as standard marvel movie it ticks the good boxes with the blend of humor action and plot it an alright movie just not the best it could have been admittedly brie isn terrible in this she does deliver some of the goods as it comes to being believable hero that why m actually writing review whilst don care for her views was still entertained by the movie the overall plot was pretty concise it was predictable but still good entry into the marvel collection it helped define few grey areas left by guardians and the other movies dealing with shield nothing major but good filler material in terms of backstory and general history of the franchise end credit scenes and all the supporting cast did well we saw different fury than what we re used to and different coulson the movie shed light on some of the other characters from previous movies again harkening back to my earlier mention of guardians decided to see this because as most of us are somewhat vested in the franchise we ve seen all the other movies in the theaters at least once we ve followed the films from the start never expecting it to get to these stages to those like me that still like the movies even if we dislike the points of views from the actors d say still see this movie just try to have someone else pay for your ticket or use gift card from someone if you want to soothe your moral compunctions ', ' finally found mcu content dislike was starting to think anything they did was master piece even enjoyed eternals but couldn watch this show really tried but found it extremely uninteresting hawkeye had been by far my least favorite until now would rate hawkeye 5 10 but this show makes hawkeye look amazing hope this characters doesn come back am ok with this show existing so kids below 10 can enjoy it but am really afraid this will ruin mcu if this character is important in upcoming movies honestly wish could give this 0 or lower extremely didn enjoy it ', ' am one of the biggest fans of marvel have watched everything that they have created since 2008 and love them but this show has got to be their worst creation so far the show is all over the place with stereotypic references and bad acting it clearly shows the lack of insight of the creators the dialogues are pretty bad as well its as if someone desperately tried to write something inspiring and ended up with this just can complain enough about the acting its almost painful to watch the marvel title card of this show ', ' black widow is grounded quieter origin story for natasha romanoff which will satisfy fans of the character it is smaller scaled in terms of action spectacle but fans who care about black widow will appreciate the character development black widow fills in the missing narrative gaps for its title character between all the avengers films we learn about natasha romanoff dark past in russia before she joined the avengers in the first avengers black widow talks about having red on her ledger and that is dealt with here in dramatically satisfying manner which retroactively deepens her story arc from infinity war the idealist in me wishes this origin story was told earlier and wasn an afterthought on the marvel timeline director cate shortland who has background in indie dramas brings more delicate touch that veers away from the usual marvel aesthetic the cinematography is shot in an intimate fashion that pulls up close to the actor faces which translates to bourne identity shaky quick cut style in the fight scenes the musical score takes its cue from old political thrillers overall the film feels more intimate and hand made there are fewer jokes something which appreciated black widow is not comedy in fact it one of the more tonally serious marvel installments the few gags that are there do land and function more like tension breakers than comedic quips scarlett johansson delivers solid performance in her final outing her portrayal here feels like johannson own vision of the character natasha is not dressed or photographed in an overtly sexual way she just is capable avenger solving her own problems the natasha in this film is much more vulnerable than we ve seen before it seems like the note johannson wants to leave on and she accomplishes that david harbour as the red guardian russian version of captain america who is forsaken by his country was funny as the comedy relief his character left more to be desired it is florence pugh who steals the show as yelena belova she brings gravitas and communicates her character dimensions under limited screentime quickly establishing herself as the most compelling new marvel character post infinity war the sister story between natasha and yelena was well executed look forward to seeing pugh next outing as yelena like in most superhero fare black widow struggles between what the film is thematically about versus the commercial expectations it has to deliver the family drama between johansson pugh harbour and weisz is easily the best part with all the commercial box ticking the film is too overwhelmed to sink its teeth in exploring this broken family dynamic at one point william hurt thaddeus ross who is chasing natasha romanoff for crimes against the sokova accords feels more like representation of the disney marvel conglomerate chasing down scarlett johansson as she sneakily weaves an arthouse family drama beneath this superhero movie the film could have used fewer action sequences and traded that time for more dramatic scenes of the family working out their issues there were few fights that seemed unmotivated and am sure the director would undoubtedly agree marvel studios has gotten the whole world to care about all these characters now everybody now sits so obediently waiting for the end credits scene we ve seen science aliens gods and magic marvel has us in the seats already they can really wow us with more feels ', ' horrible storyline extremely boring awful acting one of the worst marvel movies out there very disappointed big waste of money ', ' ll try to keep this as neutral as possible mostly because both enjoyed and didn enjoy this first episode of aos the kid in me loved it but that was purely from the fact that it was about superheroes or at least about heroes in general the rest of me thought it was poorly written and the acting was not as good as would have expected from blockbuster tv series throughout most of the episode it seemed as if different people had different ideas of what should happen or how this caused it to play out like badly written skits thrown together there were more than few instances of really cheesy one liners some funny some not yet the parts that were supposed to be funny seemed to lack something in the delivery whether that was due to the actors directors or writers m not sure there were also few instances of horribly obvious sexual innuendos which felt really out of place when it comes down to it it seems as though even the show doesn know what it should be comedy action or drama it tries to do them all yet fails on all accounts yes it made me laugh few times but it was like laughing at bad joke the action was short and looked as though they spent very little time with choreographer and the drama just felt flat mostly because they broke it up with the attempts at trying to be funny ll continue to watch it suspect it will get better but m not going to hold my breath for right now this show will pale in comparison to the blacklist ', ' this is the standard that all epic and high budget television should be judged against season 1 was great but season 2 is just next level amazing the punisher was cast perfectly and that prison fight season whoa season 3 was little disappointing if only because it took sort of strange turn and bullseye never really got chance to shine but all in all this is one of the greatest series of all time just wish they would have made one more season to fully realize all of its potential ', ' let me start by saying this is not intended for adults everything about this show is aimed for kids to teens it cheesy silly like disney and nick life on shows are for that age but watching it with my engage daughter was easy enough because it was family quality time but not show would have watched without on my own and think it wonderful the inclusion of another culture and race into mainstream tv without it being stereotype casting enjoyed seeing nuances that had little understanding of all that means is need to learn more and again think that why the show was meant for much younger audience that has more flexible minds and not engrained in stereotypes by fox news good job disney ', ' this film seemed rushed weird lines that didnt work characters you just couldnt care about ronin the accuser is new actor and super lame lots of parts had the marvel feel but the acting and or directing just couldnt bring it reminded me of pre iron man era kinda ok but at least its marvel movie so disappointed best part is the cat and jude law did the best he could ', ' it a disney series that borrows from the marvel license to create something more in line with what company traditionally does and to be fair it does it well it likely to marvel fans will cut it some slack because of that as the show so far is rather clever in it execution ', ' went to see this with 3 other adults 3 kids all of us really enjoyed the film and delivers what we have come to expect from marvel film when new characters are introduced the films tend to be slow to start as the background is built up but always end in style which is what this films does saw no overt feminist agenda but if those less enlightened think that the presence of more than one female central character is overtly feminist then it just goes to show how much further there is to go lovely humour good gathering pace cannot wait for endgame ', ' this show has it all history increase in knowledge about culture don know enough about heart soul great editing great cast the different music at the end of each episode was outstanding great direction and the constant colorful visuals are just the icing on the cake the whole show is like looking into colorful kaleidoscope and joy to see don think ve ever seen anything in popular culture that addresses the history of india and pakistan for general audiences to be able to understand this was especially good for younger audiences to understand history of that area and the total devastation that the families and neighbors experienced in this region it is delivered in creative no preachy manner entwined within creative story that along with the story of the giin made for and interesting and fascinating story filled with lore and facts the actors were great all of them and the lead actor is extremely engaging with her innocence and determination there was no true nastiness in them and even the bad guys were redeemed or redeemable ultimately it had the morality slant of older films which has been lost over the years to muddier muckier sense of right and wrong it was actually quite excellent and goes along with the new breed of disney shows that include women who are not background to men but primary characters told with the input of women it was delightful ', ' being pakistani and growing up on hindi movies and pakistani dramas makes me nostalgic watching this show find it so enjoyable for the whole family fun witty very south asian everyone from grandpa to my 7 year old daughter are enjoying the show can wait for more episodes ', ' the worst mcu series ever seen waist of time poor writing mediocre acting undeveloped characters slow and boring show is made for the pre teen marvel fan ', ' brilliant the best part is that the actor fits the character so well it all seems so natural loved the pakistani refrences teenage girl living her her family in new jersey super hero fan girl all so relatable ', ' one of the most overrated comic book movies out there so messed up ', ' this movie is not bad it just disappointing taskmaster wtf how could they do him so wrong plot please it too late for story in between civil war and it post credit scene come on we all know what happens with nat so why did you make this movie now the only thing did enjoy though were the new characters but other than that disappointing ', ' personally thought this series was really good the voice acting is excellent there are some actors who ve played the characters before like roger craig smith captain america and fred tatasciore hulk but you also get newcomers like patrick seitz notable as dio from jojo bizarre adventure as thor the story is also well written we follow three young children who were genetically modified by hydra growing up thinking they were the good guys and the avengers were evil before learning they were wrong and lied to all along it a well set up story with an enjoyable cast of original characters who work well with marvel comics characters overall like the characters lot too it used them all to their full potential even giving some love to lesser known or cared about characters at the time like hawkeye and kamala khan it also gives enjoyable stories with characters we do know and love like captain america solo search for traces leading to the winter soldier in russia d say if you can give this series watch it just fun series ', ' marvel does what marvel does well but that not to say all things need doing ', ' in short it runs way to long and isnt helped by the fact it is slow in my opinion this film would have done better as mini series 1 season 8 episodes ', ' liked it lot generally tend to make my own opinions on movies myself so all the bashing didn bother me plus ve been reading comics since was 1990 so ve been carol danvers fan for while is it the best marvel movie no the storyline idea was good even the change of influential comic character thought was good fit but even though the idea was good it seemed not too well the actors were all great which think really made the movie brie larson was the perfect choice for this role sam jackson was great also think the scrolls and the young girl stole the show though its not feminist or sjw movie it would ve be ok with me whether it was or wasn i think some may be upset that it not dont let differing or strong political views influence my taste in movies it just strong willed superhero movie that played by female lead and to be honest that all it needs to be ', ' pity people who stopped on the first half of season 1 because apart from that is one of the best shows ve ever watched if imdb ignored the reviews from season 1 it would be solid 9 ', ' umm 5 4 girl with no super powers not even scarlett great cgi can save this movie ', ' the first marvel team up movie and the last film in phase one of the marvel cinematic universe with almost every hero in this movie having their own film before this introducing them for the first time leading to big event with them all coming together to defeat big threat from returning well established villain after rewatching the movie can still say that the first avengers movie is still fantastic marvel film all these years later the team up movie the avengers 2012 has outstanding performances fun action likable characters great marvel villain well done cgi and visual effects and funny marvel humor am sure there are points in the plot or certain moments in the movie that you will notice as issues and did notice them too while watching the film but they did not bother me because was too invested in what was happening actors chris evans chris hemsworth and robert downey jr are once again great as the marvel heroes steve rogers captain america tony stark iron man and thor with them being at odds with each other at first on how to handle the loki situation but later knowing how to work together with connection to captain america on what he knows about the tesseract and thor trying to find his brother and knock sense into him the rest of the team includes natasha romanoff black widow bruce banner the hulk and clint barton hawkeye played very well by scarlett johansson mark ruffalo and jeremy renner natasha helping nick fury put the team together bruce helping find the tesseract location and though clint is mind controlled for most of the movie he snaps out of it and is cool when he joins the team lastly once the team comes together they have quite few good interactions with one another and they work well together when in battle also samuel jackson is great as nick fury by forming the team and be the base of operations when on the helicarrier being the director of the h e d organization the returning villain loki once again played fantastically by tom hiddleston with him making the character developed villain that you can both love and hate at the same time because of all the things he does in the movie that harms people messes with the avengers team or helps in his plan to rule over new york with the help of the chitauri army there was also an occasional interaction between him and thor where they talk about previous events from thor 2011 the action sequences are fun and there are well done cgi and visual effects used for iron man suits thor thunder lightning abilities when using his hammer mjolnir the flying helicarrier and when the chitauri is attacking the city the movie has effective and funny humor with the interactions between themselves and between them and loki were funny at times and cool to see the team up movie the avengers 2012 has well done performances fun action likable characters great marvel villain well done cgi and visual effects and funny marvel humor am sure there are points in the plot or certain moments in the movie that you will think are issues and they are noticeable when watching the film but they did not bother me because did had fun with it will just say that this is good conclusion for phase one of the mcu and phase one is great start for this ever expanding marvel cinematic universe this is worth watching and rewatching for regular fans or lifelong fans of marvel which is why this movie is highly recommended with it showing the fun and enjoyable early days of the marvel cinematic universe ', ' first season was amazing whole story of punisher done great second season is quite weak to be honest jon plays great it is just screenplay that is soo bad ', ' loved it this movie brings everything we ve all come to expect from the mcu the stan lee cameo was fun to see brie larson is complete badass and delivers an amazing performance as captain marvel go see this movie and then go see it again ', ' one of the worst marvel show have seen if marvel continues this kind of show linking religion to the marvel universe then marvel will surely lose viewers ', ' it was not enjoyable the plot is geargrindingly slow it paces like toddler on sugar high that crashes the main character is typical self absorbed gen teen seeking constant gratification she thoughtless and clueless ', ' jessica jones season 1 was super unique for the mcu such thrilling story with an oddly mean protagonist who you can still feel bad for because not everyone asks for the superhero life season 2 returns to the character after the defenders and think it fixed all my gripes about her before by letting her grow bunch it allows me to look at her first season as more of hero origin story we see lot more of jessica origin than in the first season and you really feel bad for her still this season was nowhere close to as strong as the first since think it impossible to compete with kilgrave as villain regardless who they choose to make the villain in season 2 is an interesting concept someone who jessica wants desperately not to kill but feels obligated to deal with brings out lot in her for an emotional and compelling conflict the story behind the conflict is clunky and kinda forgettable at times but it still creates good character arc for jessica as for the other characters never cared for the supporting cast too much before and that mostly remains the same malcolm is still just fine and kinda likable while trish is even more annoying than before the one character that stood out was hogarth who is still her selfish self but actually has really sad arc that allows her to change lot as for the action it still just decent but this is definitely not show that needs high budget fight scenes at its core the show is an espionage like investigation story about broken people in the otherwise colorful world of the mcu and season 2 continues to do that decently well ', ' probably the worst movie from marvel very slow pace and doesn do justice to any of the characters both new and old feels like random movie released by marvel just to keep the attention from the audience very disappointed ', ' save yourself and don start watching daredevil it will set your standards so high that you won be able to watch any other superhero series and gain satisfaction so let be more thorough in the first season the characters are introduced some are likable some are not but everyone is perfectly connected to the story and is there for reason there are no secondary characters or filler episodes the villain is not the classic dumb guy who wants to destroy the world because of reasons and the hero is not the classic untouchable indestructible dude who just beats everyone because he can plot twists happen more that often especially in the second season without however losing their value admit this series got to me because it plays with your emotions in frustrating but yet so mesmerizing way it never sacrifices its story or character in order to provide us with cheap visual effects like others do the only sure thing is that will keep watching it 10 10 ', ' when was around 9 charlie cox moved into an apartment near my dads resturant in ireland while working on something he couldn tell us about my dad recognised him from daredevil and they talked he told me and got really exited was huge marvel fan and loved the comics so drew him picture of daredevil and my dad gave it to him when he came into his resturant next he signed photograph from the show and wrote message on it according to my dad he was super cool nice and would definitely believe him m 14 now and still have the picture that he signed also great show would reccomend ', ' absolutely awful so boring black widow hanging from helicopter looked so hokey the red mist from the vials was the worst cgi have seen in the modern era totally pointless not funny not entertaining total train wreck and embarrassment for the marvel franchise ', ' really loved it was hooked from start to finish thrilling funny fun captivating and touching felt the pacing was good in fact didn want it to end one of the best from marvel can wait to see it again ', ' read that style wise it had scott pilgrim vs the world style which is true it leans into the comic visuals and it great at it so really do like the editing but the most important part is almost always the story for me for the story though it super cringy trash do even like 12 year old girls like this from the rating and critics it also seems like no the bracelet even looks like plastic trash why would the family do 180 and the dad dress as hulk even with face paint how did the mom suddenly have 2 hulk costumes she supposedly made by herself story wise nothing really fits together or feels real relateable ', ' dialogues doesn have any depth to it it feels forced artificial at many scenes it more ethnicity and bollywood fanservice in the last episode than superhero movie father daughterr moments made me sleep as ve seen it lot of times before and the flashback story about their origin were not convincing at all ', ' the avengers by marvel is yet another one of those movies that tries too hard there are parts which are boring and meaningless then there are parts which are full of so called action but actually is confusing and baffling all these movies are tied together but am left wondering what on earth is going on here the film gets by on the use of cgi but the storyline and the acting are less than gripping yet another lame marvel movie ', ' love joss whedon love some comic book movies men daredevil batman like quite few of the actors in this so why on earth did hate it so much for me the style was probably the worst thing some movies grab me and make me watch this didn from the outset it felt like high budget tv episode the look felt stark and unrealistic or actually too realistic probably it seems to have been filmed for 3d because even in 2d you you just get lots of weird camera angles and strange tone to it the story well just found it hard to pay attention for even the most shortest of times it just was people doing stuff but no sense of direction or story or building menace in fact the menace looked like stargate tv series villain or something from kids movie and the thing is with stargate love the characters but don with this film they give me no reason to love them so their actions are thus uninteresting it doesn surprise me seeing afterwards that joss whedon directed it and it shows he a good writer but doesn have lot of directing experience having said that what do know look at the numbers it made but for me couldn even watch it all the way through it was completely not captivating ', ' the series started little slow and admit was bored in some parts but the last episode was spectacular had so many reservations about liking jon bernthal as frank castle especially when saw him in daredevil bernthal was all right but my biggest issue was he didn look anything like frank castle from the comics read in the 70s and 80s the more got into this series the more realized that bernthal did such masterful job with his portrayal of frank castle he basically made the character his own injecting his own persona into the character and making something better than the original his version of the character has conscience has feelings and sense of doing good and he modernized to the current times like the characters introduced throughout the series holy wow mary elizabeth mastrantonio is in this remember her from the color of money amber rose revah as agent madani is great she is so sexy she could make any woman turn gay do feel that ben barnes as billy russo was little miscast he is gorgeous but mon he a skinny little twerp and he going against big frank castle no contest spoiler alert skip to end of spoilers line the final fight with billy russo was powerful and terrifying there was sense of satisfaction that russo got what he was due end of spoilers really enjoyed this series probably as much as daredevil would rank the marvel netflix character series in this order daredevil great but little slow at times the punisher m united states marine love this line luke cage luke is so fine put other series possibly here iron fist bleagh will re watch jessica jones wasn too keen on it on first watch might also watch the defenders sometime ', ' don get me wrong think the actors did great job iman vellani was spot on with her character and have read some of the comics of ms marvel she was born for the role but my review is not about the acting it is about the wrting it isn great no it is your typical teen who idolises hero and eventually becomes one herself and goes thrugh the stuggle of balance we ve all seen it before mcu wise vellani will now go on into the marvels aka captain marvel 2 am proud of her and she deserves it ms marvel on the other hand was feel good show many of the characters were likeable but when it came to the twist in episode 4 5 it was quite boring but unexpected the final post credit scene was weird thats all got won watch it again but fun while it lasted am getting quite sick of what the mcu comes up with now especially after doctor strange 2 ', ' worst of mcu weak storyline comic task master will suicide by seeing the cinematic supporting characters are haha funny end credit scene is lame no future for bw bye bye ', ' started watching because was told it need to be watched to understand the marvel universe m on episode 4 jessica cold attitude is not appealing to watch ll continue hopefully it gets better ', ' it was huge disappointment not at all what was expecting first of all the actors are horrible and their acting is just as bad the plot is weak and boring yeah it received very high ratings but check the ratings after the 3rd episode don see this show lasting through the first season clark gregg was the only thing that was good in this show his character was funny and the only thing that was worth watching chole bennet is hot but that about it her acting was terrible brett dalton character is trying to be the silent bada type but it not working for him terrible the plot was boring and our evil mastermind is joke absolutely nothing threatening about her and the main part in the plot about what was giving the powers is just plain dumb mean how many people watched this and in the middle of the show just shook your head in disappointment m sure lot really wanted to like this show since m fan of the marvel movies but this is bad may not even give it second chance by watching the 2nd episode it that bad ', ' the first 3 seasons are pretty great but it just went downhill after that seasons 5 7 are pretty much unwatchable fitzsimmons are the only reason suffered through it they re absolutely adorable and wonderful and otp ', ' after spider man no way home and hawkeye had to watch daredevil again and have to say despite the weaknesses of the 2nd season this was one of marvel better series hope there is revival on disney ', ' this show reads like child show it lacks the seriousness of marvel that always dangles on the grey it seems like disney produced marvel show for their cable channel as if we were watching jessie the indian background and the heavy cultural reference also steal from the show plus in family were the are always keeping an eye on the main character she is allowed to go anywhere she wants at anytime plus who taught her to fight 13 year old beating trained assassins just too stupid ', ' america this is really really good best streaming marvel production since falcon winter soldier it a very different kind of story but it just as good there are critiques that it panders to younger audience and surely marvel disney is thinking about generating an audience to replace us old duffers but these folks aren really paying attention to what going on and probably care less for stories about children anyway or perhaps that might recall that peter parker spider man is 16 the writing is exceptional the characters are really compelling it genuinely funny and there are moments such as with the depiction of religious life that it moved me to tears yes it tv and it fiction but get the sense the writers also really want to convey genuine and heartfelt understanding of variety of everyday muslim and south asian life in the s and that works too since it an origin story it has that thrill of discovery of the iron man and ant man films as you see kamala starting to manifest and learn to handle her powers literally couldn contain clap for her on my couch in the second episode when she pulls out dramatic save m giving it 7 stars and hope you ll give the show chance to prove that rating ', ' feel sad that this film wasn very good because wanted to like it but overall it only worth seeing it because it has few important moments pertaining to endgame ', ' seriously don know where all the hate comes from the movie is great go see it ', ' do we start with the bad acting which isn fair considering the lead is still young actress but the supporting cast is not good either the writing and direction is by far the worst ve seen from disney marvel ', ' went into this film not expecting much just wanted some mindless superhero nonsense and that is what got would go further and say some of the scenes and ideas were wonderfully silly the singing kingdom was hilarious and throughout the cgi was as you would expect superb overall don expect challenging entertainment from the mcu and the marvels delivered decently mind numbing but enjoyable distration brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani each delivered decent performance preferred vellani in the current film to her earlier tv series the carol worship made sense of the character my only niggle is that it might be the marvels sets up team of giggly school girl characters hope not ', ' iman vellani was endearing and has good comedic timing other than that have nothing positive to say about this movie kevin feige needs to retire marvel has lost its way what was fun and creative in thor ragnorak has devolved into fully jumping the shark also the characters were so poorly developed bree larson who has acted capably in other movies had about as much personality as plank of wood the dynamic between the women had just silly training montage in which to be developed the stupidity of the water planet and the cat monsters was just garbage suppose they were trying to appeal to young girls with fairytale fantasy of marrying handsome prince that the only explanation could come up with just lazy film making mostly terrible acting and disservice to the women who this film was supposedly meant to appeal to ', ' remember how felt after watching the first episode it was meh to describe it best think it was only out of sheer boredom continued to watch it especially didn like skye found her too intrusive and irritating for my liking but knew the show still had some potential the other characters entranced me sure the plot was bland and boring but knew it was only the first few episodes out of twenty two this meant there was room for development and by gum did that last episode delivered the things with new series are is that they require patience you have to be very picky if you expect an amazingly complicated plot right at the beginning slow start makes sense it matters on where the show takes us afterwards and we ve been to lot of places in aos it just took time to pull everything together for neat finish and m glad they took their time how else are we able to achieve such deep and rich relationship with all the characters find it really funny how some of the viewers are still bitching about how there were no major superheroes featured in the show well the show made it clear that it was gonna be about the agents and the strength of humanity who cares the mains don have any superpowers it made me admire them only more this show lacked nothing at the end but perhaps shall give it nine for the minor inconvenience of the first couple of episodes ', ' watched 1st episode full worst pilot episode watched 2nd episode with hope that it will improve but couldn even complete tried my best to watch it to keep up with the timeline but couldn worst marvel series my advice do not waste time on this ', ' well m big fan of the punisher since nineties grew up with his comics and was very excited when netflix announced the series but unfortunately was bored just after the first episode the character is not the doomed man who wear the white skull on the chest he just an haunted soldier with lot of flashback and poor action ability drama movie nothing else tip for netflix for the next season take look to the garth ennis characters that the punisher ', ' the action the humor and perfomances were all great had very very low expectations and the overall quality of the final product surprised me lot well done ', ' it almost perfect in every way that not an overstatement it breaking bad level good charlie cox actually became matt murdock he seamlessly plays blind man and an incredible vigilante with mind blowingly shocking heightened senses and wilson fisk is just too perfect and compelling as the kingpin soo much authority and control could not stop cheering for each of their characters as well john bernthal flawless and born to play portrayal of the punisher also really liked ben pointdexter his throwing was insane this show shows them in more than just the good and bad guy roles it does it brilliantly and with such careful balance of fickle human emotions ', ' after saw the trailer for the first time didn have high expectations for the movie had the same feeling that had when watching the transformer 3 trailer the first time after reading all the euphoric reviews on the internet decided to watch the movie tonight even saw it in 3d the movie was just as bad as the trailer looked the villain loki wasn interesting or threatening at all whatever happened to good villain the whole story was really really weak the whole story reminded me very much of transformer 3 and was just as bad don understand why so many people here praise this movie if this is supposedly the best super hero movie hollywood is able to make in 2012 good night don understand why it is so hard for hollywood to make great movie with really good dramatic epic story there are so many good comic book stories out there it can be that hard to just turn them into good movie was just as disappointed from this movie as was from transformers 3 definitely won watch this movie again at the movie theater or buy it on dvd hoolywood has become so boring it sad sick of all the cgi just want to finally watch good movie with good story ', ' this is the 3rd marvel series watched dont know what is their obsession with 13 episodes reducing few episodes can make it much more interesting its not much of the problem in the punisher season 1 but daredevil season 1 was too stretched that it could have ended well in 8 9 episodes at max moving on to punisher it starts with bang punisher has killed all the cartel and goons and then living all on his own as construction worker living in same ghost of past he gets followed by david lieberman who tells him that his family was killed because of what happened in kandahar and then starts his mission along with david lieberman to find the real culprit and avenge the death of his family the series moves on as mission from one link to other and than to the real man or the head what differentiate this from daredevil season 1 is that punisher maintains its pace except at few places there are twists and surprises that keeps one on their toes last 4 episodes are the best episodes they are fast things happen at great speed and makes one remain on the edge of the seat wasnt happy with one side track of lewis walcott but the way it ends was fab and made all my complains go away everyone has acted very well loved the background music and the loud music during the starting credits screenplay is good except that they would have made it shorter by an episode but its minor glitch jon bernthall act and the screenplay is so good that in the end when he beat and kill the villains felt big rush of adrenaline all the blood and gory shown looks justified such is the level of empathy that it feels like we got our revenge some of my favourite scenes scenes between frank and david kids david reaction when he finds frank almost dead madani and karen conversation madani and james marion conversation frank punisher killing the last 2 culprits lewis attack on karen and senator stan ori most of these are in last 4 episodes and it will be really criminal if exclude anything from those episodes as best moments its dark and probably little slow but the screenplay and the acts of jon bernth ebon and ben barnes makes it thrilling and an exciting ride with good twists and turns which give good adrenaline rush would rate it 9 10 waiting for season 2 ', ' have watched the first few episodes of this on netflix and must say am not impressed at all unlike daredevil which really liked jessica jones does not offer sufficient back story to make newbies to the series become fully acquainted with the character find this pretty typical of marvel however as their shows and movies rely on the audience too much to know their stuff unlike dc who are happy to help the newbies come new fans like with arrow and the flash initially liked the idea behind the pi aspect but then the superpowers got in the way and then it because one prolonged sex fest with the luke cage character although so far have not seen much of the cage character he seems like character would like to see more of but he also seems bit of rip off on wolverine without the wolf element am not even feeling the david tennent character kilgrave either and am big fan of david too perhaps the pace of this show is little too slow for my liking so gonna give the rest miss ', ' had great time good script good acting good direction what do you expect ', ' in general when you look there is only one thought and this is exactly marvel so much marvel is associated with the sterile heroes 24 7 under the elixir of immortality so netflix here is annealed so that the series and next is not worth it with movies and games for in the films everything was limited to rather meager postrelushkami with the mafia and in the game there was not even plot just stupid meat and nothing else here the creators managed to combine rather bloody exchange of fire with twisted plot which ultimately completely changed the original lore in general mean the fact that the original hero of the creators was positioned as fighter against crime with gun although in fact of course it is dashing substitution of concepts for it all about revenge here they went further because criminals are no longer stereotyped we also touched upon some unpleasant topics overseas unpleasant that as rule are not displayed in the cinema such as how much influence and connections are resolved and also sometimes oil is found instead of wmd and this happens yes but they touched upon something but they didn manage to reveal to the full extent as for example it was in the armory baron or generation of assassins by cons the main disadvantage is that the story begins almost from the middle as result the third party viewer who came from the side and did not look at those same two episodes from the second season of daredevil will not understand at all what the hell is happening here and the blame is that at one time netflix decided to raise the rating of the second season of daredevil by suddenly adding the punisher there for couple of episodes not the worst solution but it was damn weird for simply looking at how negative the stick is made from the series into the series is simply because think he is simply too lazy to bludgeon the same villains hundred times with bludgeon waiting forever for those not to mind it clear that in such universe frank castle will look very strange as result when it came to creating full fledged story about the punisher it was decided to leave the string in the middle of the second season of daredevils and this is no less strange decision repeat in daredevil there is different morality different attitude towards murder there is taboo and accordingly it seems to me that there is different audience and the punisher fans would hardly think to look for string in another series almost unrelated on the other hand of course the plot about the mafia is already pretty beaten after all two whole films were shot purely about the war with the mafia so it good that the creators decided not to loop at that but it is possible that the creators decided to spend less time on the war with the mafia and the cartels and had the effect that sometimes there were rather long strange interruptions such as with the wife of lieberman or with the wife of castle in scenes with torture on the whole it is clear that the final was just put off as best they could in the end even the outcome was somewhat prolonged in general the series was very good but not perfect at the same time the punisher turned into kind of mad berserker thanks to which the action for the most part was just bang ', ' this is very good movie but 8 8 stars good not even close and the main reason is the story which isn that compelling rather it pretty standard superhero has to save the world from an evil force the storyline has few surprises and is predictable what brings this movie up to 7 stars on my meter is the execution of it the dialogs the acting the jokes and particularly the special effects it just outstanding what is not so outstanding is that scarlett johansen and other non super heroes are hiding behind yellow cabs with tiny guns their enemy monstrous godzilla like flying snake creatures that can knock over the empire state building in matter of seconds and which throws cars 100s of feet in the air and which couldn care less about bullets these non super heroes magically survive and even contribute significantly to beat the monsters from outer space without any injury whatsoever it kind of disappointing that so many reviewers so far are so emotional about this movie it kind of reminds me about dark knight another very good but way overrated movie who can honestly say that this movie is even in the same category as shawshank godfather and goodfellas and such the story simply isn there there nothing memorable about this movie or dark knight for that matter wouldn see it again ', ' liked season one season two not so much think it was in episode 10 or 11 that fonzie jumped the shark tank don know which story arc was worse elektra or punisher ', ' you can see the sudden and dramatic shift from creating quality show in season one to using the show to push leftist narrative in season two amd the show seriously suffers from it while the over the top violence and action is still really good the woke feminist influence in season 2 really hurt the writing quality they seemed more concerned with making the russians the alt right and christian fundamentalists the bad guys even though then with crafting story that actually made sense ', ' such waste of time my god who is watching those shows typical current woke sholw by disney godawful in its script acting and plot don waste your time ', ' this movie is pure garbage scarlet is really bad actress you can take this movie and leave only the battle scene and delete the other and it will be ok you have the same argument that transformers movie cube with powers to control the universe two sides fighting the good and the evil the good wins no surprises prefer watchmen capitan america is really weak super hero boring boring boring felt asleep all the first hour of the movie want my money back also the aliens soldiers are not so good iron man was ok nick fury regular the air battleship was useless really did not understand why they don sent that huge battleship to fight the aliens ', ' think people are hating on the show for no reason it an origin show for teenage superhero it going to be about her life problems teenagers face south asian culture here is on point the music is on point ', ' joss whedon is genius the ability to bring this cast and these characters together and actually make pretty phenomenal movie is tremendous accomplishment but even more than that he was able to finally make the hulk true to his comic book character e funny and bad ass he even made dull captain america and thor entertaining but the true star of the film has to be robert downey jr without his comic relief in the first 2 3 of this film this movie would have bombed miserably understand the importance of character development but it tony stark downey who steals the show and makes the film bearable kudos to scarlett johansson her role as black widow was really thing of beauty strong female roles are hard to find in hollywood much less play with true abandonment however johansson shines on the screen as the kick ass siren with any good action adventure an evil antagonist equally as wicked as his counterparts are good must be pertinent to the film plot to be successful film in this case tom hiddleston reprises his role as loki thor evil half brother as cements his role as screen villain extraordinaire however the crowning part of the whole film has to be the film final 30 minutes the ending battle of good vs evil is fantastic the many one liners come fast and furiously and the action sequences are out of this world literally at cost of 220 million to make you can definitely see it up on the screen am sure with salaries percentage payoff to the actors and director josh whedon that it will be very long time before paramount sees any profits to this film moreover gathering all these stars again for sequel is also highly unlikely so enjoy this very entertaining bit of nostalgia while you can highly recommend seeing this film would even suggest paying the additional cost to see it in imax am sure the ending battle sequence will be more that worth the cost of admission the summer has started off with bang let hope the momentum continues see more of my reviews the faris reel on facebook ', ' the marvels is so poorly conceived and ineptly executed that it not only makes this front runner for the dubious honor of worst movie of the mcu but contender for the worst superhero movie of all time giving catwoman run for its money the big things aren the only aspects where the marvels fails there minimal chemistry among the three leads the allegedly serious sentimental moments are mawkish and cringe worthy the acting is generally subpar including that from brie larson an excellent actress except when she puts on her superhero cape the lone exception to this is iman vellani who brings puppy dog sincerity to her performance the fight scenes and special effects laden sequences are so badly choreographed and edited that it can be difficult to figure out what going on and if you want excitement look elsewhere in the past couple of years the mcu has been spinning its wheels with each new entry excepting guardians of the galaxy vol 3 as creative failure after creative failure has intensified the tailspin sadly the marvels is the worst of these offenders elevating the third ant man movie to masterpiece level by comparison instead of offering engaging storytelling it give us flashes bangs bad dialogue and mountain of fakery reminder that things that work in comic books don always translate to the silver screen it sound and fury signifying nothing except to expose another chink in the once impervious armor of the mcu ', ' don get the hate thought it was lot of fun the comedy was on point they made carol way more charismatic kamala is such treat so relatable and the cats stole the show my only two critiques were the villain thought she lack personality and was bit forgettable also there were some situations that requiered better explanation to understand the story better truly believe the hate comes from people that dislike the actresses and are not willing to have an open mind and let themselves enjoy the movie can wait to see more of kamala in future movies not the show though ', ' have got say loved this movie thought it was awesome so much so will go and watch it again soon especially to pick up on the cool 90 references again dropped in through out the movie also to pick up the bits that help answer alot of the questions over the mcu will be honest and say it does take short while to get going but with any new character it was never gonna come out of the traps guns blazin as you need to grow new character or they will seem too one dimensional and captain marvel is anything but one dimensional brie larson is fantastic in this as is samuel jackson and so is ben mendelsohn the humor is fantastic too this movie just grows and grows and grows leaving you wanting more and more and more job done there then really as cant wait to see more of captain marvel character in the future oh and also the 2 end credit scenes alone are worth the visit to the cinema only dont leave early fantastic movie addition to the mcu ', ' for those of us who watched and liked poi and then wondered what poi would have looked like if they didn have no killing policy the punisher would be close fit that being said there more than enough originality in this series so don worry the opening premise is similar but that where the similarities end the series does good job of bringing humanity to character that is usually portrayed to be cold and ruthless the action scenes are visceral and gory enough to keep most of us entertained and the twists do keep you on your toes all in all good watch ', ' as huge fan of marvel m little biased because pretty much like everything they put out my bias aside daredevil is terrific it actually my favorite marvel show along with the punisher if you don believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings even the critics loved this charlie cox and vincent onofrio were born to play daredevil and kingpin they re easily the best part of the show this is show that you ll want to binge as quickly as you can it that good it too bad that netflix couldn renew their contracts with marvel and they had to stop making the netflix marvel shows because every single one of them was great now that they re on disney they can bring these wonderful characters back they already started to with daredevil and kingpin showing up in other shows and they just renewed daredevil for another season now they have to do the same for the punisher luke cage and jessica jones at least bring them back into the mcu somehow if you re marvel fan then this is must watch ', ' ve been watching couple of superheroes tv series but this mannn usually m not write review for tv series but for this god it a really good one m just gonna tell you about the last season okay the way they build the story was brilliant they gave you an piece by piece of the background stories while they still doing main one and let me tell you my friend it not an easy job to keep that phase all characters was doing an amazing job maybe except the ambulance scene mahoney seems pretty funny for me hhehe kinda like how their changes frank characters little bit but it make us seeing him in really fresh performance and everything about that last episode one word epic ', ' want to try to keep this brief because feel there is need for three separate reviews for this movie so without further ado kids you ll love it now leave the room and let me talk to the adults next comic book geeks why am even sharing this with you you saw the movie over half year before did but then what if you were like me and wanted the hype to die down first or your expectations were feeling little strained well in case you haven seen this movie the avengers dances provocatively between two different marvel universe molds namely 616 and the ultimate universe no reason just because somebody said sam jackson could totally be the black nick fury in all without having everybody dressed as they should be in their original respective battle uniforms everybody pretty much is as they should be but the three characters you re going to appreciate the most are iron man thor and hulk banner they re just so much better portrayed and their parts are so much more intriguing than fury black widow and hawkeye who in recent years has actually been one of the more interesting characters no matter what universe we re talking you will get to see your favourite characters kick ass and interact the way they most likely would and there are hell of lot of in jokes and references to appreciate now please leave the room okay movie fans and fellow snobs if you re anything like me too much noise and activity makes you sleepy rather than lively especially when they try to make superheroes act and fight as humanly realistically as possible before just deciding aaah feck it and turning them into mortal kombat character animations in fact you know what feck it pros 1 joss whedon directed marvellously and gave us his best 2 character interplay is at many times very fun to watch 3 the film does not rush from scene to scene like phantom menace trying to pretend right in front of your eyes that it is not in fact happening 4 the backing cast is superb 5 there is hell of lot of bang for your buck and it is mostly excellently executed cons 1 hawkeye fury and black widow seem largely useless 2 you can tell the actors know it 3 captain america comes across as bloody weakling and spends more time doing acrobatics and being depressed than he does take charge and kick ass 4 the population of new york city are mindless sheep with no presence heart or meaning and therefore have no reason for us to care that the avengers are rescuing them from an alien invasion 5 the alien invaders didn have enough time to prove how big threat they really were before avengers started stomping them wholesale this kind of defeats the object of them being threat this film however has the potential and know that joss whedon is perfectionist that will improve with every sequel look forward to the next film s mark ruffalo best actor and best portrayal of banner there has ever been ', ' you only have six episodes in total the plot is so slow most of the time we look at national culture not hero show villains are not attractive the plot is messed up right now and don know how to get better in the remaining two episodes ', ' they wanted the fun reckless spy character of archer but wanted to mix in some virtue signals if you shoot for both laughter and clapter you end up with neither do one or the other ', ' thought to give it try to watch this series though my conscious is saying not to yet thought to give it try and realised got lot of patience yet was loosing it mean who are these writers and with what sence they wrote this story and how this was aproved by disney keeping in mind it part of mcu have seen many disney movies but this series wow would never recomend this to even my enemies to watch pathetic writing low quality direction low cgi not even kids enjoy this series am still wondering how this series got 6 rating while was looking at the rating cart found that many has given 10 stars to this series mean might they are high while giving the ratings or it is paid ', ' fantastic addition to the mcu catchy engaging very different aesthetic which makes it enjoyable not cookie cutter experience and really appreciate this character don understand the haters ', ' as you all know past 2 series were not so good in terms of action some marvel spices ', ' all of this behind the scenes are the reason why wandavision will win so many emmys including elizabeth olsen and kathryn hahn watching this team work in terms of direction screenwriting musical composition visual effects and acting is completely extraordinary it a brilliant trip behind the scenes and hope that all mcu mini series that follow this one would be on the same level as wandavision ', ' first let me talk about basics all super hero movies created by marvel and dc are alike in many respects they are all well made with lot of action good actors great special effects and mostly good stories but the big differences between marvel from dc is humor marvel movies are funny and they are not just full of simple gags they have good and very original comedy just think of guardians of the galaxy those two were funny from the beginning to the end and all their characters were memorable likable well connected with one another dc only two attempts at making their movies funny were suicide squad and birds of prey both failed miserably they were fully of gags that were not at all funny their were like an amateur comedian act you know where the guy is standing on stage in front of the big audience sweating profusely telling jokes and laughing at them while everyone else yawns there was whole slew of things wrong with black widow the story was weak and am being kind here well maybe the original comic was good but the execution of that comic was anything but good the action in some places was simply ridiculous can see captain america or vision jump off the tall building and land safely but when non enhanced person like black widow falls for ten storey height and hits every metal object on her way down and then rises with itty bitty scratch on her hand that makes you share your head there were moments when thought optimus prime would form himself from the falling rubble and say something heroic in his poorly disguised irish accent even 007 movies try to make their action somewhat realistic david harbour was the only bright spot in this movie he was really good and its mostly because of him rated this movie with 3 stars side note it nice to see him in comedic roles he managed to make another bad movie hellboy watchable unfortunately david harbour couldn save black widow it was just not enough until saw this movie thought the weakest one in the whole marvel movie universe was captain marvel but now believe black widow has taken its place it really sad you know this strange lack of good writing makes me wonder if they could make loki wonderful tv series why couldn they do better job with black widow oh one more thing to quote one of deadpool jokes couldn the studio come up with at least one famous mutant not single character from the avengers universe mean main character general ross doesn count made cameo in black widow ', ' am surprised why people are downgrading this movie had personally limited expectation from it because she is already dead was only trying to find what actually happened in budap st it is good that the movie tried made us focus more on yelena and of course she is more to look on future mcu development that why the movie succeeded on its purpose ', ' all the jokes and gags fell flat the accents were painfully bad the story and the acting was standard this film isn worth sitting for over two hours boring ', ' low level story writing fails to entertain the origin of her power is biggest joke starts loosing grip initially marvel has made viewers sad for this ', ' lot happens in the first 15 minutes plenty of action and story telling but it really tapers off on both as the movie slowly moves forward from there the real star of the movie was yelena it was worth the watch just for florence pugh hang on after the credits roll as always there a small cameo it has me looking forward to another branch off ', ' it was great movie and while it wasn as focused on scarlett johanson as thought it was going to be it is still an awesome movie ', ' marvel the avengers is the cross over movie that everyone was waiting for all our favorite heroes iron man captain america the hulk thor black widow and hawkeye are in one movie in order to stop the evil loki and it is perhaps one of the most critically loved and successful movies and with good reason the movie is incredibly amazing for starters the acting everything actor did phenomenal job as their characters each actor robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo etc defined their characters so was the villain loki was completely evil and awesome the dialogue should also be addressed the dialogue was beautifully written for the characters and it seemed believable because they really weren friends that would be spoiler but we all knew that would happen the action was the best ve seen in 2012 it was all shot well the one shot in the last two trailers was the best scene in the movie with the hulk smashing thor using that cool hammer merica throwing his mighty shield it was christmas for moviegoers in the end what else is there to say that everyone else hasn the avengers is cinematic gold at its finest it was exciting it was humorous and it was just what 2012 needed for the summer movie season this is feeling we don get in movies these days four years of buildup paid for us in marvel crowning achievement marvel the avengers ', ' this movie is trying to be kids movie while also trying to appeal to the older fans but kinda fails to do so yes this movie is not the greatest but honestly liked it marvel is clearly trying to appeal to larger audience including children was not fan of the captain marvel movie and if this movie didn have ms marvel would hate it even more than captain marvel she is just such an interesting character captain marvel meh yes she got cool powers but not so good story imo walked out of this movie liking it it might not have the greatest of story but it is fun to watch liked how goofy some scenes were but many scenes felt off too captain marvel and her story needs lot of work honestly and monica rambeau felt unnecessary in the story also the whole concept was super fun and interesting and could definitionally be implemented lot better so basically captain marvel doesn have good story monica is unnecessary and ms marvel is great and the cats are great too this movie would be really boring without ms marvel ', ' all the build up from iron man 1 2 hulk thor and capt america paid off in huge way with this one all the character and story development already happened across those movies now they just had to bring them all together and it was easy how all the characters meshed was great the action exactly what you want for popcorn summer flick it tough to put it in the overall top 5 because think some of the other mcu movies have better stories but this one is right up there ', ' marvel what pathetic time after of your viewers ', ' am following the mcu since it inception and m updating myself by watching all it content ms marvel is one such series that watched for the sake of not missing the continuity of mcu the first episode was sigh of relief because the mix of 2d animation with live action was new the story worked well for pilot episode and there was no teenage cringe looking at you riverdale but once the story moves into the superhero part the story gets split into multiple branches that in the end you are not interested in any of them there is no suspense or hook factor to look out for the family sentiment did not work at all there is no character that had an actual character arc even the titular character ms marvel herself villain arc felt unnecessary and diluted the story the only suspense factor also had mediocre reveal am happy that some muslim friends of mine gave feedback that they got the representation right and it did not hurt their feelings cinematography and colour grading was good and song selections were ok but they went too overboard with the background vocals in the last 2 episodes and it was unbearable d suggest this for very strict marvel fans who are hellbent on seeing the storyline of ms marvel character visually otherwise do read the episode information in wikipedia and don watch this ', ' the first worst series by marvel note this in few days dc will take over marvel dear marvel please increase the quality in upcoming series and movies fyi am fan of marvel so you can understand that really didn liked this series ', ' think the voice acting for this show is pretty ok but overall the plot and characters are terrible no notable actions are ever taken to develop these lifeless characters also during the show we hear ton of background music which at times seems out of place the music itself is not bad but is terribly implemented its like the producers were trying to shoehorn full soundtrack into few episodes because of this the music starts and stops at weird times overall this show is terrible spent the last twenty minutes silently cringing to anyone who is thinking of watching this show or is planning to have their kids watch this show recommend you just don there are plenty of better shows out there to watch ', ' if you love the action you ve come to the origin of action ', ' not much else to say very cheesy acting from khan family and the stories feels bleh it very hard to get behind the story as didn enjoy the origin of her powers and feels just put out there if im being nit picky some of the dialogues from khan family were unrealistic and cringeworthy at times definitely targetted at the below 15 year olds for sure not my cup of tea but it may be for others hence m not going to bash this series but it does feel massive downgrade from loki and moonknight ', ' avengers is the good movie ever saw in other hollywood movies marvel done big job and give hard work and effort to make this avengers era cinimotogaraphy music and screenplay are very super mind blowing music for the action scences the characters of this movie defenetly lived the charater rolls ', ' they just took random movie clips some out of context to try and show the rise of characters your better off just watching the movies where everything is in context and makes lot more sense ', ' watching the one with the blind lawyer and the other one with the guy who works in the bar and has sex with jessica and then jessica it hard to think anything but these were the only characters left for the studio to buy and not one of them has enough of anything to have their own show think they do stuff but m not sure exactly what also david tennant ruins everything and finally just saying blind lawyer superhero makes me laugh krysten deserves better ', ' really enjoyed the film for me it was one of the stronger single hero stories m one of those people who just enjoys things so upon first viewing the legitimate issues some might have didn effect my enjoyment liked how the movie unfolded throughout its run time and its message was really good to see also samuel jackson love for the cat was amazing to see m already crying about endgame ', ' so many plot twists that makes you go crazy it watching never ending avengers ', ' so if your wanting an awesome movie for the summer this is so far the number one to go see it starts off with bang and doesn ever leave you wanting much more even if you have never seen any of the solo avenger superhero films in the past 2 years movies it doesn matter starts off with awesome plot and builds the entire time until the climax of the film happens and you will not even know when it going to start or finish if you like the other super hero movies this one will not let you down unless of course you see it after you watch the only other movie worth seeing this summer the dark knight rises only seen teasers for it but know it will be the number one movie because easily topping it predecessor the dark knight suggest only two movies to watch in theaters this summer are the avengers and the dark knight rises mr nolan will absolutely kill the competition with the best batman movies to date except jack nickolson as the joker strong 8 out of 10 just because it a must see film this summer only film have ever given 10 out of 10 is true romance because it gives you exactly what you want from film in every way you could think of ', ' actually just finished watching the first season ans being fan of daredevil and collecting the comics when was kid this version is as close to the comics have seen in the marvel comics movies and series that has been made its gritty like the comics were it portrays dd the way he is in the comics not such nice guy all in all would rank this 9 out of 10 get the feeling will be watching this season multiple times ans can wait to get more would highly recommend this series to anybody who wants to see how comic book should be portrayed in movie or series my hats off to everybody involved with this show absolutely fantastic ', ' after 4 years and 5 films the heroes of the marvel cinematic universe finally converged as phase one closed out with the much anticipated release of marvel the avengers starting with iron man 2008 and steadily releasing enjoyable and relatable films fans were eager to enjoy the first major crossover fresh from successful television career and before his controversies director joss whedon was brought in to write and direct this historic team up seeking revenge after the events of thor 2011 loki tom hiddleston steals the tesseract from h e d nick fury samuel jackson set on acquiring throne of his own loki partners with mysterious benefactor to acquire chitauri alien army with no other option fury assembles earth mightiest heroes to defend their country working together for the first time personalities clash and egos may get in the way before these seven superheroes can save anyone opening by showcasing loki dastardly plan hiddleston performance cements itself as one of the best in the saga while hawkeye jeremy renner spends most of the film mind controlled underutilized his action sequences are quite fun and the banter between himself and black widow scarlett johansson proves to be an enjoyable introduction to their relationship bruce banner mark ruffalo is better handled than he was in the incredible hulk 2008 giving more of balance to his characters monstrous rage and yearning for loneliness while excelling at exploring both sides the trio of iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans and thor chris hemsworth are the icing on the already loaded cake as their performances bring the film to much higher level marvel studios could not have been luckier when casting the original avengers and it is shown in every moment of this film though an ensemble film of this caliber could easily have felt bloated and messy the avengers thrives by utilizing its previously established heroes and expanding upon their universe each member adds unique attributes and characteristics which create thrilling interactions that keep the audience clamoring for more having an obsession with comic books and superheroes my entire life this film was dream come true while there were other great superhero films before this the avengers did what no other film had before by putting all the greatest heroes together just as they were in the comic books that made them famous ', ' wow didn love the first movie captain marvel and this one just left haze in my brain while enjoyed the ms marvel tv series this movie just left me flat dull and slow with far too many silly scenes what the hell is flerkin and having them invade to song from cats is that the screenplay writers idea of humor in ww2 when the japanese swept through the pacific they suffered from something later called victory disease marvel under disney is suffering the same thing where they once made entertaining films now they push out drek like this and wonder why these movies bomb go back and examine phase 1 and 2 want to see good movies these are this is just wast of celluloid not even samuel jackson breathed any life into this ', ' marvel perfect balance between storyline and action don agree that it is just typical marvel movie it has string female cast who kicked some serious am hollywood action blockbuster freak and black widow was worth the 29 for premier access on disney plus ', ' have to admit that was in no particular hurry to get to sit down and watch the 2023 movie the marvels as have steadily grown weary of the marvel movies sure the marvel movies makes for fair enough entertainment given their effects and such but there are just too many of them and they sort of seem like dime dozen the storyline in the marvels was bit cluttered and somewhat of struggle to really grasp and understand what writers nia dacosta megan mcdonnell and elissa karasik really were trying to convey here with the script and storyline sure it was watchable but it was mostly because of the constant non stop action and the special effects and there was bit too much comedy throughout the course of the movie which made the movie feel unnecessary goofy the villain in the movie dar benn played by zawe ashton felt like rather irrelevant and pointless antagonist as she seemed to have very little motivation or cause for her villainous acts was there something to her storyline prior to what transpired in the marvels that would have done the character more justice the acting performances in the marvels was good and leading actresses brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani certainly carried the movie quite nicely have to mention the song and dance scene in the marvels because it was especially rough and horrible to sit through it felt so out of place and out of tune with the entire overall feel of the movie it is so cringeworthy that it has to be seen in order to be believed how toe curling bad it was there was lot of action in the marvels and mean lot it was almost non stop action fest from start to end and while it definitely was an upscaled speed that the movie went forward in it was somewhat on the cost of profound and compelling storyline the action were overshadowing the narrative in the movie truth be told visually then the marvels is good of course it is as it is marvel studios movie and that is something that holds true for all of the marvel movies the cgi effects are quite amazing and let just be honest it is the effects that serve as the deal sweetener when you sit down to watch these copy paste movies my rating of the marvels from director nia dacosta lands on five out of ten stars ', ' after all the hype was expecting an entertaining movie to me that means plot and story line that can feel part of and be interested in what happens to the characters pretty much became bored due to feeling no connection with the characters and nothing unexpected happening sure there are special effects and bunch of stuff thrown in just to see if it would stick to the wall but none of it engaging then there were characters that were so shallow that felt no interest in who they were or what part they played did gwineth paltrow actually get paid for whatever it is she was doing the hulk seemed to be more of an after thought in this story as there was no consistency in his role in the hulk first scene he an uncontrollable force that destroys anything regardless of whether it involved resources that belonged to good or evil the climax of the movie which involves an alien invasion was far from exciting due to minimal effort being made to compel the viewer into wondering oh my whats going to happen now instead the feeling evoked was gee that was an ok special effect ', ' the movie has wafer thin plot and still extends its running time over 2 hours the movie can help with crisper editing one time watch if you are marvel fan ', ' this movie has so much going on but amidst all that going on it never manages to deliver on earning neither its highs or lows iman vellani once again shines through the mediocre material she given and can only imagine what she could do in competent production the marvels has the same telltale raw signs of too little time spent cooking that has plagued recent mcu efforts and while far from the lows of secret invasion or love and thunder there is little reason to pay money to see this latest outing in the now faded mcu the movie is plagued by poor writing bad choreography and director utterly unsuited for the job at hand besides two fun end credit scenes there is little worth your time here ', ' honestly everything is unlikeable about this movie expected too much from this but it didnt crossed half of my expectations how can you waste character like taskmaster probably the worst movie villain ever the story was ok but its all over the place personally couldnt connect to the movie im giving 5 stars for casts performance and vfx but nothing special in this movie ', ' the writing the plot and the cast is spot on this fits in the mu perfectly ', ' mcu first female led superhero film is fun blockbuster that breezes through its two hour five minute run time though not in any kind of spectacular fashion the film tells non linear origin story as it slowly pieces together carol danver forgotten past which is refreshing way to tell an origin story in its own right but it is told with little to no emotional depth at all the closest to emotion is danver friendship with lashana lynch maria rambeau and her aunt like relationship with rambeau daughter monica akira akbar but these moments with them are few and far between there are some outstanding characters though who helped bring marvel dependable brand of humor to this film ben mendohlson is standout as the kree warrior talos offering an intimidating yet as we get to know his character more amusing presence samuel jackson as he always has shone as younger nick fury being introduced to aliens for the first time and of course goose the cat stole every scene he was in captain marvel overall doesn offer anything new and spectacular but behind the mcu brand of humor refreshingly told origin story and some exciting action sequences albeit at times dark and choppy this is solid film just don expect too much from it ', ' am expecting much more in this series and expecting it to grow on me the cultural and religion references are not targeted to everyone but think its good start and will grow on its audience kudos to marvel to be more inclusive ', ' this pandering annoying useless mess of show it tries to be relatable with things like tiktok and instagram but it just seems like it just going through list of trendy things kids are into worst thing marvel has ever made ', ' marvel have hit rock bottom with this piece of drivel what mess how quality control mr feige can turn out excellent content like guardians of the galaxy 3 the hawkeye series and werewolf by night then allow content like the marvels and she hulk to be released is beyond me hopefully the soon to be released deadpool 3 will set the marvel ship afloat again the only thing worth watching this for is the end credits scene no spoilers here though even the stalwart samuel jackson nick fury couldn save the movie his character used mainly for comic relief which is comic book sin ', ' found after each scene there needed to be something interactive to do and if you were to glue lots of video game cinematics together you would get something quite similar to this movie e you would have no flow found the storyline quite shallow the character introductions unnecessary and the whole experience was rather disjointed to me also hate movies where need to adjust the volume throughout the movie unlike the dark knight for example which probably has one of the tightest mixes for an action movie this one was all over the place quiet dialogue and extremely loud action sequences the music was suitably dramatic but not especially memorable comparing it to similar movies would rate the avengers little better than the fantastic four but nowhere near as good as the men movies ', ' the show is obviously targeting teenage audience so my teenage daughters opted to try it out stuck around in the background they made it ten minutes the show sucks the writing sucks and deserpstely attempts to relate to kids the character sucks easily on the of crappiest marvel characters it just doesn work this isn our cup of tea similar to how star wars has gone kenobi sucks and it breaks my heart to say that you ve got no talent left you re scrapping the bottom you have lost your creative edge ', ' in joss whedon the avengers three marvel comics superheroes iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans and the hulk mark ruffalo are recruited by h e d to do battle against loki tom hiddleston the brother of thor chris hemsworth who has come to earth with an alien army to claim the world for his own but can three such distinctly talented yet strong willed individuals put aside their differences and egos long enough to function as team as the avengers to save the planet there no question that gathering three classic superheroes into single film was stroke of marketing genius as well as considerable treat for fans the movie itself is lively loud and epic in scale with just enough character delineation to keep us engaged on human level plus it culminates in spectacular jamboree of destruction in new york city that turns into veritable valhalla for cgi aficionados all the above mentioned actors enter into the spirit of the enterprise as do scarlett johansson jeremy renner clark gregg samuel jackson gwyneth paltrow powers boothe jenny agutter and harry dean stanton as the pure humans in the cast good fun ', ' definitely the hottest series have seen lately it went over my expectations and blew my mind up magnificent work in every part of the movie making wasn so sure about it because of the super heroism but the whole series is so grounded the series has everything it doesn let you take breath the cast is giving breathtaking performances and maybe at some point you even get to love kingpin two days were enough to clear it i totally recommend this to everyone even to the don like the super heroes people just watch it and let it amaze you cheers ', ' they needed to read about religion before writting story about it it kinda like mix between hindsu and islam and christian because this isn islam and for the acting they picked the right people for it but its kid show more like disney cartoon show not marvel show ', ' daredevil was such an incredible show certainly marvel greatest failure was cancelling this masterpiece if dc has the dark knight trilogy well marvel has daredevil daredevil is one of the best shows ve ever seen the story the fight scenes and the characters are top notch charlie cox daredevil and vincent onofrio wilson fisk led such an amazing cast who were all at the top of their game throughout the entire series the directing and cinematography are great there really not much more to say that hasn already been said about this amazing show so just do yourself favor and go watch it ', ' it a coming of age story for younger teens it exactly what marvel needs have been fan of comics and mcu for my entire life this is great because can watch this series with my daughter something could not do before it a great balance of teen angst wit and the struggles of life if anyone says it awful they don get it go in to have good time and you will ', ' am truly baffled by the negative reviews this show is incredible every character is truly fascinating and we get glimpses of their back stories to supplement the story but guess people are disappointed that not everything was revealed immediately am almost positive that the mystery of jessica jones background is intentional and they will reveal more as the show develops as for people that complain that the show is boring these must be the people keeping things like the transformers series in business if you re looking for constant explosions and action you ll be disappointed however if you are looking for show with well developed characters chilling villain compelling and relatable main character an intriguing storyline and just utterly spectacular acting this is the show for you no it not typical superhero show it goes above and beyond in so many aspects this has raised the bar for superhero stories in my opinion krysten ritter is superb and very believable as jessica jones love love love this show give it chance you will not be sorry you did can wait for season 2 ', ' love it the storyline was absolutely amazing jon bernthal was great as the punisher can wait for season 3 fricking loved it love you jon bernthal you are the greatest actor have ever seen ', ' this film in essence is fan boy film and hits all the spots you could ve asked for as marvel fan most the negative reviews ve seen of this film pull on aspects like too cgi dependent and compare it to films like dark knight or watchmen although films like watchmen and dark knight are superhero flicks like avengers it a very different ball park avengers is fun ride with enjoyable characters great villain good action and it manages to do what no film of its time was able to successfully pull multiple main characters into shared story which doesn feel like overkill the cgi element wasn that big of problem for me either do love practical effects and they trump cgi for me most of the time but when you ve got such heavy sci fi story like this one you can dream of using practical it would be way too expensive and would take something away from the film for me if you ve never seen avengers and you love action comedy and colourful costumes urge you to check this out ', ' iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor captain america the first avenger the avengers is the ultimate culmination of all those movies which ranged in quality from slightly above average to excellent in my review of the first iron man called it the pinnacle of marvel cinema it has now been topped the story goes that after captain america the tesseract ended up at the bottom of the ocean and nick fury samuel jackson and h e d pulled it out now loki tom hiddleston wants it due to its inherently unlimited power which will give him the ability to rule with an iron fist over all of earth unless the avengers can get past their differences and stop him have recently come to the opinion that director and screenplay heavily influence acting this may be bit late to realize this but whatever it certainly seems to be true in this case joss whedon is apparently great fun to work with and his writing talent is well known both of these might be reasons why each actor performs better in this movie than in previous marvel films the highlights are chris evans robert downey jr and mark ruffalo each playing characters with hidden emotional depth that boils to the surface in the most commendable of ways especially the latter actor for obvious reasons though this trio leads the pack said pack is composed entirely of very strong performances something not usually seen in ensembles but which whedon pulls together with the greatest of ease joss whedon originally signed on for this project in april of 2010 he threw out former writer zak penn screenplay and replaced it with his own no disrespect to mr penn but sincerely doubt his version was better written than this whedon script shines brightly in nearly every conversation each one punctuated with his trademark never miss humor another thing he is known for is the characterization he imbues his writing with from buffy to the cabin in the woods whedon has never created character that is anything less than compelling rule that still applies even to cast as large and star studded as this interestingly and wisely this doesn feel like joss whedon the avengers this really does feel like marvel the avengers with joss cherry on top the characters still match perfectly with their prevous cinematic versions the character development is so strong in fact that in battle none of the characters feel like more superpowered thugs they are actual people fighting for their lives and humanity of course superhero movies aren usually known for their characters the special effects department really outdoes itself in this film from the nether regions of outer space to the showdown between iron man and thor visually the film never fails to dazzle the action sequences are filmed and edited with sort of grace with whedon signature shaky cam and midshot zooms thrown in occasionally for good measure unlike most movies the action scenes are not edited in quick shots the camera rotates around our heroes as they kick extraterrestrial ass and various other techniques are employed to keep action shots as long as possible though unconventional this ensures that the action is just as absorbing as the dialogue and works well to this effect allowing both of those aspects to support each other this attribute is extremely hard to come by in movies but where you can find it treasure it upon leaving this film which only did after the final credits had rolled many of those leaving with me were laughing and talking animatedly about this film recalling various scenes and how the quality fared in relation to other comic book films my opinion is that this is the second greatest one of the bunch second only to the dark knight story and thematic depth beat witty banter and numerous explosions any day however for those simply looking to be entertained right now you simply can do any better than this ', ' not sure on the really negative reviews thought it was good insight in to the backstory of black widow past with real focus on family and the struggles of separation action was on point just wish taskmaster had my more screen time and having it out with our main lead thought the back story we good and how it was all linked but overall good action movie well done marvel ', ' shortly after the events of civil war natasha johansson yet again nailing the carrying the weight of all the awful things she did before reforming which here is made one of the primary themes along with how found family can help process pain especially if it is shared experience meets back up with the three people none of whom are actually related by blood she shared what little she had of her childhood with sister yelena pugh delivering several perhaps more than any other one performer of the many emotional gut punches mother melina weisz applying her substantial brains to the situation and father alexei harbour both legitimately trying to be parental figures and occasionally really getting it right to once and for all accomplish what romanoff honestly believed she head done decades ago kill the evil general dreykov winstone as usual being deeply compelling as vicious individual here misogynist and destroy the red room where all black widows are broken down trained and stripped of any individuality obviously it would have been even better if this had come out years ago actually with little rewriting this could easily have come out an entire decade ago regardless of any other aspect the fact that this stars woman in the titular role has had people saying for years that it would automatically be bad it hard to argue that this would have come out upwards of 10 years ago if not for that one aspect think lot of people would have and many m sure did advise that it not rock the boat any more than that so it hard for me to overstate my relief and joy at finding that the movie is unapologetically feminist it uses the spy training which includes kidnapping girls when they are children to explore trauma caused by men against women obviously the specifics of what they experience is extremely rare and the details are hard to relate to but the notion that some people if not stopped are simply going to keep hurting any female they can really resonates ultimately it could go even further and it definitely would have been able to go deeper if not for the trusted mcu formula demanding frequent action scenes thankfully immensely talented director cate shortland does what she can and that a lot to keep those scenes as intense and impactful as possible by keeping the camera close letting us feel every blow there are some issues with the pacing and editing that are most likely down to the movie not being completely done shooting before corona restrictions were put in place and reluctance by the studio to postpone release until those rules were lifted decision which honestly is completely understandable won spend long talking about taskmaster other than to say that given what they clearly wanted to do there they should simply have come up with new character or picked one that actually suited their needs since now they have frustrated when that wasn necessary or intentional at all many who hoped for more direct interpretation and now merely distracts from powerful and carefully thought out depiction as far as the ideas that this is exploring they got it 100 percent spot on little visible blood and lasting wounds push the pg 13 rating recommend this to any fan of scarlett her depiction of the role of spy thrillers and of comic book adaptations 7 10 ', ' seems like pointless exercise to make film like this even more pointless to watch this failed attempt at movie there action but no real story conflict but no emotion save for the occasional attempt at comedy captain america the first avenger had everything you want characters you coiuld care for and story you could understand in my mind the series has gone steadily downhill ever since d find it more watchable if there were limit to the number of characters wish they stick to basic values and emotions ', ' marvel its not yours best like shnag chi but the film is very nice see it in thater in july 7 frogt to riveiw it but its was nice one buy not the one will want to whtch more then on or two times but thanks for bringing us shang chi marvel think your geting better with your films every time black widow was very nice film am not hyped for sqwel but if that will get one will want to watch it marvel ', ' try to write objective reviews but have to give credit to daredevil when first watched the show was amazed by the realistic fighting scenes and the suspension built episode by episode recently watched the 3 seasons again with my girlfriend and think this is one of the best shows ve ever seen am much of comics fan and ve never read any daredevil comic before the show so it was completely new character for me but the show is so thrilling you don have to like comics or superheroes at all for what it worth devil of hell kitchen is not superhero but just hero that can take beating well last but not least charlie cox is the greatest contributor to this show success he is great actor and vincent onofrio is behind the best kingpin portrayal ve ever seen he is really talented would be delighted to have new seasons but it been some time and hope at least movie will be shot since the legal obligations timed out ', ' the difficulty that most people are going to have with this show is the 2 and half episode slow start honestly think the writers and producers set out lot of troll bait in the first two episodes hang on for bit and the facade of stereotypical disney teen falls away at least as of this writing stuff gets real it reminds me bit of spiderman early days just as he getting hit with the reality of the world the main issue with the series will be lack of episodes to really get proper story and character development going seriously lot of the disney series need more than the 1 4 season they re getting all can say is be patient and hopefully in the end people will remember the fun rather than lack of fidelity to their favored philosophies ', ' am in the middle of season 1 trying to catch up on bunch of marvel series to get to defenders just finished jessica jones well daredevil is little boring but love vincent onofrio man in mask looks cute in combat scenes kidding and also special thanks for russians speaking russian finally omg this is amazing that fact makes me disregard things that don like why can they hire some russian speaking voice over actress to give proper russian to natasha black widow for example or use some voice over technique with actress real voice sorry this is just such pain pathetic anyways back to the topic keep watching for now my husband promise me that it will get better soon and that actually big marvel fan should continue ', ' agents of shield and agent carter are intelligently written and dominated by strong minded intelligent women m genuinely raging to read this has been rated as better on what grounds agent may ming na wen is phenomenal actress cast for her ability not just to tick box like the cast of this abomination it wasn funny the characters aren likable was bored and had no inclination to continue watching where is it better what is it winning on did watch the wrong show the marvel franchise is rapidly going down hill and it is not the fans who are wrong ', ' don get the hate it a decent movie and when you end up watching the mcu over in order it will be fun addition the people complaining about the over the top action guess forgot that this character has be back in time to space fought aliens multiple times uncovered secret regime in govt agency and probably hooked up with the hulk chill ', ' went into this with an open mind and really liked the first episode the lead did great job and her enthusiasm was contagious have no issues with any of the cast liked all of them especially mom and dad however every episode after the first got worse and worse the time travel and political back story just muddied the waters and was confusing the dumpster fire of series culminated with the capt marvel cameo in the post credit scene it felt forced and made no sense perfect ending to horrible seres this falls squarely on the shoulders of the writers and director if the mcu continues in this direction don know how much longer will be able to hold out and stay fan ', ' just don watch it not worth it the way the character grown into superhero person with powers on the first episode it just bad the hole first episode it just baaaaaaad though the special effect were good ', ' blinded as young boy matt murdock fights injustice by day in hell kitchen as lawyer with his best friend foggy nelson and recent acquaintance karen page at night he combats against the corrupt as vigilante first known as the man in black with the help of his colleagues matt murdock cleans up hell kitchen eventually becoming daredevil though am more of dc fan marvel and netflix daredevil was the best real life series adaptation of comic book character have ever seen this marvel netflix original series provides us with an incredibly addictive story and superb acting brought to you by charlie cox dare devil elden henson foggy nelson as well as deborah ann woll karen page and let not forget the amazing choreography for every action sequence everything about this series was remarkable and significant improvement to the 2003 daredevil however the graphic realism for some scenes is not for the faint of heart so parental discretion is strongly advised in the end this series was both thrilling and mesmerizing if you weren a fan of daredevil before you soon will be 9 stars ', ' season 1 was decent give that 7 season 2 is very different story somehow punisher became synonymous with woke feminist dingaling ', ' was looking forward to this one but it struck out on so many levels the characters were not cast as strong individuals but so often weak and silly that it did them the actors an injustice at one point the comedy devolved into plain silliness in such way that it broke the story down and threatened to change the direction kept looking at the clock wondering how much longer was going to be able to watch this did finish the movie hoping in some way it could redeem itself but it didn i liked the first captain marvel movie where there was strong character but this story was weak diluted and didn manage to make me care what would happen in the end ', ' it might turn out ok but ll never find out don recommend anyone spending their time on this it seems like forced commedy the plot the acting the main character only the dad is funny do show about him ', ' first things first the show has been pretty good so far there nothing to hate here so don fall for the reviews made by haters ll target the critics one by one 1 acting many people are complaining about bad acting let me tell you this it is iman first acting breakthrough so yes she might not be the meryl streep you are expecting her to be also she just kid give her break 2 the show is not marvel standard it marvel disney princess if you re expecting child to be as serious as captain america or have humour as sophisticated as dr strange or iron man than you re stupid af 3 it is kids show then what wrong with it why would show starring kid be as serious and as emotional as endgame 4 annoying character again the main character is kid and she will behave the same way if you find that annoying just think what your parents must have gone through having stupid kid like you could call out many such stupid things but ll just end with this this show is about kid told from the perspective of kid who is obsessed with certain things and this is according to me the best way anyone can represent kid world e the world through the lens of kid hope potential viewers will not get demotivated from watching the show just because few neckbeards disliked it edit just read review where someone said this show is meant to grab the attention of indians because they won watch stuff like black panther for your information as far as foreign cinema in india goes black panther was massive box office success reviews like these prove that the review bombing is more because of racism than genuine concern ', ' exciting series filled with twists and turns excellent stunt work and good storytelling it doesn disappoint love it ', ' why do all superheroes tv series are not about straight thinking and common sense who make use of their good powers instead they are about pessimism pathetic fixation to self isolation and self pity lack of common sense emotional and not very smart with bad judgement all of these just to emphasize the villains and make superheroes stories more like average human what the point of all the superheroes tv series cw loves self loathing heroes cbs offers naive but eager heroes and netflix just loves dark hero characters with many bad choices why do tv networks love promoting pessimism and extremism in human with super abilities why can it be about hero complex but remove the pathetic and obsessive factors there ought to be realistic balance between the heroes and villains with consistent storyline to stick to the original notion that sparks so many comic readers otherwise there is nothing special to it than just another vampire or ghost or dark side tv series ', ' tried to watch this 4 5 times but it very cheesy even for the mcu think it just geared for pre teen early teen so that understandable struggled to find it worth watching ', ' well some one who has atually seen the show can vouch that this show is amazing and not deserving of such low imdb ratings and let me tell you these low ratings come from hate against pakistan rather the show itself which mostly consists of indian viewers not hard to figure out just go see indian media gone all furious about it thou its crrazy how this show is good for them aswell being about brown superhero and other racist viewers who cant accept to see brown muslim super hero thus come the rating segregation with most rated it as10 or 1 rotten tomatoes critics rated it 98 highest mcu show and these critics know what they are writing about think imdb which has high number of indian subscribers should decide to either go for cheap viewership or choose authenticity and revise their rating algorithm otherwise it will die with time this show is fantastic and main charachter played by iman villani is job well done young actress who fit the role wonderfully and the family aspect of the show along with teaching its audience more about character building and showing that super heros are more than just being with powers is some much needed they have set new precidents for other shows to follow the soundtrack of the show is the best ve seen for long time and cgi is top class with story line targeting younger audience but adults can easily enjoy the show afcourse they could work on improving few things including villians of the show and can increase the number of episodes as we are loivng it so much but these things does not make it any less amazing ', ' good fighting sequence at times other that that poor story dragged out dialogues one of worst villains and the plot my 8 year old can come up with better than this yet so highly reviewed one has to wonder why being fan and purely following hero is understandable but no fan can succumb to this depth and compromise with seeing their favorite comic character in such struggling to stretch an episode series sometimes lagging and rushed at other times the flow in this one is so ridiculous daredevil please come and stop this madness season 1 was enough torture no season 2 please ', ' its just trash if you dont believe me just see it for yourself the title doesnt even match with the story thought it was going to be superhero show guess was wrong since it only tells us about rhe indian vs british war ', ' this show and the inhumans tv show are the worst marvel productions by far crappy characters with the exception of coulson and mae costumes dialogue you name it it poor quality all over can only attribute it declining popularity to the younger audiences probably under 10 years old otherwise can explain it luckily it seems that it chances for renewal are slim at best truly hope so because this show is crapping all over the marvel franchise ', ' the movie doesn live up to the hype there should be tag of family drama as well the movie lags in between and more important scenes should have more time allotted ', ' mcu wonder woman wanna be falls to the lowest this movie proved too little too late and full of stereotypical events that all of the action movies have they try so hard to make us foucs to the film with unnecessary explotions and mediocre fight scenes think this movie is to forget by all of the mcu movies ', ' jessica jones personality so frustrating to watch she is like young girl that didn grow up constantly watching drunken screw up with constant sarcastic bitch face don waste your time most of the low reviews on here are spot on ', ' from start to finish captivating and broadens black widow journey massively this is why missed going to the cinema ', ' it a bit more brainy than the other mcu movies there layers and layers to be read and interpreted obviously an agenda between the lines but besides everything they re talking about brie larson in the media the movie worth to be watched just wish brie had more charisma and her character bit more depth but she did fine besides all that marvel formula working as usual which is expected great photography easter eggs and references everywhere fan service good timing jokes here and there bring snacks ', ' keeping this review short captain marvel is not like most marvel movies it takes different approach to how it paces its story how it shoots its action and much more and m okay with that brie larson gave good performance here not great just hope she steps up in endgame ben mendelsohn nailed it as talos loved how they humanized the skrulls as much as some may not like that the big plot twist was actually really well done samuel jackson was actually great probably his best performance in an mcu film to date he seemed so energetic and loved it and yes goose steals the show don trust what others are saying hell don trust what m saying see the film for yourself and make up your own mind don fall into the trap of hating this film because of brie larson sexist and racist statements ', ' boring story and drama with good fighting sequence marvel just wanted to make her solo ', ' where to start found all the dancing music scenes cringe worthy as an adult the added comedy scenes are so bad the story line was dreadful who came up with that there plenty of cannon to take from the comics but no they come up with terrible idea and someone at disney passes it you can see that disney obviously influenced the writers as this movie was tailored for children only there is huge difference between the marvel of old and now that disney are running things or should that be ruining things disney needs to have hands off policy and they are truly messing up the franchise ', ' so far this is good show it funny has well written characters and the casting is top notch in my opinion like the chemistry between khan and her best friend the family adds nice element to it can wait to see where it all goes from here ', ' everything else tv produced by marvel and dc combined is quantity stool water material for the dumb public masses punisher is now cancelled however it will remain the only show created in the 21th century with some sense of substance and soul jon did decent job and has showed he a competent actor even if it debatable he was the best choice as frank castle the wise do not show trust towards greedy and corrupt disney future production of the punisher is likely gonna be better than this show perfection doesn exist but if new show does arise in the coming years at least do not hire ben barnes again ve had enough of overdramatic pretentious hipster actors in american tinsel town ', ' as someone who grew up in the former soviet union find it appaling that after all these years hollywood still can not get russia right from accents there are millions russian speaking immigrants in this country you really can find someone to consult on right phrases to say and get the right accents or have proper labels in the damn helicopter to factual mistakes lol when they shown black dudes in russian prison and then person with an oxygen tank no matter how inclusive you want to get there are barely any black faces in russian prisons ', ' really wasn sure if would like this read the first few volumes years ago and everyone complaining about her powers looking slightly different etc completely missed the point ms marvel has always been about her relationships with her friends and family and that aspect is 100 so much character and freshness ', ' how can someone get stabbed lose so much blood then get up in another world that she was cast into and have the strength to fight someone who has not been stabbed and also how did agent may escape all those izel left with her to stop her so many plot holes if you re not on the kool aid the fans of the show have drank you ll see this show for what it is utter mess there nothing interesting about it the show didn go anywhere but ran around in circles with the concept of time travel they really ran out of ideas they had to put this show out of its misery at least those who had normal brain and weren nerdy fans if anyone wasn a fan of this show they would watch an episode and laugh lot this show did not do well with lot of adults that might give you perspective ', ' well the movie was kinda good and bad it just wasn all that great ', ' first 20 minutes are stellar the opening credits are breath taking however after the first third of the film steady decline happens stakes are not felt action is mid third act is not memorable cgi mess should have come out right after civil war ', ' story could have been well made first 2 episodes are good but all the next ones weren upto the mark hope the other phase 4 movies tv shows will be good just for the connectivity of future projects fans need to watch this ', ' it doesn stand as good quality tv show after half season can stand it anymore as movie this is good story as tv show it struggle not being some boilerplate done as have being done by every other cheap 100 episodes tv show about crime violence or police investigations it can focus on one thing and do it great it have bad character introduction and it takes time to catch up with the background story of the character the side characters are terrible distraction and are boring to watch was wondering if watch show about someone called the punisher or not the torrent of reviews makes it like is some kind of bad ass 9 10 show but in reality it soap action drama that can rate as 5 10 ', ' without spoiling the show plot points in case you watch it soon here a little run down the show itself has basic super hero tropes but has some extra pieces of culture and information about muslim lifestyles and ideologies which is amazing to learn about however the exposition dumping and mass confusion of whether characters have grasp as to what is being talked about or if they don is so vague it feels like fever dream at times also why randomly with the show is there these really bad inconsistencies with the size and proportions of characters especially with the cgi but the positive parts about the change of kamala not being as egotistical as the kamala from the avengers game from square enix the color palette choices for shots and costume really captures well like the style that taika gave into with thor ragnorok and love and thunder they also had such nice way of really keeping things not so basic and having realistic home lives of teenagers in world filled with heros my final verdict about the show is that it a 50 50 it doesn have the same impacts as moon knight or the ideas of politics in falcon and the winter soldier or just the feel of avengers iw and endgame but it does have this nice new feel to it that do personally enjoy lot if you wanna go watch don go in negative or positive go neutral and build your opinion after watching all the episodes this review know is before the finale so it may not be as accurate as may think about it after ', ' feel like this movie could have been better one with better writers team and the main actor it seems like brie larson was not the best choice to play the role of captain marvel with the lackluster acting as well as the simply dull storyline that this movie followed through it may also have been the hype that has been built for this movie but regardless very disappointed in the movie overall ', ' first of really fun movie to watch not dull moment this action comic book based movie has more drama than a drama movie and it mixed with an array of great fighting scenes and pretty mind blowing visuals it got fair mix of humor perhaps some plot holes and whatever else and it fun to watch no doubt pleasant surprise indeed ', ' it is not expected of marvel to produce shows like this highly dissapointed show doesn centre around anything just creating confusion nothing more ', ' this film made me want to just leave the room and go on my computer or xbox it really boring and forgettable the directing is meant for drama not action movie but liked the characters and like how it explores black widows backstory ', ' 2020 no marvel at all dam sucks man not just with mcu fanatics but the entire theatrical industry all together dam glad the old normal is back in summer 2021 although safety prevention still needs practise while masks on what way 2 restart the phase 4 movie run series like wanda falcon and loki is just an appetizer black widow is main course and huge one great story great full scale action we shall see taskmaster again some time also got the feeling yelova will be the new black widow once she settles the score with hawkeye overall worth watching it in the theater nearby ', ' ever dreamed of watching three buff dudes beat the crap out of each other while saving the planet well avengers serves it up on titanium platter joss whedon somehow managed to shove billionaire in armor norse god and scientist turned mma fighter when angry into the same room and let be honest in real life these guys would be shooting at each other before finishing their drinks nick fury gonna need some serious cleaning supplies after this one between stark mega ego captain america old school sound like your grandpa vibe and thor who spends more time combing his hair than swinging mjolnir you start wondering if this movie should ve been titled ego wars but that whedon magic making you believe these guys can work together even though you half expect them to grab ball and just play pickup game still the movie makes you think these flawed heroes are exactly what earth needs well if you re into collapsed skyscrapers and city sized craters if we re talking avengers we ve got to mention the villain enter loki guy who decided that manipulating humans is way more fun than sorting out his family drama with his sneaky grins and baby tyrant speeches he like that dude at party trying to convince you the earth is flat after few mojitos hiddleston does his job well making loki both infuriating and fascinating he brings surprising complexity to guy wearing horns bigger than his ego but let get real you re here for the fights right the action in avengers is heavy so heavy it makes the battle of helm deep look like neighborhood squabble the highlight of course is hulk turning every fight scene into glorious apocalyptic chaos when you see him ragdoll loki like dirty sock you realize even gods can stand up to raging green behemoth if you re here for action don worry you re getting more than your fill black widow she basically the james bond of the group kicking ass in an evening gown without smudging her mascara as for hawkeye well we re still figuring out why he here but the guy got arrows and he does his best not to get overshadowed by the demigods around him he the dude who shows up to ferrari party with clio acting like he got nothing to prove avengers isn a movie that going to make you think too hard it action fun and pure spectacle it the kind of film where you scarf down popcorn knowing you re about to watch spandex wearing heroes save the planet while cheerfully beating each other senseless joss whedon understands that explosions are great but characters are even better so if you re in the mood to watch thor iron man and hulk smash things for two hours this movie got your name all over it ', ' it is not the greatest thing ever ir does have some cheesy moments but enjoy it and think it a fun easy watch while eating lunch it a shame it was receive bombed when the first episode dropped ', ' no spoilers but this show is already moving little faster than any of the other disney shows it genuinely very fun and the casting is pretty top notch lot of people online were complaining that this wouldn be relatable show unless you re teen girl but that is not the case at all cannot wait to see how this season plays out this might be my favorite first episode of any of the mcu shows so far ', ' everything about this show is blast the characters are fun and witty the writing is smart the anesthetics and tone are on point and the cinematography is beautiful love where the story is heading and have some theories about the future of this character kamala khan is character we need highly recommend this show you won regret watching ', ' believe the show is boring and the choice of the girl who is making ms marvel is totally wrong and even she doesn know how to act in general sorry but this year was not marvel year up to date and day by day we start losing interest hopefully they will wake up again ', ' putting thor hulk captain america and iron man all into one film was never going to be easy what with die hard fans of certain characters demanding they each have their moment to shine however joss whedon succeeds in creating such balanced film with huge cast he makes it look effortless avengers assember the avengers take your pick is one of the best films of the year and it hard to think of any other director who could have pulled it off sure there are many other great directors out there but whedon ensures that you don to have of read the comics to appreciate this the cast direction the script the editing very smooth cgi cinematography etc is amazing but m sure this has already been lot mentioned about it what made the film for me personally is the sense of camaraderie between all the characters as they work together that is essential in any war team film that depicts people working together each character is also nicely developed particularly bruce banner aka hulk supporting members including nick fury hawkeye and black widow are also given their time to shine and each actor is well cast while loki motif could have seen little more development the film feels nicely rounded and the action is amazing to watch as new york is torn apart the film is funny in places but never feels goofy or unnecessary pay attention michael bay whedon ability to keep the action fresh ensures that this film never falters and becomes tired avengers assemble is an amazing film that gives the audience what they want and more and is sure contender for the best superhero film to date while the dark knight rises comes closer to its release it is important to note that these are two very different films regardless there is something for everyone and strongly recommend watching it on the big screen ', ' the worst show of marvel dont understand why they even made it its show mainly to glorify community made by the people of that community no purpose of this show ', ' have been mcu fan for long but this series just make me wanna give up mcu no matter its storyline fight scene the cg everything is terrible and doesn make sense ', ' this show is action packed wow gotta love the production from netflix worth the wait for season 2 it simply the reason to get netflix ', ' just didn like season 2 elements of it were good but the pacing was awful just like most of these mcu titles they stretch single story arc over 13 episodes and that just doesn work this season reminded me exactly of dd3 in that there was endless time spent on characters discussing whether they should kill someone that a killer and evil feels so disney but more importantly it just drags on and on btw daredevil and punisher were my 2 favorite comics as kid look back and feel not much really happened very disappointing ', ' exactly what wanted from comic book movie loved every minute of it the pacing was just right all the jokes landed the action scenes were not that much disorienting considering the switching of characters and the chemistry between the marvels was amazing m not sure if you ll get the same satisfaction from the movie without previously watching the marvel series related to this movie but for me everything just clicked perfectly the movie also makes me want to see the future installments on the marvel mcu even when thought was done with those 100 recommend this movie to everyone ', ' disclaimer am comic book collector so my review is slightly biased by proxy but bear with me for moment the avengers comics are some of my favorite marvel comics besides the new avengers and the house of comics but the movie didn live up to the legacy of the comics the jokes in the movie were really good gotta give them that but humor alone isn a good foundation for movie unless we re talking about movies which pertain to the comedy genre which is clearly not the case here the biggest problem that personally had with the movie was the fact that 50 of the action in the movie happens on what appears to be spaceship that is reminiscent to those of the start trek franchise mean an invisibility cloak come on now is this joke because m pretty certain that the avengers quinjet didn have this feature in the comics last time checked anyway in my opinion they should have simply titled the movie attack of the spaceships because that the only consistent theme in the movie spaceships also all of the main protagonists acted like little children throughout the majority of the movie and then at the end they miraculously got hold of themselves movie logic furthermore the hulk development was completely unrealistic at first he is this uncontrollable mess that can be reasoned with but then at the end he has absolute control over his alter ego movie logic such learning curve is unrealistic to say the least on side note the new captain america suit looks goofy what were the costume designers thinking helmet remove the helmet and give him his protruding wings on his headpiece back for the love of god instead of aimlessly pumping out movie adaptations marvel should take it slowly and try to focus more on the quality of their movies quality quantity s m not even going to rant about the fact that marvel had to introduce yet another universe just to make the movies work because they are canon by nature ergo non compliant with the original marvel canon and the respective origin stories of the avengers s the reason why m so passionate about these types of movies comic book adaptations is because most people don really care about the franchise for them some fight scenes and explosions are completely sufficient not for me thought genuinely care about the franchise and would like to see movies that do the genre justice after all people like me nerds were the ones who made the comics success to begin with long before there were any blockbuster movies about super heroes ', ' the character is too far off from the comic books they changed her powers and the show focuses to much on religion and culture understand it important to have representation and it nice to see diversity but it doesn have to be the entire series that not what true fans want to see especially those of us who know the character and her feats and powers ', ' look respect all people loving this kind of movies but its not an 8 1 rate movie because this is not something for everybody and it cant just be assumed to be top movie when its movie for everybody it feels like someone have bought this rating on imdb it cant be real have tried to like this kind of movies several times but just cant watch them its not because its about superheroes but because they put all kind of superheroes in the same script they ruin superheroes its just not right could watch hulk or spiderman in seperate movies but in the same movie its childish ', ' ah the one star reviews as expected for movie like this right wing nut jobs that loose all hell when female lead hero is cast ll admit myself this movie has flaws but that doesn mean it not good first off it does start slow but once carol comes to earth the movie is endless fun with its flaws here and there the chemistry between nick fury and carol is one of the highlights of the movie we get look at how fury was before the start of the avengers and tony stark the action is great the humor is well balanced and the soundtrack is one of the best since guardians the real stealers of the show is goose and talos played by ben mendelssohn was phenomenal he was also villian in rogue one which was another great performance but this was easily his best this movie also ties in to endgame really well and it awesome to see this side of the mcu in the 90s of course this movie will have it flaws but the one star trolls who hate this movie because it different is ridiculous they all did the same to black panther carol is portrayed exactly like the one from the comics so it obvious these trolls probably don even know who captain marvel is if you dislike this movie than of course everyone is untitled to their own opinion but giving this one star is not needed if you hate it that much go back to watching batman vs superman or watch the fantastic four or michael bay explosion transformers ', ' probably is the best super hero show it has great story the coolest one shot action scenes ve ever seen and the main villain is thrilling nothing more to say because you must watch it ', ' so stan lee passes away and we get disney now in full control of marvel stories and boy is there difference could not finish watching this really bad film it is just junk from scene to scene the cast feel so sorry for them because the cast is fine group for the most part but the story the effects the directing are all jumbled up into real mess the premise is interesting but they have no idea what to do with it have never been fan of disney maybe when was 10 years old back in the early 60s but this is not at all walt disney this is disney inc and massive number of talentless paperwork and book keepers make their films these days this is just junk slammed together by people who have no idea how to tell story or stage intelligent effects this film is not turkey it is in fact just garbage rip marvel ', ' don know but it was boring show the pace of the episodes is very slow and the action is very little you expect more action in series called punisher but didn find what was looking for still the action scenes were good but don feel like wasting 25 hours just to see one or two fight scenes these scenes alone don make series of 26 episodes with an average of 1 hour each watchable the action scenes in the punisher series feel like an insufficient amount of spice to dish you can barely taste it instead of spending so much time with series that is not interesting at all watching videos on youtube where the action scenes of the series are compiled would save time at least stopped after watching 4 5 episodes because actually fell asleep during the last episode as for the drama aspect of the series couldn care about any of the characters so that part was pointless it just increased the number of scenes with lot of unnecessary dialog that had to listen to and watch that was the main reason that prevented me from continuing to watch the series after season 2 m not surprised that the series didn continue ', ' loved every episode it was amazing watching john bernthal as the punisher the best marvel series on netflix hopefully there will be season 3 and netflix would not stop the series ', ' expected bit of darkness to be honest like getting to see what exactly happens in the red room and portraying the pain and suffering the widows endured in full details instead of just casually dropping it in middle of conversation it just another family friendly action movie fun to watch but forgettable and could have been lot better ', ' honestly 9 3 this is the worst brutal mess there might be some kind of story below all the brainless brutality but lost my interest in watching again this is show that pushes the frontier of brutality as entertainment bit further this is nothing to be proud about do not want to know what the exaggeration of this will be in two or three years disgusting ', ' one of the greatest television shows ever created along with daredevil if netflix would of stuck with only punisher and daredevil they still be around ', ' incredible movie about family love movie full of lots of action ', ' one of the worst series ever attempted to watch tried the first episode but it was dreadful dirge both the acting and plot are terrible the series tries to shock the audience with it sex scenes and lesbian and mixed race relationships but fails miserably very much so 20 years ago and doesn help the plot which is disjointed enough without these failed attempts to shock the audience whatever you do don try watching this with your kids it is not suitable for younger audience am really disappointed with this and other netflix produced movies right now the conventional movies on netflix are also dated it is enough for me to consider canceling my subscription ', ' really enjoyed this movie great characters and cast lots of action and some really funny moments ', ' really very boring of first episode looks like it is made for children less than 10 years bad acting and bad story time wasting was expecting more from this series because of the name marvel in title but nothing is expected stop making such nonsense content ', ' this movie is all about the hype its existence is based on four years of gradually building anticipation in the nerd community so that now some of us are at the breaking point waiting for what we all hope could be the perfect movie the big question on all of our minds is was it worth the wait my response to that question is yes the avengers is shockingly good in every way the plot concerns loki god of mischief who after receiving magic death wand from some aliens yeah that about how much they tell you about it comes to earth steals the mysterious otherworldly megabattery the cosmic cube last seen in captain america from the supersecret spy organization h e d he kidnaps few of their scientists and agents and takes off concerned nick fury the director of h e d played by very awesome samuel jackson with no hair and an eye patch wants to begin rounding up earth mightiest heroes to combat the threat the government argues that it doesn make sense to round up civilians who happen to have acquired powers and expect them to act as dependable military task force fury argues that they don have dependable military taskforce equipped to handle god and an invading alien army so he goes ahead and does it anyway his heroes consist of iron man who has just completed work on an energy efficient tower that he can seem to stop talking about the true significance of which doesn come to light until the very end of the movie captain america who is understandably depressed since waking up seventy years after he last fell asleep and is trying to figure out if he has any place in the new world thor who is obviously having some personal issues because he feels responsible for his brother loki actions black widow who is technically not an avenger but just really talented agent who hangs out with them and hawkeye who is also just an agent but happens to be really good with bow so he also gets to hang out with the avengers cannot express in words just how impressed am that each character gets enough screen time to satisfy both the needs to see them and to have them grow in complexity somehow over the course of its two hour run time it manages to do justice to each of its characters simultaneously by bouncing their personalities off one another the action is plentiful and awesome the first half to three quarters of the film the heroes are fighting one another as their confliction agendas bring them to trade blows and that is entertaining we get to see hulk fight thor thor fight iron man black widow fight hawkeye black widow running in terror from hulk etc this is all unbelievably good fun and they all get to show off the full brunt of their powers because the other heroes are tough enough to take it when they finally do make peace with one another and get down to fighting the bad guys there as an endless wave of faceless aliens for them to tear in two smash electrocute explode shoot whatever without you caring about the deaths that come as result now for the bad parts and there were couple the opening action sequence when loki destroys the underground h e d base is too long and too boring also loki gives these weird speeches throughout the movie about how freedom is stifling or something and they didn make sense given his character he doesn need more motivation than wanting to be king to be doing what he doing and at the very least they could have done better job explaining his feelings about freedom think figured it out anyways but ll leave the interpretation to each audience member also there is great scene where thor is defending loki honor in the face of the understandable accusations coming from his teammates only to insist that loki only his adopted brother two seconds later for the sake of gag it bothered me lot because it was really interesting to see him still caring for his wayward family member despite his wrongdoings and what was with that alien loki was talking to the one with the two thumbs it looked moved spoke and was filmed like something out of bad sixties sci fi movie and mean the really bad kind in movie filled with awesomeness it stood out like sore thumb or two sore thumbs given its bizarre anatomy spoiler alert skip to the next paragraph if you haven seen the movie at the end of the movie when doctor selvig announces that while under loki mind control he maintained enough presence of mind to install failsafe kill switch into the portal generator couldn help but feel that the screenwriters had taken the lazy way out the fact that he did that makes all of their collective actions basically irrelevant and it undermines both their superiority and their heroism in no small way essentially they won the war because some guy didn mind control very well and that really lame this was the weakest point in the film and feel very strongly that there no particular reason that hulk couldn have just smashed his way through the unsmashable force field in the end the movie is unbelievably good fun and surprisingly satisfying given the wait it homages the characters and the stories of all the movies that have come before and it leads into whatever comes next very well oh and stay after the credits there an awesome clip for anyone patient enough to wait and don mean the one with the aliens mean after the longer credits ', ' good movie love the character of captain marvel and it was good movie marvel is going down with their content but now think they can come back and am waiting for the avengers secret war this movie contains alot of action and comedy so think it is good for marvel was waiting for this movie since it trailer was released so liked that movie the acting was awesome the character are good and like those spirit of the characters to make this movie carol danvers aka captain marvel has reclaimed her identity from the tyrannical kree and taken revenge on the supreme intelligence but unintended consequences see carol shouldering the burden of destabilized universe ', ' jessica jones is the next instalment in the marvel cinematic universe mcu following on from daredevil which also premiered this year set in the same hell kitchen jessica jones takes look at dark tones and topics such as depression guilt sex death rape and assault and this only makes the story drive more daredevil was dark but this is much much darker firstly one of the things that stood out for me right from the start is the beautiful cinematography and direction this show looks stunning there so much colour and vibrancy not only in the backdrop but in the characters too jessica is played by krysten ritter breaking bad who surprisingly without any major roles thus far shines throughout the season in powerful yet gentle and subtle performance david tennant is incredible with his take on kilgrave originally had no expectations for his character or his performance before watching but he really is convincing and quite menacing and creepy at times the music by sean callery is stunning and eerie just as it should be the titles are the first thing you see each episode so it had to capture your attention straight away and it does with elevator music elements and subtle piano melodies it all kicks off soon when the percussion drives in and takes control with blasting electric guitars and solo like touches which really pulls the mood together then finally settles you with the main title logo perfect it worth noting that although jessica has special powers there aren any huge scenes when special effects are used to amplify these moments of power and force it mostly camera tricks to show her strength and jumping and falling powers so if you re planning on watching for an over the top smash fest you won find it here also if you re ignoring the age certificate then ll warn you there are couple scenes of sexual nature my verdict jessica jones is another insanely good instalment to the mcu canon and should not be missed by any fan of marvel it even attracts the noir feel which has major potential to entertain even the casual comic book fan this is by far one of the best marvel series yet and possibly forever will be jessica jones 10 10 ', ' movie is just too forced the only good part was samuel jackson and 90 nostalgia everything else felt too forced black widow movie would have been 10x better ', ' the acting is superb every character has realistic wants and fears some very unique visual flair makes the first episode entertaining as we learn about the characters the story so far captures the characters from the comics well ', ' it was good of disney to show muslim and pakistani perspective of things especially how the india pakistan portion took place after british rule however the superhero storyline was very dull and incomprehensible ', ' one statement is people are bored of superhero movie and superhero fatigue is real second statement is even superhero movie makers are bored and have no idea what to give to people bcoz they have already given everything and they have saved the planet and the universe way too many times now this movie is another doomed superhero project by the beloved marvel who rarely went wrong before the endgame but not anymore every project coming out now is just plain stupid watched this movie for hardly half hour and that was also too much the first thing you would realise is it poorly edited like everything happens just to happen there is no stop about anything just one dialogue after another and another the same thing happens in aquaman 2 and same in this it will take hell lot of time for marvel or dc to get back on their feet bcoz there is nothing to offer one thing is for sure people like me who are with marvel from the time of iron man to endgame are done with it we used to wait for marvel movies but not anymore it doesn feel like that anymore can still go back to all those movies before endgame and enjoy them but these new aren just the same that connection is lost forever goodbye marvel ', ' had huge expectations on this movie but m not satisfied after watching it the first half was decent but then it gets worse every minute don even understand why there was villian in this movie as he had no screen presence at all it just seemed that they gave priority to solving natasha family issues rather than solving the real issues ', ' must admit that based on the trailers really really had wanted to like this movie everything about the movie felt very disjointed rushed and ultimately quite pointless for example in the ms marvel disney show they included bollywood style dance sequence that frankly in the context of that series fit nicely and didn feel out of place however when they ve tried including similar one in the marvels movie it just falls flat it comes out of nowhere serves no purpose and just feels weird and forced of course had the huge misfortune of watching this movie in 3d didn realise that 3d versions of movies are still made which means that there were constant exaggerated scenes with too much depth and ton of cgi to add to that watching the movie this way felt nauseating so as to not only bash the movie there are few things genuinely liked iman vellani as kamala khan is possibly the best addition to mcu post endgame her portrayal of the character feels very fresh and natural it is like she was made for the role also the montage where carol danvers monica rambeau and kamala khan are learning to use their joint powers together that part was actually well executed and quite fun to watch but unfortunately it was only few minutes out of very short movie ', ' expressed mixed feelings about the marvels acknowledging its scattered narrative but considering it an improvement over captain marvel lamented unwarranted negative previews and attributed marvel recent setbacks to the lackluster reception of quantumania and secret invasion and the sag strike hindering promotional efforts despite initial skepticism found the film more enjoyable than expected appreciated the portrayal of carol danvers as more expressive and even awkward character likening her to disney princess also found the kree perspective on captain marvel as unintentional villain intriguing though wished the film explored this aspect further drawing parallel to civil war the primary weakness according to was the underdeveloped villain dar benn serving mainly as catalyst for broader plot elements like the introduction of parallel universe men films and the formation of the young avengers highlighted unexpected cameos including valkyrie kate bishop and hank mccoy expressing relief at clearer direction for the mcu after somewhat meandering phase 4 in conclusion credited the marvels with reinvigorating the mcu providing hope for more focused and exciting future for fans ', ' the acting was okay the storyline was good this movie actually is far more enjoyable tuan captain america can see all the goodness and values that perhaps most people don see it look at all the hate brie is good and she is pretty enough ofc for the role stop hating ', ' going into this film with an open mind is must didn expect much of it based on other reviews that had seen in the lead up to to it but it was lot of fun and enjoyed it lot more than thought was going to the run time is short but it didn feel rushed and definitely worked for this group of characters the main 3 protagonists were great mix and worked well together and thoroughly enjoyed the big bad villain in it there are lot of funny moments spread throughout it in typical marvel fashion but it didn feel forced at least to me don knock it till you watch it it definitely worth the watch whether in cinema or once it released on disney ', ' so many plot holes terrible writing pathetic character development ', ' the avengers from last year is an amazing movie with such wonderful cast of actors from all over the place set in new york this exciting action packed movie is full of tense moments and wonderful scenes the talent of the actors and everyone who helped create the movie made it such an awesome movie to watch heros unite to stop an alien invasion caused by loki in turn to get back at his brother thor chris hemsworth if was an actor this would of been my first movie to audition for as lover of action movies all in all its must watch for all those action movie fans an exciting new adventure in the marval universe packed full of action scenes and excitement fantastic movie to watch and will watch again ', ' it taken me while to hop on board with the agents of shield legion of fans m huge marvel fan but as general rule m movie guy and not much for tv shows still recently started watching agents of shield roughly season and half late to the party just finished watching the first season this week and have to admit that am absolutely 100 hooked on this series ll start with the one tad bit of criticism that have it absolutely can be bit hokey and the first few episodes are perhaps the best example of that in other words it starts slow but hey hokey isn always that bad of thing and the cheesiness of agents of shield actually comes across as rather endearing that said as the season progresses it just gets better and better as comic book fan loved the way that it introduces new characters to the mcu and the way that it develops the shield organization throughout the first season the final few episodes which cross over with the captain america the winter soldier film are superb and really enjoyed the suspense that they entailed all that said think this is perhaps one of the best elements of the marvel cinematic universe and that saying lot since love the mcu films agents of shield has made me care about marvel property that never much cared that much for and it just good entertainment thus my 9 10 stars ', ' enjoyed it very much dont get why ppl are being so negative ', ' this first film about the avengers gives hope for the next films of the saga compelling first chapter with gorgeous characters tony stark is my favorite but thor steve rogers bruce and the others are also great loki is charismatic antagonist who wants revenge against his brother and his family nice villain superhero costumes are fabulous and also especially the cgi and special effects the direction of the fights is excellent the setting of new york is wonderful there is also lot of humor which makes us understand the difference between the mcu and dc that is that marvel focuses not only on action like dc but also on relationships and laughter positive note is that it is so noticeable that relations between the avengers are mostly cold also noting many conflicts between the characters another thing that think made the movie better than it could have been is marvel organization to create first introduction films for the main characters and then group them all into one spectacular movie robert downey jr chris hemsworth chris evans scarlett johansson jeremy renner mark ruffalo samuel jackson and tom hiddleston were fantastic it wasn right for what they did to name just few first chapter of exciting saga we hope it will remain so forever or even improve rating 9 10 ', ' have many word to describe this disaster silly low budget tv movie like but don think it is worth my effort m just sorry for the 30 paid for it ', ' as the follow up and spin off of the avengers item 47 helped to solidify the spin off series agents of h e d felt outrageous that lizzy caplan talent wasted on 12 minute short she would ve been great addition to the mainstream mcu films ', ' season 3 ruined should have called this season trish walker boring and she is not convincing superhero got powers and boy is the character stupid ', ' honestly when saw the pic of ms marvel months ago wasn expected the series to be this good marvel did very good job on making new color of super hero cool ', ' bland and unimpressive black widow was below average entry in the mcu to care about the story must first care about the characters unfortunately knowing natasha fate at the end of avengers endgame made my interest in her character falter the film took blind stab at natasha past while also trying to introduce new characters to the mcu unfortunately nothing substantial was added to the story of black widow the gravity of budapest was lacking the truth behind the black widows was ill conceived and was just bored throughout there were few unique moments of storytelling and some clever callbacks to other entries in the mcu florence pugh was great though all the fake russian accents were grating at times had this movie come out right after civil war would have enjoyed it more unfortunately knowing the fate of the main character makes this film seem like an afterthought ', ' the worst thing can write about this show is that it won be renewed can imagine disney ever carrying on this franchise which is sad the punisher is brilliant simple m fan of the marvel movies etc but they re aimed at mainstream audiences and in my opinion are too full of slap stick comedy this however holds no punches it brutal from the very first episode to the very last just pray the big wigs at disney do the right thing and carry on shows like this and daredeveil ', ' while the heroic anti heroic necessary evil moral debate is fascinating one am not inclined to gorefests and if it were not for the positively bewitching spectacle of this frank castle in daredevil doubt would have ever looked up an episode this is in its visible pain and suffering to the protagonist its weird light moments that come at unexpected but much needed junctures and its refusal to drape any sort of justification over punisher and his actions refreshingly honest appraisal of violence role in survival and its slowly toxic influence on living life not made of conflict jon bernthal draws me in irrespective of my feelings about frank in the moment and conveys the sisyphean struggles of once good man now broken ', ' heard the bad reviews but then thought marvel very rarely misses maybe it just because she a women then went to the theater this was disappointment for many reasons there was entirely too much obvious cgi the story was not very good and the humor seemed forced was looking forward to the movie now dread seeing her in avengers but maybe the russo will do better with the character ', ' baffled by the negative reviews this show is incredible every character is truly fascinating and we get glimpses of their back stories to supplement the story if you are looking for show with well developed characters chilling villain compelling and relatable main character an intriguing storyline and just utterly spectacular acting this is the show for you no it not typical superhero show it goes above and beyond in so many aspects this has raised the bar for superhero stories in my opinion krysten ritter is superb and very believable as jessica jones love love love this show ', ' really tried to like this show unfortunately it not going to happen find the stories dull and uninteresting and find nothing appealing about the characters even coulson has lost his appeal the only redeeming episodes are those that had connection to the movies and the marvel universe that being the case the writers must realize what we fans want we want more superheroes the show lost its chance twice at the very least on the pilot episode was sure that the character played by august richards would turn out to be luke cage even though felt luke cage should have been larger and on the girl in the flower dress episode who the hell is scorch missed the opportunity to include real marvel villain yes superheroes cost more to make in terms of special effects but many need little effects characters like luke cage iron fist daredevil punisher and so many more ', ' yes know this is targeting younger audiences but did it really have to be so disney channely could still improve but doesn feel like it hope this isn too important for future mcu stuff cause don think have the patience to watch this series ', ' the story is one of the more captivating hit home stories from the marvel universe took my daughter and her 1st words after was love this movie touching while bringing in story lines from previous movies lead characters played strong roles scarlett was awesome as always such diverse actress this movie had serious moments as well as very humorous moments that hits home with growing number of families not sure better family story with deeper meaning has been written with any marvel movies consider this one to be the least action filled but one of my favorites marvel continues to pleasantly surprise ', ' am 60 year old man that enjoys being entertained and black widow accomplished that sure there are some plot holes and some wokeness but some story holes are filled and in typical mcu fashion there are threads that lead elsewhere florence pugh was great presence and look forward to her next appearance in the mcu one tiny little spoiler it appears that david harbour escapes from russian prison twice ve had crush on rachel weisz since the mummy for cryin out loud grab your popcorn and let yourself be entertained ', ' is it good film not really enjoyed some of the humour and the fight scenes but the script is weak the villain is underdeveloped the cgi seems dated and the conclusion is just another marvel fireball in the sky pugh is brilliant harbour is underused johansson is passable and winstone is awful seriously after the departed didn anyone realise that he can do accents taskmaster deserved better than this ', ' the title says it all what fall from grace season 1 brought the comic book to life with great cast of characters superb performances and an engagingly complicated plot the drama the tension the excitement and the brutality of the fights all felt real the stakes were slowly but gradually raised with each episode so that as we became increasingly invested in the characters the consequences of their choices mattered it ranks as one of marvel best adaptations on netflix season 1 9 10 season 2 starts promisingly seemingly dealing with the fallout from season 1 but the writing is awful and the tediously slow moving plot is boringly predictable characters we previously admired as competent professionals suddenly act unreasonably stupid taking you out of the story the writers really came up short this time and no amount of brutally violent action can make up for their failings without well constructed story involving characters you care about the succession of fight scenes become meaningless and devoid of drama this season is giant misstep which the series may not recover from daredevil managed to redeem itself with season 3 but whether the punisher can do the same remains to be seen regardless season 2 is huge wasted opportunity especially after the exemplary season 1 what disappointment season 2 5 10 average 7 10 ', ' d enjoy it more if the characters enunciated clearly had to turn the volume up high and both us still could hear lot of the dialogue especially early on lot of bbc dramas had this issue few years back the protagonists also aren really relatable as others have said its target is probably more the 6 10 age range ', ' can belive it they made is such mess am gonna be honest action is ok family drama is also ok nothing depth in story the movie was like studio just fulfilled fan demand and nothing more than that this movie is easily forgettable this movie doesn add anything in long run except post credit scene last but not least post credit scene was lot better than 50 of the movie ', ' combining captain marvel from the previous film ms marvel from the tv series and captain rambeau the newbie was going to be gamble from the start being the shortest mcu film to date the action moves along at brisk pace and the power swapping aspect was handled well the story is both follow on from captain marvel and secret invasion kinda iman vellani is joy as kamala khan ms marvel geeking out about being close to her hero carol danvers the film was obviously written to appeal to the tween audience that ms marvel appeals to but thats not necessarily bad thing samuel jackson is great isn he always but underused nick fury role in the avengers seems to be bit vague while not the best mcu film by long shot it is miles better than the train wreck that was thor love and thunder or for that matter thor the dark world it time for the mcu to start making strides to build momentum again after the emotional double whammy of avengers infinity war and avengers endgame those 2 films set the bar so high others feel like they are not evel close when they should be setting up bar of their own ', ' this show is interesting for sci fi fans but lot of potentials are wasted within especially for marvel fans it would be much more interesting considering some potentials for example it could be great opportunity to link men story line to other marvel stories at the other hand before watching the show one may expect lot of screen time for agent fury while the show is oriented mainly around agent phil coulson this is not bad thing at all in fact the character is well explained and developed but it wouldn hurt to include some more fury also agent may and quack story line get boring in some points regarding positive aspects must say have met one of the loveliest characters in sci fi enoch in this show what great lovely and memorable minor character great job introducing him also the show have been very successful in explaining the history of shield and its formation challenges vulnerability and agenda the governmental links still remain hidden though maybe stargate sg1 like hints to relations with the government would make it more realistic in the introduced logic of the show overall it is entertaining but could bore you at some points ', ' gotta admit was not ready for all that shaky cam action mean you could clearly see that the choreography for the fight scenes was good enough for superhero movie but why did you have to add so much shaking and cutscenes ', ' the avengers is 2012 adventure action film directed by joss whedon and starring an ensemble cast that includes robert downey jr as iron man chris evans as captain america chris hemsworth as thor scarlett johansson as black widow mark ruffalo as the hulk and jeremy renner as hawkeye the movie follows these superheroes as they come together to save the world from an alien invasion led by the villainous loki tom hiddleston one of the strongest aspects of the movie is the chemistry between the cast each actor brings their own unique take on their character and their interactions with one another are both humorous and engaging the film action scenes are also impressive with mix of practical and digital effects used to create thrilling set pieces the plot is well crafted and engaging with good balance between action character development and humor the movie does great job of juggling its large ensemble cast giving each character their own moment to shine while also moving the overall plot forward the direction by whedon is confident and assured with strong visual style and keen sense of pacing the cinematography by seamus mcgarvey is also impressive with mix of handheld shots and steady compositions that give the film sense of energy and momentum the musical score by alan silvestri is standout with memorable main theme and well placed motifs that help to elevate the film emotional moments however the film villain loki can feel somewhat underdeveloped at times while tom hiddleston brings sense of charisma and wit to the role the character motivations and backstory are not always clear making him somewhat one dimensional antagonist overall the avengers is an entertaining adventure action movie that succeeds in bringing together some of marvel most beloved characters on the big screen with strong performances impressive action scenes and well crafted plot it is highlight of the marvel cinematic universe and must see for fans of the franchise ', ' this marvel studios film is the best superhero film we ve been waiting for so long for everyone to watch and have whole lots of fun with superheroes this is amazing go iron man captain america thor hulk black widow and hawkeye the avengers will return ', ' while the premise is sound people with super powers some using them for good while others use them for bad are pitted against each other the acting is grade mediocrity and the plots within the premise are at times laughable the scene at the police station comes strongly to mind how many times can one blurt at the television all you have to do is insert plot line suggestion here it becomes obvious within short time that the characters will do the wrong thing time after time predictability is not this show strong point while marvel usually makes characters who are fit for watching by the whole family this one descent into foul language and soft core pornography takes this character into the adult realm from which she will not return all in all it is groaner which needs some serious script massaging hopefully by new writers it can be saved but will it not with the current crew running the show ', ' daredevil is the most hyped new series of this year and the crazy high ratings in imdb can led anyone to think this is masterpiece the truth is it not this is nothing but mediocre vigilante show that tries to impress people by having more gore than average mcu shows now never read the comics but this show felt really flat to me the story is neither engaging nor great in fact it felt very forced the characters were really bland in fact the titular character felt nothing more than nice guy trying to do the right thing from beginning to end there is absolutely no development for him from beginning to end he feels too generic his gang of supposed to be comic relief sidekicks are also nothing more than copy paste character with super corny dialogs and there little to no development for them across the show you will come across gang of unnecessary characters only to have them killed off but have to give praise to vincent onofrio because main antagonist fisk was the best character in the show and well written one he has significant development while storyline from our hero point of view is too boring fisk pov was great and engaging acting was good most actors were very professional with their performance the action was pretty well done although they are nothing but elaborate fight scenes of our hero fighting gang of criminals and kicking there asses while getting his ass kicked sometimes the cinematography is decent soundtrack is average and if you are someone like me who searches for logic and realism in these things oh god you are going going to world of unlimited pain you won understand character interactions motivations chemistry goal physical ability and at the end of every episode you will think how the hell this guy recover so quickly in the end if you are someone like me who has no idea about the comics and are tempted to watch this because of these extra high ratings don you will be disappointed ', ' m in shock this show is so utterly boring and non engaging it far and away the worst marvel production far worse than eternals had to fast forward huge cringey chunks of this show to get through most episodes this should not have been released under marvel and probably be put on disney plus with hannah montana and the ilk as it is tonally off with the rest of marvel now they are going to shoe horn this into the mcu with the marvels what disaster the only reason this gets 2 instead of 1 is the special effects which is not great so therefore no redeeming value don bother don waste your timel ', ' the action was amazing with the family story little slow in parts but was laughing and super engaged ', ' one of the best series ve seen so far and m actually more of movie fan but this series with it very well played characters and exciting plot twists kept me glued to the tv screen even after two seasons m still not bored with this series like said m more of movie fan and most series ve seen with more seasons couldn keep my interest after the first season but that absolutely not the case with the punisher read that netflix canceled the series after season two but really hope they or another company will come back on this decision so we can enjoy season 3 and 4 and 5 ', ' saw this film at an advanced screening the other night with bunch of friends and it was fantastic evening out phenomenal cast all deliver with brie larson giving fine performance in the lead as woman discovering exactly who she is her brand of snark was right up my alley and m excited to see her in wider team dynamic the plot seems fairly straight forward to begin with but various twists and turns keep you guessing throughout the film also ties together various elements of the wider mythos of the mcu and my questions going in about how she fit into the universe were met with surprising yet satisfying answers unfortunately origin stories for marvel tend to be their weaker efforts with lot of exposition and not packing quite the same emotional punch as when the character is fully established so overall this is middling marvel effort which means it is still solid film with lot of humour and heart make sure you stay for both credit scenes ', ' natasha breaks up with the avengers right after civil war and goes on the run from the accords only to catch up with piece of her past she thought no longer was thing this felt more of like lunch time movie than friday night movie and by that mean it one you don plan your evening around but one you sit to watch while you munch down just to not stare at the wall not to say it bad if you ve read most marvel comic books then this is like one of many average side stories they make throughout the year good comparison would be the prelude comics they make for the movies people can just ignore them and they would be fine or they can read them and still feel unprepared and unimpressed specially considering the weird time it was released in both in reality and in the context of the mcu nevertheless it has great choreographies and good portrayal of character emotions both scarlett and florence are very good on their roles at least when they are actually acting and talking the premise is bit overblown and dumb at times it also feels structurally weird for movie some things aren paid off enough and just are though it lacks in importance like captain marvel did and doesn build anything on top of what we already have specially not for natasha you could skip it without issues m also not fan of the treatment the ghost character received in ant man 2 sadly task master is adapted similarly relegated to the side and lacking in development personally had expectations and so felt disappointed with another wasted character and in all sure watched it but expected more ', ' after waiting couple weeks finally got to see the avengers with my movie theatre working friend yay have now seen captain america iron man thor and the hulk battle loki and his minions from asgard as the latter try to invade new york city co written and directed by legendary tv icon joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer angel and firefly he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters we ve grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the four color world they inhabit and seeing it all in 3 is such an awesome experience oh and it great in also seeing hawkeye black widow and nick fury in tow really all ll say is you must watch the avengers s seeing cobie smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her how met your mother co star alyson hannigan formerly buffy star have traded stories of what it like to work for mr whedon how d like to be fly on that wall ', ' the worst movie ever seen dont know if is anithing worst he used the marvel label to sell tickets but dont think has any thing to do it can belive it that in 2021 existe an making such movies only star is for scarlet because is good actress in rest garbage shame ', ' the witty dialogue tries too hard to be funny and just becomes annoying after awhile without having any background information about this character this show means nothing to me marvel seems to overestimate how interested we re going to be in their obscure comic book characters ', ' the whole series could have been fit in 30 minute episode just what we need is bunch of bolly wood fluff am great fan of the marvel universe and this show did not add to it but detracted from it suppose this is to be expected since marvel has seem to fun out of stories for their primary better characters the storyline if you can call it that was ludicrous can only assume that this show is not for my target demographic have been comic reader since the 1960s and big fan superhero movies and series there have been many awful shows done over the years but this is among the worse if you feel need to watch this series start on episode 4 the first 3 episodes really not worth watching ', ' the film was phenomenal it explained the hero origins of captain marvel aka carol danvers perfectly and without confusion ve been kept entertained for the whole 2 hours which is uncommon in some mcu movies like thor and thor the dark world thor trilogy is just bad except ragnarok also loved the humor it was just perfect now for the actors everyone had doubts about brie larson and that her acting would be cold and emotionless but after watching just disagree she absolutely nailed the role it really was like she was captain marvel if know what mean not to forget stan lee cameo and also the endgame scene after the credits overall would give it an 8 10 and has inserted itself into top 5 mcu movies ', ' really shouldn write review for movie fast forwarded through as much as did this one but something this strange warrants noting first the pacing the pacing of the earlier films was mostly impeccable fight scenes didn last too long and were broken up by cool cgi and character turns here endless chase fight sequences glazed eyed boring to everyone other than 11 year old boys who are truly jazzed up by cars flipping through the air bang pow screech crash 10 minutes 20 minutes my god it 30 minutes now after while muted it and started skimming the news on my phone missed nothing why abandon famously winning formula for juvenile hackneyed one strange second characters the black widow was fascinating in the earlier films for her combination of uncanny fighting skill and complex personality that almost completely missing here after waiting for this film with great anticipation found myself not caring about her at all don recall the last time so completely lost interest in character never want to see her again wiping out interest in an avenger have to credit the director and writers with that strange achievement finally and worst there no fun here the marvel movies have been marvelous fun in combining real suspense with wit originality with splashes of satire danger with warmth you laughed moments before you held your breath here did neither if that bit about chopped up uterus was supposed to be comic relief jeez no if dad congratulating his daughters on all their murders was supposed to be funny jeez no black widow is more like gritty cold war film from the 1960s brooding dark depressed gruesome grim maybe it partly the unrelentingly gloomy score what strange turn take great party and pour dirty ice water over the whole thing ', ' has to be one of my top 3 worst movies have ever had to endure would have rather paid someone to not have gone then to waste hours of my life going to the movie theatre for this pile worst marvel movie have ever watched ', ' grew up reading and drawing comic books and what the mcu has done is nothing short of amazing to see these stories read as kid being presented so well and cohesively on screen is incredible however was an adult by the time this version of ms marvel came along so was not familiar with her ms marvel was carol danvers when was kid going by the name of binary in most of the men stories that recall unlike most marvel properties that am very familiar with and read for years before the movies came out knew nothing about kamala kahn and this version of ms marvel went into this with low expectations because it looked little goofy and came out of it really enjoying the entire series think it helped that didn know anything about the character which is bit of first for me when it comes to marvel characters also if this had been your average white dude from new york getting powers think it would have been lot less interesting and far more vanilla at least to me because we have seen that story thousand times bringing in the pakistani and muslim elements made it much more interesting to me because didn know lot about this culture religion and history stayed up reading about the partition that the characters kept referring to for few hours after finishing the series because although had heard of it didn know anything about it other than something that happened in india long time ago think this might not be everyone cup of tea get that and there are some goofy elements to it even for comic book movie but to me this was something new and bit refreshing also while the series was extremely well cast all the way around the lead actress iman vellani is extremely talented she should have bright future ahead of her the directing for was also extremely well done really enjoyed this series ', ' mean he got great cheekbones and embodies the character but let be real there really no reason this got such high ratings it just murdering and gore every episode the story is kind of hard to follow and it makes for very thin reasons to just add in more of the violence find the characters unbelievable and it doesn make sense that they get away with any of this it nice you include women in these kinds of stories but some of the women characters are really annoying no cool factor all the characters aren likeable except curtis ', ' hate to say it but m just not that interested in the more minor characters in the mcu so my rating may be biased the action was intense as expected also get ready for get another film full of long choreographed fight scenes also if you are watching these film in chronological order there is major spoiler after the credits ', ' stunning and bold according to self described strong female speech writer this started well for couple of minutes then went down hill didn wait to hit rock bottom with it ', ' as long as you don really try to follow the plot it is rather watchable and entertaining ', ' the characters the plot the betrayal the action ahhhh and the list goes on let just say if you aren watching this show then you are missing out highly recommend you will not be disappointed ', ' after over year of waiting black widow was finally released and let just say it did it job but there was so much more to be said cate shortland did good job on clarifying events and ideas from the prior mcu films while also doing decent job on elaborating on fan favorite character like natasha romanoff but she definitely could ve fleshed out the plot lot more making this film feel little bit like filler setup to the saga with the events shortland was telling feel as if this film was released few years ago it would ve been more hard hitting and relevant more than feeling little redundant with not lot of consequences black widow had pretty solid pace up until the second act where it seemed to slow down and really drag out that two hour and fifteen minute runtime the protagonists are what really carried this film to be as good as it is having wonderful performances across the board from scarlett johansson florence pugh rachel weisz and david harbour everyone was balanced well and had really good chemistry together especially johansson and pugh my biggest issue with the film is how they handled the black widow character yes we received some decent input on her character but she didn really do too much reminding me lot of prince challa from black panther another issue had was that they didn make strong present villain shortland decided to make the villain more of talked about threat if you will falling into the trap lot of the mcu films have and that not having strong villain the action in the film is mixed bag there were some scenes that worked for me being very entertaining to watch but there was surplus of action that was butchered up in the editing room and gave it silly video game feel overall would definitely see this film at least once because of the importance it has to the saga but this falls in line with the middle of the pack films for the mcu saga ', ' this tv show is very good for me it is totally for adults due to the violence they have and especially how they show it it very entertaining and like everything in marvel it always has bit of comedy ', ' the punisher is up there with daredevil for the best marvel tv series of all time personally would put daredevil slightly ahead but that no insult the punisher frank castle already had back story from his appearance in daredevil and what story it is the back story gives the writers cart blanche to make frank castle as psychopathic as possible without turning him into villain frank not the only great character agent madani is well acted and scripted too micro is an another great character with his own skillset and tragic back story curtis holye provides nice calming influence on the chaos around him and there also some great little twists when it comes to villain character development would definitely say that series 1 is the best the story in series 2 seems to get bogged down bit and some of the main characters go missing at times also the violence gets more and more ridiculous as series 2 goes on we all know that the violence in these marvel sub universe series is over the top but there is limit and series 2 goes beyond that another niggle is that the episodes are too long and there too many of them 13 series 2 especially seems to have quite bit of padding these are only small niggles and overall it is brilliant production and well worth 20 or so hours of your time ', ' as much as it is enjoyable it just typical marvel movie where you knew what was going to happen jokes fast paced and good action scenes they have ruined taskmaster though but that is not surprising at all ', ' hardly any back story felt like the story was bit rushed ', ' from the comics to video game knew what to expect from this character and this show was disappointed with the change of powers and origin but was still able to enjoy the show regardless and will continue to watch the rest of the season iman vellani was perfectly cast as the role of kamala khan in this series look forward to more stories and media from this character in the future ', ' wow what an amazing insight into the world of matt murdock lawyer by day vigilante by night an amazing roller coaster ride of full pack action and fighting against crime syndicate wilson fisk show becomes great not by its hero but by it villain said by someone 9 10 marvel always shines ', ' watched the first agents of h e d with mixed feelings not really good but not that bad the story was ok if not good but when my college asked how it was said yeah well it was ok let see the second the 2nd one so sketchy that couldn even finish it actors are bad characters are clownesque ming na in bad ass is not credible at all this series is made for pre teens the story is worst the 2nd episode looks like the old movie commando with schwarzeneger the part saw everything so predicable that is not funny at all m not gonna follow ', ' this show is rubbish and patatic disappoint marval fans never watch like this shows they are wasting your time am very very disappoint about that show why the makers make this stupid show ', ' disclaimer did not read any of these comics daredevil arrow or the flash positive and negative part about not reading comics is not having bias this series set new bar in terms of lot of things always had perception that only dc has dark stories and has comics with deep meaning this series changed that love both dc and marvel but for different reasons the fights were done exceptionally well all actors fit perfectly in their roles you could connect with lot of them charlie cox pulled off both matt murdock and daredevil to perfection liked the black attire of both daredevil and fisk the aspect did not like was development of certain key characters which believe did not justify the role they played and their actions likewise specially vanessa caren stick and claire but think with the limited screen time there is only so much that the think tank of the show could do overall it was the right trigger for the defenders and m going to definitely wait of daredevils 2 and other marvel series leading up to the defenders ', ' very strange is the result of black widow marvel movies are not my cup of tea but someone is very successful like iron man the avengers or guardians of the galaxy the other films of the saga very often fall into the very forgettable we do not know how touches their subject in an interesting way as was the case at times with captain america the winter soldier black window is on this point above almost reaching the top of the basket story sometimes unexpected sometimes unsurprising tribute to james bond femme fatale version we feel the potential to touch strong subjects such as the abyss of destructive patriarchy yet full of good ideas the film does not really manage to treat the whole and become master stallion whereas with little more time and less unsightly spectacular when the family reunites before the final confrontation the film shows that he could have been very strong instead he hovers over gives compelling reasons to connect the pieces with the saga and ticks the boxes of the blockbuster marvel without conviction this is how the film scuttles itself not knowing how to take these distances with avenger in fact it a bit of mess but at times it offers real good time special mention to yelena belova actress florence pugh is really what we will remember ', ' as brown guy didnt like it inclusion is fine but it didn feel realistic at all farming emotional views by showing the partition isn the way to go imho and no we don say chalo and beta with every sentence we speak ', ' thank you for the best superhero tv series the heroes villains side characters all are relatables and real and think it will go down as the best television has to offer ', ' alright have made an account specially to write review about this movie this is my first review of movie so guys please excuse me for my little mistakes or faults saw this movie yesterday in india and must say this that this movie is the best super hero movie so far movie is full of star cast and every person in the movie have played his role like boss specially mark ruffalow and robert downey are epic in the movie the script cinematography humor punch lines action all are fantastic its must watch movie for marvel fans s if haven watched iron man hulk thor or captain america then its totally cool cz guys will still enjoy this movie so you need not to worry about this part ', ' very boring maybe if was pre teen girl might see some point to this first marvel series turned off before even finishing the second episode ', ' indeed iman vellani was born to play ms marvel she does everything in way even many grown ups can only 19 and damn she is brilliant she is the real treasure in the show get her on big screen already eagerly waiting for the remaining episodes it funtastic welcome to marvel universe iman she rocks ', ' saw this film last thursday night and was mostly not disappointed by the outcome liked how we dive little deeper into natasha origins and her family it the film we ve been waiting for for 10 years it was cool seeing her family and their traits one downside is that even if it a black widow movie yelena natasha sister steals the show lot during the film it nice to see her but would ve liked more black widow in the film really whenever yelena or alexi are on screen they steal the spotlight the villain was develop ok sort of and so was natasha family the action scenes in this film don need some magic for sci fi it like action from james bond movie and it works well with this movie another issue have with the film was that the start was pretty good but the rest of the film just kind of falls also hated how they portrayed red guardian in this movie they treat him like he an idiot and wish there was one moment where he had chance to shine as red guardian just hope not to see any black widow family memes overall decent mcu return to the big screen ', ' can explain what an awesome season they had produced bullseye worthy villain most of all wilson fisk brought the season back to life this is how make season ', ' have heard lot of people complaining that this is the worst marvel movie ever as someone who has zero expectation watched it like novice well not exactly novice since ve watched captain marvel wandavision and ms marvel all prerequisites for watching this movie well not exactly but you ll get much better understanding of this movie if you ve watched all three of them and after watching this movie till the end must ask what with the negativities cause didn see anything bad about the movie if you re talking about how the super villain is so plain well that tends to happen when you ve seen so many super villains before this they all kinda look the same think story wise this movie has very unique and interesting plot like the switching glitch of the trio heroines it funny and sometimes fatally dangerous and seeing kamala khan freaking out after meeting her idol is cute and monica reunion with carol is touching also that mid and post credit scenes are promising new refreshing sequels honestly what are all complaining about the worst marvel movie my to me the worst one is still black widow it always will be hopefully from this moment hope it will only get better ', ' it was very promising but they started chasing and the endings very soon it should always be 1 discovering some powers during small fightings or for protection infront of danger 2 using it to help people 3 villians appears 4 discovering the ultimate power during big fights vs villians villians showed and chasing in every episode and believe me it boring and keeps the fans watching just to complete the whole marvel series ', ' m swearing off super hero movies ve become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who can wait to see what hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters but after three iron men and now this see sameness in them all and m not equipped properly to enjoy them as should m still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at the special effects are beyond belief and some of the characters have some dimension that said think would need manual to really get the true impact of each character what his or her powers are and how they fit together there is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others this is what makes comics what they are read lots of comics as kid so do understand the milieu when you get right down to it however they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy it like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way it a cast of characters what represent simple things both good and evil ll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines ', ' suggested drinking game take 1 shot every time wilson fisk says venessa 2 shots when he says city and 3 when he says this city ', ' if this movie is any indication of what the young avengers will become then the young avengers is doomed to fail don get me wrong loved the first captain marvel movie it was amazing for the second captain marvel movie expected more of the same instead screen time had to be shared with two other captain marvel want to be and neither one of them delivered especially the child she was completely unbelievable and destroyed the fourth wall during the entire movie wonder who disney thinks is going to buy 20 movie tickets to see children pretend to be superheroes who is going to drive this child audience to the movie theater because they won be able to drive themselves disney is making huge mistake taking the franchise in the direction of child target audience ', ' chose to watch this movie because it got great score here on imdb but like many others said that must obviously be fake paying people to vote or just paying to raise the score directly add score on just 1 star to make the average more at level with what the movie deserves around 5 6 stars it does it job of showing super heroes fight with lots of special effects and nothing more you don develop any bond to any character you know exactly what will happen and you know no hero will die if they did die your reaction would just be huh because you didn develop feelings for them anyway ', ' deceived by the praise and high ratings this movie received here decided to watch it even though didn like thor couldn sit through the propaganda that was captain america and thought that both of the ironmen were only average the movie is just fighting explosions destruction to infinity and the action isn anything that you haven seen before there is just more of it which doesn make it better it just makes it become boring and repetitive really fast scattered amongst those are retarded dialogs and stupid one liners seasoned with terrible acting and corny motivational speeches in the vein of god bless america and make the rest of the world or rather universe its colony samuel jackson was unbelievably terrible scarlett johansson was terrible and was that sherlock holmes wearing suit of armor could have sworn that the character was the same only the name was different so much for robert downey versatility the rest of the cast followed suit the only decent actor in this movie was tom hiddleston but his character was ruined by the writers loki is supposed to be god but here he is so mediocre that it is ridiculous his mighty spear is nothing more than very low grade laser gun which doubles as mind control tool that doesn work all of the time and when it does work it does not work all that well the mighty fearsome aliens turn out to be mere cannon fodder dropping like mosquitoes characters level of strength and power changes throughout the movie to suit the need of the moment there are 2 yes two funny scenes and both include the hulk beating up people that should give you an idea about the quality of the funny parts of the movie guess to like this one you would either have to be die hard fan of the avengers or die hard fan of mindless repetitive boring action this movie doesn require suspension of belief to be enjoyed it requires suspension of brain functions ', ' this can be marvel movie it was such an underwhelming meandering lame bore it can possibly be of the same franchise as avengers endgame or iron man just scarlett and florence groaning and moaning about their horrible lost childhood in post soviet russian evil organization ', ' action scenes are reasonably good but nothing memorable fight scenes are little dull characters not fully utilised there quite long dialogue section in the film which felt could have been condensed down didn need to be that long and got little boring d say it a reasonable good film and 6 10 is fair score but then they gender swapped taskmaster don get me wrong women should be empowered and absolutely be equal to men but for the love of god stop swapping genders in bloody films it boring and tedious for that it an immediate loss of 2 points ', ' really good movie with few slow parts but over all it a must see ', ' first of all when you know this movie can affect the main timeline in the mcu you aren excited about this movie so you need great film this is not the case the movie was slow paced pretty boring it a good story but nothing special scarlett johansson character deserved more this is one of the weakest movies of marvel it is still watchable though ', ' the series is breath of fresh air it not flippant but neither is it geekily earnest it moody and dark yet never self indulgent it has strong characterization without resorting to caricature sadly am not qualified to judge whether it stays true to the comic book daredevil is set in the same universe that marvel has developed over the last half decade through various films and tv series including captain america and agent carter it a world where superheroes are very much in the public eye the struggle between various masked men and women has nearly destroyed new york city hell kitchen is purgatory of abandoned buildings infested with drug dealers and pimps the perfect place for budding superhero to ply his trade cox is quite good as matt complicated man burning with rage who occupies gray area he serves the side of the good and the just but he happy to visit crushing violence on his enemies thing is matt has no superpowers and he blind yet he has nurtured his remaining four senses into powerful tools and like the mythical japanese blind swordsman zatoichi he has honed his martial arts skills so perfectly he could kill roomful of sighted people without breaking sweat solid performance from the actors across the board especially charlie cox and vincent onofrio who plays fantastic villain ', ' one final movie where nick fury mac coulson and all gets reunite for mission it not less than avengers ', ' ms marvel is absolutely dreadful the main characters acting is horrendous and not single aspect of the plot is believable it like watching terrible disney kids tv show hey jesse sorry marvel try again with better plot and new cast ', ' first of all great series ve been big fan of the marvel netflix series but guess that not surprise to many however m not here to praise how great the show is that up for you to decide plus ll bet most of you are fed up with the unending positive reviews anyways but rather to give short critique on the quite misleading review here on imdb regarding the dialogue and social norms represented in this show to the current top review who claims that this show is tainted with sjw language let me put this out for you there is nothing and repeat nothing sjw about this show the term sjw has been used so extensively in these past couple of years that people simply use it as substitute for another term without fully understanding what sjw really stands for do you really think and mean think about it that show aestheticizing brutal violence and portraying male dominance excessive masculinity and heterosexual relationships is trying to enforce sjw values remember sjws are trying to subvert the dominant norms and values of ordinary life and it quite clear that this show only reinforces those dominant views of life so to those afraid that they ll be treated with specific scenes or dialogue that will conflict with conventional values don be as they are pretty much nonexistent in this show sure you might think that the female character madani is annoying because she impudent but this is merely typical trope cliche used in tv shows and movies since classical hollywood so no don think that this show is trying to brainwash new generations also don believe that this show is trying to politically correct in any way if anything will commend this show for having very accurate depiction on reality and not twisting it the punisher is overall very gritty show that emphasizes on brutal realistic violence more than in daredevil m not here to criticize that m 19 and honestly love to watch some intense gory fight scenes every now and then but this is just warning to younger audiences that might be watching this most reviews never point this out so felt the need to point this out s this review reflects on my experience with all the episodes don believe it fair when people rate the entire show based on the first one or two episodes there a separate imdb page for each episode for that ', ' now this movie isn bad it just not that good as other marvel films honestly this movie disappointed me whole lot most of this movie is just dialogue as if quentin tarantino directed it the action is very good and the graphics are great but overall it just alright ', ' never thought d be the guy to complain about tv violence but this series of shows is far too violent this is great series with great storyline and could be awesome but it let down by the current netflix trend to make overly violent television programmes it daredevil so might expect that it going to include some violence but every one of this series of shows is incredibly and gratuitously violent don know why this is the current fashion for superhero flavoured shows and films but the dark dystopian violent trend is spoiling many shows that could be so much better and reach wider audience for me it just shows lack of intelligent scriptwriting and misconception on the producers part that they believe this is what the audience wants what the audience want is good story convincing acting occasional relevant violence if it part of the plot and great visuals not the level of sickening violence that is prevelent in these shows don get me wrong m used to screen violence but this new breed of tv show goes way beyond the norm and once upon time would have either been banned or have been given r or rating spoiler for instance there one scene in the show where kingpin smashes guys head in with car door until he decapitated him you don see the guy lose his head but what you do see and hear is more than enough it revolting ', ' best tv show drama in years the fights scenes in this television show are the best in years not much to tell and not to spoil but give 10 for costumes sets and direction and keep up the great work big fan of the cast love you all ', ' great first season ok second and third but great character and very believable and raw bring this back please ', ' will not make this review very long but you can add it to anyone else that gave this 3 out of 10 first of all will say that this film is perhaps the first one for me ever that has warranted obtaining it by pirating it from the internet could not sleep had spent 10 at the theater on it and for that matter 3 00 for one evening rental of it on dvd as downloaded it was really excited mostly just basing it off the reviews and records it set on its opening weekend and through the summer of 2012 even and wow was so wrong in doing that keep in mind know that it holds true to form to comic books and their characters depicted in the movie but have seen iron man captain america and the last two incredible hulk remakes and somehow this grouping of all the marvel characters diminishes the value of all the characters individual films they lead in so much its embarrassing really liked iron man but his one or two liners in this film are not funny but very cheesy and predictable the costumes on some of the characters are laughably ridiculous namely loki his ram looking horns or whatever hawkeye and his blue contacts and then cgi diminishes all of the others looks and finally it speaks enough for itself when this is just one of very few films have ever watched where stopped or paused it every 10 or 20 minutes to go do something else come back couple hours later continue watching only to repeat the same thing again and again it took about day for me to finish it mean that just says something of how dull and dopey this film is at times all the fan boys who may argue out there don please because obviously realize you are fan boy anyone else looking for truly good oscar winning or perhaps classic and one for the history books type of film look elsewhere ', ' should be called the agent may show feminist rubbish where women constantly over power men even less desirable than gods or men with super powers normal women who routinely do that which is highly unlikely in real life to further misandrist doctrine that is ruining our social fabric agent colson is mother figure in this for gods sake agent may is the scary leader of the gang in reality why is in this day and age we have to have this ideology foisted upon us at every turn the reality is normal woman even if highly trained would fall after just one of the heavy punches she takes dozens of in this show the men have to have super powers the women do not this show is little more than sickening indoctrination in the unrealistic self defeating feminist fantasy ', ' call the po po someone stole this movie out from under scarlett johansson david harbour is that man they should be looking for pretty much any good elements that exist in this movie involve him in some way shape or form if not for mr harbour black widow would have been souless mess filled with poor fight scenes and some of the worst banter whinging that have ever had the displeasure of witnessing was really looking forward to this film as an inverted origin story for black widow but it just failed to deliver it seemed more concerned about being triumph for women instead of being good movie ', ' in late scene hulk beats the daylight out of the one credible super villain in the film loki and you realize having team of superheroes even one that spends lot of time bickering does tend to unbalance the scales of justice to the home team the superheroes also include an indestructible beast the aforementioned hulk and an immortal god thor like the old jerry seinfeld line about superman why would he needs the rest of the superfriends he superman why do you need for example hawkeye essentially katniss everdeen with piercing blue eyes or black widow whose superpower seems to be looking good in leather this leaves robert downey jr ironman who by contractual arrangement with the 25m picture actor gets all the good lines two in particular when he calls out an extra for playing galaga and refers to thor as point break are instant film classics unfortunately whedon like the rest of us is slave to rdj ego so he left to give just dull exposition dialog to the boring and largely obsolete captain america there only one god and m pretty sure he doesn dress like that and one note samuel jackson hey you guys we need to fight back having said all that although little talky the film presents expensive looking prolonged and noisy cgi action sequences which distract if not entertain the movie understands its nerdy male audience by lingering on the backsides of the female characters whenever they exit the shot for meaningful but not creepy length of time gweneth paltrow runs with this trope by only achieving ambulatory movement by strutting at all times an excellent cast actor fees only must have hit the 100m mark also contributes to worthwhile outing in short this confused story of overwhelming good versus one overcompensating pasty evil younger brother with bad hair staring at for its 2 1 2 hour run time ', ' movie black widow is beautifully moulded every character is so strong specially scarlet johanson and florence pugh stole the show completely ', ' when we got to know that all of marvels mightiest heroes would unite in this film it had lot of expectations the plot in itself is half decent quite predictable in some parts but also had some intelligent bits found the acting of some characters bit cliche for example chris hemsworth and samuel jackson tom hiddleston has done well in the parts he could shine but there wasn much scope to his evilness he just was evil not saying would ve wanted background story on him but would ve liked some more dimension to his character as always from marvel cgi and action scenes are done very professionally personally also liked the new film score for this movie my rating is 6 10 because story was quite simple for the most part and some characters were little too one dimensional some acting could ve been better ', ' this is the worst marvel series after falcon and the winter soldier marvel please don ruin your image by launching such half baked shows by far loki series was your best wanda vision was also upto mark but this ms marvel is crap ', ' m just being honest here guys am so happy did not go into theaters to watch this if you re telling someone that you are going to watch the new marvel movie what do you expect from the movie excellent cgi effects good and funny dialogue great actors great story soundtrack and 2 5 hour movie that feels like 1 hour movie because you love every second and the time goes by so fast this movie is all of this but in the bad way the dialogue is horrible mean come on what did the writers think when they wrote this was shocked because love the funny but still honest kind of dialogue in marvel movies but in this movie the dialogue was not only just unfunny but it was so cringe that you couldn even believe what they said ve never seen something that bad and am very sorry to say that about marvel movie the story is also really weird wouldn call it bad but personally just didn like it nothing really lead up and everything was kind of not fitting to the rest also felt like they tried too hard to make this women power movie also big bad man who controls many women until they are set free did they want to make this political statement am not sure and did not like it the actors picked for this movie don know maybe it was the dialogue that ruined their honesty for me but am not buying their acting roles music decision was also very cringe they kind of tried to pick music that would ve been in an iron man movie but it just didn fit this movie also felt like it would never end and the most shocking thing is the cgi effects at the end of the movie what the heck are you doing marvel marvel movies always had the best cgi on the market but in the last 10 minutes of this movie jesus christ if you want to know what am talking about just look at the scenes where black widow jumps out of the window and all the scenes where you can see her floating in the air without her face shown the lightning on her suit did the internships do the effects of the last minutes or did you guys drink something never watching this movie again this movie should just be forgotten this is the first marvel movie am not watching second time and ve watched all of them 6 times already because they were so good ', ' till 5th episode it very very boring story is far away from gullible totally childish and worst from marvel it shouldn have been made on first place not single moment where could feel excited to watch it seeing only by skipping everything ', ' this was highly anticipated title for me and may be for everyone else as well but when actually saw this movie don think this movie deserves this type of rating its so much over rated don mean this move is bad the movie is good but so over rated and you will only find kid stuff in there think this one is really made for little kids don watch this movie expecting something like iron man 2 or thor it is not very well written and the plot is not very strong not serious movie think having this type of budged and all the great actors is such waste and believe only the kids have rated it so high if you want to enjoy this movie then do not expect anything like iron man or thor you will be disappointed if you will have those expectations the major issue with this movie is its script and weak plot the antagonist is incredibly cheap and stupid as well they could have used some better ideas although there are lot of special effects and lot of actions which is good but it just do not fits it to an 8 it is an average movie which deserves something 6 10 so don believe the hype thank you khurram saeed ', ' one of the best shows you can watch today really liked the first season but it was the second season that really made me love the show it has great acting great characters and great storyline one of few shows watch that can say is perfect it has great dark gritty feel to it and still can believe it marvel since there is so much violence daredevil is the type of show that just gets better and better the more you watch it even liked the suit daredevil had in the show even though at first was not sure about it daredevil is one of my favorite super heroes ever and this show just does his character perfectly other characters love in the show are foggy everybody loves foggy wilson fisk an great villain and punisher who is my favorite part of the show right now ', ' love the movie and action and the humor haven seen movie in while that made me feel like this ', ' positives 1 the opening sequence and opening credits make the film seem like it was going to be dark and gritty which is what was hoping for 2 the hand to hand combat scenes were very physical and hard hitting which liked the action scenes in general actually are pretty well done 3 was really engaged by the emotional conflict between the four members of the family and their complicated relationships they have with each other and their pasts negatives 1 taskmaster made no sense to me does it ever explain how they are able to perfectly copy everyone else moves also although the identity reveal was surprising found taskmaster far less intimidating after the identity reveal 2 the film suffers from common mcu problem it has very dark themes but they are frequently undermined by the out of place humour and jokes 3 there were elements of the script that felt were quite badly written either through bad scene writing bad dialogue or unnecessary scenes just to extend the runtime ', ' won include any spoilers just want to say that the hate for this movie is completely ridiculous found it to be very entertaining movie loved the build up that lead to carol discovering who she really is just go see it and enjoy it for what it is ', ' even though season two was terrible m giving it high rating because still recommend you watch it my only complaint about season one is that they pull the villains power works on everyone except the main character really don like it when shows do that but especially don like it in this case for two reasons one it doesn make any sense he has made people kill other people in far more gruesome ways than punching them but it never makes them immune to his control there is never any explanation good or bad for why jessica is immune she just is my second reason is the one that is the most annoying though tv shows being dumb isn a new thing so my real complaint is that they didn even need to do it wearing headphones or something like that is cleaver way to avoid being controlled also then you would have killgrave getting more powerful as the good guys get better at countering his powers would have liked it lot more if jessica outsmarted him in way more interesting then just being immune because she is the main character ', ' florence pugh was the highlight of this drab movie the concept was there but the execution was poor if disney went for an 18 rating and good script it could have been amazing ', ' from the rather absurd start to the bcak widow to about 20 mins into the film you don really know what the hell its all about from then on its one impossible action scene after another with largely female kick ass cast ', ' wow normally watch each marvel or superhero tv show at least once am always disappoint they are boring bland predictable action ridiculous dialog and the actors look as if they are simply reading the script on stage void of emotion but keep hoping this is not only the best of marvel superhero tv shows it is one of the best tv shows have watched it is can look away drama and action the characters are realistic and likable even though flawed the cast is perfect love all the moving parts the way real life is story over story overlay ed jessica is one of the best written realistic characters can think of on tv now and possibly ever which is funny because she is superhero hard assed private detective which is not someone the majority of us have ever encountered though constant action and emotion it never seems unrealistically overwrought jessica often says and does the things we wish we were brave enough to say and then get away with this is my new binge watch ', ' by far the worst marvel movie so far am extremely disappointed after the mess that thor 4 was was hoping that marvel learned its lesson but it seems not am honestly happy this movie did bad at the box office that what you get for ruining such great character loved cpt marvel from the comics what makes it bad action moves way too fast from one scene to another no character improvement or growth by the end of the movie things just happen with no storytelling not serious enough too childish for my taste also found two good things eventually these writers should never be hired again ', ' not having watched many superhero themed movies tv shows was really surprised by this one now m 8 episodes in and am truly amazed the 8th episode mostly with the background story made me vote 10 on this show it is very well written and directing is just amazing the acting is credible and characters are well shaped although can really comment on the superhero specifications of the show can assure you that technical stuff of it the writing directing effects and acting are just flawless having it compared to arrow it is much more credible and enjoyable and in my personal opinion it is in every aspect better my vote 9 5 10 ', ' after realese the marvel movie never want to watch the movie but watch the for two reason 1st reason is that marvel all movie are connected the 2nd reason is that love ms marvel am teenager and enjoy the ms marvel serise but want some more interasting marvel movies cannot love the movie but like the movie also problem is that this movie is to much shorts think the best part is kamala khan family comic timeing also love the swiching of theree charecters this is written very funnily overall good watch movie this is one time watch movie but for marvel fan we need more interasting topic ', ' when it started getting easier to make superhero movies because budgets became bigger and visual effects became cheaper it became clear that any superhero movie is horrible by nature and only with good crew and cast would that change the past couple of years haven shown much promise in this area but the avengers shows that with an intelligent and capable director enough good actors actresses limit to the amount of deaths and explosions that there can be and screenplay that at least tries to get away from those nasty clich there can still be savetheworldfromdisastor movie that can entertain with its freshness for all superhero fans from all walks of life as well as for those wishing to discover what superhero film is all about it an all in one bargain ', ' take the time out of your busy schedule and think critically before you judge this movie the floods of trolls and 1 star reviews had their mind made up about this flick before it was even released it just goes to show some adults grow up but never actually mature so put on my big kid pants and actually gave this movie shot and guess what folks the film wasn terrible dare say it was actually very good nothing particularly spectacular or groundbreaking but good nonetheless thought the makeup effects and fight choreography was stellar the movie ran at decent pace was actually engaged in the story and wasn quite sure what was going to happened next marvel managed to another villain with good twist that is actually entertaining and even sympathetic with their plight brie larson does fine job portraying the marvelous captain don understand how people say that brie performance is wooden and compare her to scarjo black widow when there hasn been single memorable or interesting scene of mcu black widow other than her introduction scene in iron man 2 also let be real scarjo has the emotional range of baby wipe the dynamic between fury and danvers is great was surprised how well these two played off each other the friendship between carol and maria was also well done and felt genuine loved the message of how carol humanity is what truly makes her strong thwt how even though we may fall getting back up is what matters the refusal to give up against all odds is where true strength lies solid superhero flick gave it chance and so should you ', ' one of the best any superhero or action flick fan will love this show ', ' theres nothing special here this feels like black panther all over again where somewhat mediocre film is getting undeserved attention because it panders and hopes you wont ask too much of it the story is tried and unoriginal the baseline feel is slow and boring like it all building up to something that never develops if captain marvel is suppose to be this next phase tony stark ll need to see lot more currently wouldnt rate her hawk eye ', ' even though thought ms marvel is the 2nd worst of all the marvel shows only she hulk was worse still think it worth watching it actually gotten great reviews and currently holds 98 on rotten tomatoes the cast is mostly made up of unknown actors and actresses led by iman vellani as kamala khan this is actually her first acting job ever and she does pretty good job she did such good job that her next job is in the next marvel blockbuster the marvels thought this show was only targeted for teens but was wrong while it is definitely aimed more for teens and children that doesn mean adults won enjoy it it a fun show with plenty of heart ', ' completely underwhelming villains were nothing to shout about occasional mild humour don mean to complete slaughter it it wasn terrible just not very engaging save it for rainy day ', ' great show and for those who think it too childish you re watching sci fi series based on comic books ms marvel has everything that makes peter parker and spider man so adored it displays period in life high school that is so influential and relatable not only to teenagers today but to anyone whose ever experienced it for those who are kids it represents struggles they re going through themselves for older people it recalls teenage nostalgia both the cringe and fond memories it a look at pure teenage character going through the same things everyone else does and that what makes it so great the only difference between her and peter parker is that she is woman and she pakistani if you re familiar with the culture there will be some extra references and connection points that will make you love the show even more but if you are unfamiliar you will not be missing any substantive part of the series people who can get past this unfamiliarity will let ignorance and intolerance get in the way of an amazing new character in the mcu ', ' highly recommend this cute show for the family lovely kind female character who is figuring out life the graphics and look of the show are real delight to watch and the music is amazing looking forward to more shows by marvel and other companies which go beyond the narrow cultural context we are all used to seeing ', ' this movie made me cringe so many times could have been great like the 1st capitan marvel really hope the studio can turn it around have loved almost every movie put of regardless of cast or plot line but it seems to me that the studio has lost its way on good story telling or building up to the next great movie think they are under the impression that just because it made by marvel it going to be hit please take look at why this movie failed and promise you will never attempt to make something this awful again would normally give marvel movie pass because the next movie will surely be better but they seem to have lost all connection with the real fan base that made them so successful rip marvel ', ' took off star because it did start slow for me but it really flourished into one of the most fleshed out and nuanced shows of the mcu didn like the initial use of djinn to explain kamala powers but they resolved it really well and in very meaningful way something new and unknown can sometimes unfairly get fearful or menacing label definitely something to resonate with teenage girl who trying to find her place in the world ', ' wanted to like this but found it boring editing was good music choices etc but didn make it past episode 2 this might be ok for tweens teens ', ' really enjoyed this film much more than thought would perfect marvel combination of action heart and comedy some great acting and exciting storyline must match ', ' saw first season and lost interest to see other seasons that series is so boring in whole first season only few minutes are enjoyable ', ' yeah it was great unfortunately not just the way expected the perspective was really off didn make lot of sense ', ' horrible screenplay how was it that nobody checked the writers work before starting who approved the fight scenes what was the logic behind the two sisters reunion part of the movie started writing this review one hour in to the movie is that horrible the only reason am not storming the exit is because am with friends marvel it is time to hire some professional writers and directors isn it and there are many out there ', ' highly enjoyed first part of seasons so far but djinns dont fight like humans with iron chains and thing they have there own special powers great tv show with different culture and powers recommend it to everyone ', ' not since superman with christopher reeve has their been film that captures the true essence of comic book lot of super hero films are just by the number dumb boring cgi fest green lantern for example was real victim of this kind of mindless stupidity in making super hero film when puts all his hard earned experience of years in tv with buffy here he understands how characters work and understands an intelligent plot line my only quibble would be the aping of th transformers movie with the building being destroyed in the end but apart from that this is probably one of the best super heroes ver made well done mr whedon ', ' after many years and many movies black widow one of the original avengers finally got movie and while it wasn anything groundbreaking it was still fun watch taking into consideration the splash of spy genre pack of new and interesting characters plenty of action and intensity d say this wasn a bad movie it something exciting while not totally memorable in the large expanse of the mcu scarlett johansson and florence pugh both did great david harbor character was good and definitely became favorite in the movie but think he still has some things to unravel the ending big reveal was kind of mediocre but the final fight swept it under the rug mostly hopefully we ll get more of some of these characters in the future so they ll have the time they need to grow overall if you haven watched it and want movie to watch while you re bored d recommend this one ', ' the show was kind of bland no real character development exept from the religious and family dynamic and thos are fine by all means its just that thats all thats there and on their own it doesent really hold up but my biggest gripe with it as it is in many other movies and shows is that she gets her powers and shortly after she can use it almost perfectly out of thin air she holds her own against people that have trained for decades with out getting hurt while others way more experienced then her just drop like flies and let me be clear have nothing against the character itself since dont know much about her from the comics its just that who ever wrote and directed this is to blame ', ' the worst marvel disney series is here is so disney and no marvel at all don waste your time with this soooo disapointmed m really try the only good of the series is the music theme thats all ', ' why do these films have so much jargon delivered in mumbles at diarrhoeretic speeds how does anyone understand the film in one sitting at the cinemas ', ' wanted to see this series because of jon and was not disappointed the level of brutality was great netflix did great job on this show it is must watch ', ' will admit black widow is my favorite avenger so was pretty disappointed with this film it took me 2 months to get through it because truthfully couldn watch it in one sitting however really enjoyed florence pughs character yelena and was happy to see her return in the disney hawkeye series sadly you won miss much if you skip this movie ', ' daredevil is marvels best show yet it has different tone the the marvel cinematic universe it is much darker and realistic while still having the marvel identity with great snappy dialog and subtle humor the characters are also one of this shows strong points charlie cox is fantastic as daredevil just as every actor brings heart and value to thief characters the crime element of the show is also another sting point people who are fans of the character daredevil will love this show and people who are unfamiliar with the comic book hero will enjoy the show as crime show this is totally different to the usual marvel movies but is yet one of the best marvel features hope that marvel keeps going in this direction with more serious tone but yet keeps the fun jokes and dialog the show is incredibly violent but as said before keeps its marvel feel this is obviously the best marvel show yet go daredevil m hoping for season 2 ', ' this film is an enormous disappointment and fails for being woke with gratuitous female power and male lead david harbour as the big clown and sidekick hey let make an example of male stupidity in this movie while the overall acting was decent rachel weisz performance was rather lackluster russian accents weren consistently russian the cgi was cringeworthy and the tone was blatantly gender biased there is plenty of unbelievable action and zero latency injury recovery times that mortals for the main characters experience ', ' literally nothing interesting happens the characters are one dimensional and flat and the storyline is vanilla and all things plain ', ' awesome movie great action acting and story line must see on the big screen it not right that people are giving it negative reviews because they won see movie with strong woman lead character what in the world ', ' really really try to like but the writers ruins everything hope revindication in season 3 jessica of season 1 needs to be rescued ', ' in 2008 we were treated to post credits scene at the end of iron man featuring samuel jackson making his first appearance as h e d leader nick fury this small minute long clip confirmed one thing an avengers movie was happening so here we are four years five films and one name change later we have avengers assemble so was it worth the wait in short yes now you think that in film with so many big stars that some of them would end up being sent to the sidelines but every single character gets their moment to shine the only person that does feel little underused is jeremy renner hawkeye but given his role in the story it understandable and he still makes an impact he could certainly give katniss everdeen run for her money the hulk hasn really had much luck when it comes to the big screen currently on his third actor in just under ten years but joss whedon and mark ruffalo have managed to bring the hulk to the big screen in possibly the best way possible and it mostly all down to ruffalo damn good acting he the first actor to portray both banner and the other guy in the same film and that a major benefit to have the hulk actually look like his human counterpart this time whereas the versions from ang lee 2003 hulk and louis leterrier 2008 the incredible hulk were both just big green cgi mess alas there are some downsides to every film and avengers assemble is no exception the opening pre credits scene does feel little unsure and the middle act drags little bit it was entertaining but did find myself wondering how long they were going to spend on the helicarrier before something interesting happened finally arrive at the 3d it wasn particularly that impressive if m honest stopped noticing it after about twenty minutes though that probably proves just how good the film was apart from in select few scenes and even then the screen is too jumbled every time you blink your eyes need to re adjust to the image and it becomes blurry d say that if you have the extra money go for 3d but if you opt for 2d viewing you won miss much and you ll save some money apart from the minor niggles pretty much perfect film ', ' this will let you know how amazing actress scarlett johansson is ', ' if it ain on the page it ain on the stage daredevil represents in my view perhaps the best comic book adaptation done to date and it accomplishes that task spectacularly because it doesn try to be comic book adaptation it is what stan lee himself would often use as description of his writing good yarn the best stories are always about people because that the nature of an engaging story as much as our imaginations love to be titillated by scenic backdrops or engrossed by thrilling action or inspired by courageous acts or engaged by surprising plot twists none of those techniques capture an audience empathy and attention if the characters do not feel real we as audience members want to understand what it feels like to face and overcome insurmountable odds whether it is to reinforce latent desires or to overcome trying circumstances we are desperate for vicarious experiences which expand our view of the world and our view of ourselves we want to know what life can be like when lived through the eyes minds and hearts of others and it is the fulfillment of this essential need which empowers fiction to such degree it pervades our society in the form of storytelling having grown up with comic books as means of escaping my own reality as child had never before encountered such rich depth of character as vincent onofrio embodied in his representation of wilson fisk his remarkable representation of the complexity of man who throughout the first season was an awakening to his own nature as deeply flawed and psychopathic killer fulfilled the promise made by writers who truly represent the best of their craft upon watching the progression of his development throughout the entire first season told as complete story one cannot help but to be both empathetic and repulsed by man who rose to power in the criminal underworld and who was referred to in the comic book version as the kingpin not once was this trite appellation used in this series not that would have minded it because believe it title which does have good sound bite ring to it each of the characters in daredevil has been lovingly rendered as fully fleshed human beings one can empathize with eldon henson was perfect choice to represent matt murdoch convivial partner he not only offered the comic relief series as dark as this one needs to provide an audience with necessary breath of air he and his writers also offered depth of character which elevated foggy nelson beyond the role of simple comic relief was very pleased to see deborah ann woll chosen as karen page because was already impressed with her acting chops as the character jessica hamby from the series true blood the writers also elevated her role far beyond the treatment given her in the comic book world by empowering her with an investigative fighting spirit who rose above the old school feminine stereotype and responded to threats to her person in realistic and life altering manner which was neither oversold nor undermined through diminished gravity initially had difficulty accepting charlie cox as matt murdoch but had already been groomed with decades of perception for who that person is found myself quickly becoming comfortable with charlie as matt and believe he truly did become daredevil to me as the series progressed became attracted to what appear as his likable characteristics in real life and found they softened the brooding matt murdoch from comics in way which increased my empathy charlie cox delivered nuanced performance which speaks to great potential as leading man in his future career as an actor look forward to seeing him in other roles in future of course one cannot speak of daredevil without two of the most interesting and integral characters of the mythology the reporter ben urich and matt teacher stick vondie curtis hall is an actor who has impressed me for years and although his ben urich represents departure from the comic book version loved this representation more than the source scott glenn is an underrated acting legend who effortlessly delivered solid representation of the brazen mentor stick waited the entire season to see the man in costume and the manner which that introduction was delayed added to the suspense while providing insight into how and why someone would dress up in costume to fight crime especially loved the character they chose to be responsible for creating that costume because it gives me something to look forward to in the next season without giving too much away am looking forward to how someone whom daredevil befriended becomes an enemy in the guise of character known in the comic book world as the gladiator look forward to their depiction of technology used to create costume enabling the wearer to punch with spinning saw blades love that production companies like netflix are releasing an entire season at once because believe good story is best experienced not when waiting weeks on end for it to unfold but through binge watching daredevil is story best experienced as binge because it is complete story unto itself which when one allows oneself to become hooked by it one is compelled to finish it up to the end even better daredevil is so rich with subtlety in its writing cinematography along small details and hints of future to come that it will bear re watching my only concern is that they set the bar so high with this first season that am afraid they will have difficulties maintaining this level of quality in subsequent seasons ', ' loved so much about season 1 but even if try to think forgiving thoughts about characters stupidity that sort of just goes on and on seamingly with no lesson learned ever can get over every other stupid reckless and well stupid thing trish does in season 2 3 season one was 9 for me now after 3 my annoyance with the way they wrote trish her actions leave me at 5 but loved season 1 ', ' just tried to watch the series immediately noticed that the makers put more emphasis on religion than on the character m not interested in religion or any other religion if want to look at superheroes they should be neutral m afraid the movie will be bad as well until now have decided not to watch the series and the marveles ', ' many people give the avengers bad reviews because it has too many superheroes but here what they need to realize you don walk into theater to watch the avengers movie that supposed to have multiple superheroes without realizing it supposed to anyway this movie had lot of action good humor and great acting what are people thinking giving this movie bad reviews just because one thing was hokey how loki got out of that place he was stuck in maybe if they saw the post credits scene to thor they wouldn mind as much whatever is running through the heads of the people who rant on this one can think of something that will turn their argument around if not turn it around at least make the argument tie avengers was great movie bottom line ', ' since watched the season 1 in netflix now in disney plus knew that jessica jones will be different to any show ever made by marvel before the way they created the show along melissa rosenberg was phenomenal and so different to other superheroes shows or movies made before krysten ritter and rachael taylor made an awesome performance with her characters all the characters are awesome and deserve their own credit 3 seasons of pure entertainment also is pure psychological tv show that you will love if you like marvel universe or just are looking for good tv serie like said very different comparing with advengers stuff that for sure ', ' take dozen writers and dozen directors keep each in the dark refuse to allow any of them to talk to one another then have an intern collate all the scripts and hand part of the script to each director after each director has shot his or her portion hand those portions to other interns and have them splice it together to make film and try to convince the public that it is unified film it has too many story lines with far too much going on was almost cheering for the villains to win as cared nothing for any of the heroes and yes understand the concept of the flawed marvel hero it dragged more than ru paul and had more holes than swiss cheese could almost predict the dialog and the plot turning points dull dull dull m fan of all of the characters and this film destroyed any greatness that they had it all comes down to script it like building skyscraper on quicksand some of the special effects were cool but that not worth the price of admission ', ' thanks to script that emphasizes its heroes humanity and wealth of superpowered set pieces the avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for marvel at the movies ', ' sympathy to all those who paid to see this virtually total embarrassment to sit through as well as being quite an amazement that it was released for public viewing first up was that it resembled child movie maybe early teenage add few moments reminiscent of any hallmark movie and cast primarily female and you have probably the first syfy chick flick production was as expected in the mcu world but unfortunately the storyline was pretty cringeworthy wouldn recommend enemies to watch it and even more unfortunately is spin off series appears to be in the making worse than thor 3 and ant man 2 if that possible but proof that miracles can happen as describing it as worse is being polite ', ' don give much expectations to this movie then only feel comfort after watching this movie the story of the movie is about the women who are alone in the society without their family such type of women are kidnapped by person who lost his daughter in bomb blast he operate the brains of women and keep micro chip in their brain so that he can control them to do crimes he creates red room think there will be second part for this movie because the movie end in suspence overall great movie ', ' first of all it impossible to watch it until it ends because of how cringe it is the story doesn make any sense at all the acting is bad and let be clear here all actors are acting bad not saying that they are bad actors but in this movie they just are the villain is awful her range is not very well put on screen it unclear her reason behind all of this her story is not established and the actress doesn help too much the vfx and fighting scenes are very poor executed it looks bad mostly no heroine makes you care for her everything is mess in this movie ve honestly never seen such bad movie in long time ', ' it really fun to have look behind the scenes of the mcu it makes you appreciate the whole production even more some of the episodes of assembled are really great and take you through many different parts of the production especially liked when they would theme the episode to match the show or movie itself which they re not doing too often the men 97 episode was nice but was disappointed they focused mainly on the nostalgia aspect and about the history of the show and comics instead of showing us the actual work behind the scenes the redesigns storytelling the animation etc ', ' this movie was pretty boring the action scenes are worse than other marvel movies it was so boring that was looking for something else to do while watching it ', ' seriously do not understand the need for even creating this there are many other deserving marvel heroes where we could have invested our money but this seems futile as if marvel is trying too hard to win the audience genuinely speaking after watching what marvel can serve ms marvel is plain unimpressive giving it 3 stars for the bravery of marvel and teams hard work else is just ', ' ve been waiting at least 10 years for black widow movie and this was complete mess once again they seem to have exhausted themselves with making their social justice moments they had to copy another film to complete the story this time they appear to have copied captain america the winder soldier bit of mess and real shame ', ' florance pugh is sooo amazing all 4 of them are very good on their roles ', ' the story line starts to fall off at the last episode of the first season the later it gets the more confusing it gets every hole in the story stays wide open like the rest of marvel shits there no closure characters act like they have no thoughts on the matter or maybe they re just plain stupid daredevil have phone and he never gets head up of what coming why give him phone then every single time it a same story his friend founds out something and he finds it out at the exact second but the hard way if it was discontinued after first season could give it an 8 but after watching the 2nd there no way in hell ll watch the 3rd if there ever one and definitely staying away from all marvel shits from now on ', ' worst show only the 1st 2 epidodes are watchable episode 5 is the most dreadful one kamala great grandfather talking in enlingh to his wife selectively while seeking freedom from the british is laughable and insultiting ', ' wow was just so disappointed worst marvel movie ever don know if it was the acting or the script but it was worse than ryan reynolds green lantern ', ' am not the target market at all for this but wanted to write review for this show since think it is getting bad wrap for no reason it is lot of fun the environment background graphics alone are fantastic very intricate and interesting it a story of growing up we all did it yes it a story of young muslim girl but honestly it is relatable even to white male from the midwest how many times did all of us dream of having super powers or have something we totally geeked out about that we loved also love that marvel is including characters from different backgrounds in it shows and comics it warms my heart that little girls now have someone to look up to that looks and talks like them ok m done with my rant it fun and funny watch it or don but don get swayed by something because some people say it not cool and too woke find out for yourself and like things because you think their interesting you will live much fuller life ', ' was so excited to watch this movie the first 45 mins was soooo boring this had so much potential disappointed ', ' daredevil is by far the darkest entry into the mcu thus far and not just for gore but for the themes explored by both the heroes and villains throughout the season that right there are no one dimensional villains here each of daredevil antagonists get their own trials challenges dilemmas flashbacks and have plenty of screen time to see it all play out m normally one for lengthy in depth spoilerific reviews but m aware that such length often puts people off reading the whole thing so ll keep this one brief with list of the show main strengths and weaknesses the strengths matt murdock and foggy nelson have an excellent dynamic as college room mates turned partners in law karen page steers clear of tacky love triangle clich leads are chased down from both sides of the law forming entwining parallel narrative arcs matt catholicism is portrayed as an integral part of his character as any faith should be wilson fisk is perhaps the most compelling villain ve ever seen on tv despite his obvious brutality found myself empathising with him at times matt adversaries are comprised of multiple factions each with their own agendas it not just case of hero vs villains the choreography of blind man fighting in hand to hand combat is fascinating thing to watch the pacing is consistently gripping both action and drama are delivered in spades with some major plot twists didn see coming the weaknesses things move bit slowly towards the end of the season some minor threads are left unconcluded presumably leading towards future miniseries all in all very solid 9 10 with only small pacing issues in the last third of the season holding it back from 10 ', ' it was too good from the moment it started can wait for the next episodes it is colorful new set of background for the powers family is typical good to see marvel trying something new ', ' its not been exactly one hour when came out watching this incredible movie was ever excited to watch the movie and with the same excitement m writing of this review for it simply the movie is awesome special effects out of the world justified role distribution and superb script writing and if you think all this little less to mark movie as blockbuster then watch out the star cast robert downey jr can be said as the only super hero who wins fight before starting it with his verbal missiles attack no matter who he is standing before loki thor captain america or the green monster hulk each time he has shown that he is the best actor among all of them although all of the others played their respective superb action pack roles very good story is been good right from the beginning and the movie goes higher and higher in action as well as in story every super hero will give you chance to scream and shout wooooo with applauding your hands generally the main platform of 3d movie is action and avengers justifies on this word you gonna love when the hulk gives knock out punch to an alien monster and of course loki got hell out of beating from hulk of his lifetime in india we call this move dhobhi pachad captain america thor black widow hawk eye loki and fury acted best at all times m lucky as an indian to watch this movie week before it worldwide release as it released week before in india go and watch the movie boom boom boom incredible avengers ', ' lame script and worse characters it looks more like parody of superheroe movies the actors aren the sharpest either bad plot the production is too much for such poor plot the series was made to represent diversity instead of being entertaining totally unnecessary ', ' the series cannot be faulted the characters seem believable and everything is beautifully stylized in the established lines already from the comics so everything is ok ', ' black widow is very emotional and epic movie love this movie its perfect end for natasha romanoff ', ' what disappointment although really not surprised at how bad it was totally boring endless and mostly witless movie aimed at brain deadened people who think that special effects explosions and fantasy but definitely not fantastic characters make for great movie the cinematography was gray and cloudy the editing incomprehensible and the acting unsurprising and depressingly familiar simple human emotions which used to be integral to movie are now so rare noise and all too familiar mayhem have been substituted the attention span of the audience when not being bombarded by yet another special effect shifts quickly to their cell phone when things slow down even bit to think that more of the same will be the order of the day is depressing count me out ', ' confusing messy and rushed is the best way to describe ms marvel the show has two villains and it fails to make either of them look menacing or have enticing intentions the show should ve picked lane with its villains kamala is likeable protagonist to guide as through this journey of nothingness kamala powers fail to look good and it doesn help when character in the show has the exact same power set as her it lazy and frustrating the reveal at the end is fine but it doesn make world of sense the saving grace of its show is its cast and the heart of the show kamala family m looking forward to seeing where this hero goes next but as of now this first outing wasn good ', ' this movie may be good for keeping little kid quiet for an hour and half but that it the animation is awkward the characters are underdeveloped bland and in the case of squirrel girl extremely annoying the villain is nothing that you haven seen million times before and the films moral of being true to trusting yourself is just hammered in with no subtlety whatsoever especially in the last ten minutes it teases possible sequel at the end but hope that never happens it not the worst and think if you have young kids they ll enjoy it but for older marvel fans this is one to stay far away from ', ' this show took me on roller coaster ride at first thought it was solid 8 10 and then as passed the halfway mark felt it was 9 10 and after finishing the show can say it was definitely between 9 10 and 10 10 one thing the show does amazingly well is the development of the main characters and although it starts off confusing it does superb job of building the character jessica jones into someone that you feel like you understand overall the show has very crime investigation feel while also being extremely graphic and raw so you re bound to feel lot of emotions you don normally feel from television but in the end it really makes you fall in love with the characters and must say if nothing else then watch it for the superb acting of david tennant who does an amazing job of portraying his character ', ' spoiler free it a good film there no massive female empowerment message other than the hero is woman in the same way that black panther was empowering people of african decent it a marvel movie and not going to stretch your mental powers too hard it ticks the boxes and you could say it a bit formulaic but as said it a marvel movie the he man women haters are going to hate it but for one enjoyed it 8 5 10 not the best marvel offering but it has high benchmarks to go up against but definitely not the worst haters gonna hate ', ' this was my fav movie back in 2012 one of the fav this is still classic mcu movie to me if compare this to 2017 justice league then avengers 1 wins without doubt for me d strongly recommend you to watch this if you haven already ', ' going into the show had really high hopes but it just wasn good the portrayal of the teenagers feels disney channel esque it overall super cheesy and the plot is unremarkable maybe the audience they were aiming for is kids which would make sense ', ' the movie is ok but storytelling wasn great it fills in some gaps but something is still missing it felt like part of her story was missing even though they did the opening montage and gave us pieces of her story in age of ultron what they should have done was one movie showing her childhood in the red room and her early black widow days then another movie with her meeting clint proving herself to nick fury then this one then it would have felt like her story was done justice ', ' just don get it none of the storyline made sense there was no character development no emotion no anything the entire premise of the movie didn make any sense nick fury character was quite ridiculous but perhaps still better than in secret invasion which guess accounts for the 2 star review instead of 1 any attempts at humor were eye rolling really wished hadn even watched the movie id rather just remember the characters from the previous films instead of associating them with these garbage movies each one really does keep getting worse ve lost all excitement for anything mcu they should just cut their losses and stop making any more of these absurd movies ', ' m glad we finally get to explore natasha character even deeper even though it took longer to get film like this made m glad they took their time because the cast was amazing this was really grounded film florence pugh was the heart of the movie and can wait to see her future in the mcu bravo to everyone who was part of this film ', ' what well executed script perfect cast edward norton couldn make it better and awesome mix of action comedy and humor probably the best villain in movie history loki the awesome one exciting action packed and the usual tony stark believe when people expected the rating to be hah avenger must be 5 what the have to go to theatre and when you watch it and go to theatre it is absolutely as good as they it is loki is very awesome character indeed he completes the movie with his shear charisma the armor he wears is mindblowing the hulk is an essential character as well he completes the comical aspect the black widow this smoking red hot beauty is burst of adrenaline captain america is probably the least noticeable of all thor played really flash in completing the storyline of loki last but not least the rockstar brought to you by ac dc tony stark the witty multi billionaire playboy is the parallel equivalent to bruce wayne what can we say folks this movie could have turned out horribly or at least parly but instead it has surpassed and exceeded everyone expectation real hollywood blockbuster ', ' the plot was humdrum and the acting was predictable do like the spice and variety that florence and t bring though and kept watching because of them think scarlet is absolutely beautiful but she acts like she got chip on her shoulder both her character and herself oh and do like david harbour too but his character was underdeveloped and he was just bit of side entertainment nothing meaningful ', ' between the imdb and netflix ratings you think daredevil was the greatest show in the history of television the positives are that charlie cox seems to play the part of matt murdock very well and it fun seeing deborah ann woll in something post true blood the action sequences are tame yet enjoyable and ultimately more realistic because this isn thor or ironman it a blind guy that can fight thank you marvel for not making this completely ridiculous that being said every episode feels like it 10 to 15 minutes too long and this first season should have been 10 episodes max can count how many pointless and boring conversations have taken place that add nothing to the story fisk henchmen allies owlsley madame gao wesley are possibly the least interesting characters ve ever seen foggy is poorly acted and comes across as annoying rather than endearing the whole production just seems stagnant overall all of these strikes add up and literally struggled to get through this first season wanted to love this show because support netflix and am glad they are coming up with original programming but unfortunately it just not very good ', ' honestly did my best to give this show go but from technical point the show is rushed sceens make no sense the acting itself is horrendous ve seen so many people of this religion presented being unhappy at the show and the acting at times made me cringe so hard wish they had just gone with funny comical and not serious style they sometimes added the comic feel they tryed to do but it is very random and makes no sense when combined with the rest of the show trying to be serious and realistic the cig was horrible and the powers in general are so bright and distracting that it takes away from every fight sceen as it makes them so confusing to follow even though personaly hate strechy characters they should have just done that just strechy ', ' this film is brilliant and the cast are absolutely perfect for their roles it funny and witty and will constantly keep you giggling throughout the movie the action scenes are amazing and executed brilliantly adore all the marvel characters and was very impressed with this movie if you love marvel characters lots of action and hilarious one liners from mr tony stark then this movie is for you the soundtrack is great and the music suits every scene think that the hulk in the film is awesome and the story line is brilliant and doesn get boring or dull the movie will keep you on the edge of your seat whilst laughing your head off at the silly little one liners from the cast ', ' m sure there some level of enjoyment to various members of the mcu fanbase but this movie certainly didn do it for me first of all d like to point out that did actually walk into this film with an open mind ve seen how much hate this film got before it even released and find it so unfair that people have already formed their opinions on film they never gave the chance to view nonetheless watched it without any bias and still didn care for it before get into what didn work for me in this film let me get the good stuff out of the way the action was cool guess and absolutely love iman villani as kamala khan she adapts the ms marvel be always enjoyed in the original comic book series still haven accepted her power changes think it a little disrespectful to the source material regardless iman villani definitely has potential for this character in the future and m excited to see what they do with her with that out of the way what did dislike about this film well for starters there wasn actually any character development in any way and the established team in this film suffers from undeveloped chrome amongst our protagonists captain marvel rarely struggles in fights which is what makes most of the action sequences so underwhelming there was one moment in this film where the villain took character and actually had that person life at stake but apart from that and another character sacrifice towards the end of this film there are little stakes but at least there were actual consequences marvel still suffers with weak special effects and that mainly lies with the cgi portions marvel please let your special effects team finish their work before releasing film know you love quantity over quality but some people would appreciate film with proper visuals can see people enjoying this movie and having good time watching it but this was definitely miss for me personally this film seems to set up some cool ideas for the future of marvel but apart from that this is just another skippable marvel film if you re just looking for good time then think you might enjoy this but as stand alone movie with compelling story to tell then think this is something you might wanna skip marvel seems to have postponed lot of their films to 2025 with the exception of deadpool 3 releasing next year and that may be due to the strike that just ended but still hope that gives special effects team in marvel studios enough time to do there job and make some of their superhero movies visually appealing to the human eyes of course d hope the screenwriters have good story to tell along with those hopefully good visuals ', ' this is great movie the plot is just decent the villains are just alright and some jokes hit better than others but the movie manages to be more than the sum of its parts dark often understated for marvel movie though not the finale for sure and emotionally resonant in the moments where it tries think winter soldier but channelled through amc killing eve the biggest plus by far is florence pugh who manages to bring exactly the type of wild chaotic nonchallant energy to the movie that jodie cormer brings to killing eve villanelle if she is indeed the the successor to romanof black widow then honestly can wait to see her alongside the new and remaining avengers cast ', ' first thing you have to understand is this is not black widow movie it a movie intended to introduce her sister as character to the mcu and that the most dissapointing part because it means no plot no effort in the movie just regular cashgrab as it often the case with marvels projects nowadays black widow as character has no depth in this movie other than making stupid jokes and the villain is just as bad taskmaster is one of the most compelling characters in the villain territory and in this movie it feels like he irrelevant we re talking about movie that doesn care to develop any of it characters in what it black widows farewell to the mcu ', ' they have completely gutted the original characters powers because disney doesn want to acknowledge the inhumans series besides that the writing is annoying and the show is basically disney channel original from 10 years ago its boring and anytime there is any action the camera work is so shaky its dizzying ', ' never expected that marvel create such pathetic series poor actors even flop like farhan poor acting very slow just bad don watch it even you have time to waste ', ' season 1 5 3 10 0 it is common the plot twist is fantastic and the show does really good job in making you believe something and then presenting another but the writing of some characters is bit problematic some vfx shots hurt the eye the action scenes are horrendous and the way they thought about the music is just too lame and say that considering that bear mccreary is terrific composer so while marvellous in some parts agents of h e d does not stand out as very good piece of media for the mcu at least in its first season ', ' went in to this movie with pretty much no expectations and was still disappointed plain and simple this movie is poor was hearing from reviews this movie was gritty and real spoiler alert it not virtually no gripping storyline poor dialogue and desperate cgi action scenes this movie continues to stray me away from interest in the mcu ', ' coming up to the release of black widow was rather unexcited the trailers made the movie look bit boring just your average talk fight talk fight movie boy was wrong black widow is so exciting exilerating funny and really interesting scarlett johanssan probably spelled wrong is great as is david harbour rachel weisz and especially florence pugh black widow ranks high on my list of favourite marvel movies and is definently one of the most memorable black widow is just so much fun ', ' the acting in the movie was great am fluent in russian and my whole family is from there but could barely understand word they said in russian the english as well was just as hard to understand they had strong accents in both of the languages the movie felt very jumpy was confused on what was going on half of the time and my friend fell asleep towards the end the storyline was very random and the editing wasn all that good either haven watched many marvel movies though so maybe m just not grasping something personally was waiting for this movie to be over the whole two hours it felt like chore to watch after my friend bought us tickets since didn want to be rude maybe the character arch and storyline was better understood by other people because they were marvel fans in general and had already memorized some of the names and what the hell was going on but me personally didn get half of the things that were happening having watched only some marvel movies before can say for certain that they were better than this ', ' its probably the most interesting web series for me right now cuz it a full package of action mystery tragedy love all of them combined worth watching ', ' m certainly not the target audience but can exactly give it bad score because it doesn seem objectively bad the characters are pretty charming but there is just too much gen language and humor it also just kinda silly in the first episode the protagonist teenage friend has basically just invented his own version of alexa google assistant and hooked it up to every non smart device at their home it the kind og thing you see in show for children ', ' daredevil might or might not be an acquired taste some people probably just like this sort of show naturally no acquisition needed it not bad once you get past the distracting grunts and groans tennis anyone and the scenes in the dark where you can see anything that has become the fashion it better than the fashion of recent years where actors didn open their mouths and you couldn hear anything foggy is good and imo is the character that saves the show which expect was intended the foggy character seems almost normal by comparison with every other character so it the equivalent of the straight man in comedy if you re looking for some humour to contrast with the dark action blood and gore teary emotion etc go somewhere else it rare still it not bad show and it has it fans who are obvious here the reason gave it this rating isn because while fan of marvel find this particular series not quite aligned with my taste it because some scenes are too drawn out and because overall the series lacks balance update m going to have to put this on hold for bit all the holier than thou scenes blaming random characters for everything instead of the people who are really to blame are bit much to cope with in one sitting ', ' first two seasons of daredevil were great couldn stop watching it then came season 3 they shouldve renamed the show to the wilson fisk show was already tired of this actor by season 3 but they kept him going and going and going just pure lazy with no imagination at all hardly any daredevil in season 3 truly lazy and pathetic ', ' despite the film delay which would have been more interesting if it had been released before infinite war it good the movie brings aspects of natasha life before shield and finally talks about budapest great performances special effects and photography black widow took while to get solo movie but it was worth it ', ' parts of this movie are really good and the overall quality of video and sound design is as always with marvel on point but the story is the biggest problem and where my disappointment with this film lies it feels like the writers realized that halfway through their idea was not working out as the first out feels overly detailed and the second hour feels very rushed with scenes cutting between the different characters and time it often feels like they added scenes as an afterthought to explain some action in the movie what disappoints me the most often got the feeling that the main characters were constantly jumping between coldhearted over natural fighters and then to light hearted maybe even fragile woman with big hearts while booth are okay to use in story the mixture just feels forced and bad m sure that cinema sins will have fun time picking on all the plot holes in total this move has some nice strong scenes especially in empowering female heroes but its story completely disappoints ah sure that the movie would have gotten better reviews if it would not be in the mcu as this means an obvious comparison to the other movies in the mcu and in this regard the movie is disappointing for me as feel like it neither follows up on the characters already established nor the general tone of the mcu this film tries too hard to build its own closed of story and does not pick up any existing story of the mcu had high hopes for this movie and sadly got disappointed tl dr at best average film disappointing for mcu standard 3 10 ', ' have watched thousands of movies but this one this one this one has to be the worst thing ve ever watched sat in the cinema for 2 hours feeling nothing but second hand embarrassment from everyone involved in this mcu filler episode would rather be at work on monday morning or be listening to my mother in law for an entire weekend than watching this again ', ' finally marvel made black widow movie that should have been made about 5 6 years ago the first 20 minutes of the movie was actually pretty good but the rest not so much the third act was complete mess and some of the writing was so weird also they completely wasted taskmaster very disappointing and how can yelena outshine black widow in black widow movie this just feels like more of movie setting up the yelena character in the mcu than actually making good black widow movie just another mediocre marvel movie that could have been better than just meidocre ', ' cannot believe the avengers has received such stellar reviews by 1 3 the way into the film none of the characters draw one in the story is uncompelling and find myself only waiting in boredom for the next fight scenes which turn out to be formulaic and insufficient to warrant further viewing the designs for various scenes and characters also fail they look plastic and cheap and distracting from the story rather than immersive save your time and money and skip this title evidently these reviews have minimum line count which is equivalent to paying by the word so let me be verbose this film was not even fun to watch the villains tearing apart the world because they look so silly in their costumes their character building moments are horribly predictable and shallow and what is up with the designs for loki he looks more samurai than scandinavian god which am sure is tip of the hat to the samurai influence in comic books but let get real for moment he a bloody norse god he should look norse if he going to look so radically different from norse mythology all cybernetic anime then there needs to be some kind of story and character building to explain it ', ' don think this was the vehicle that natasha or scarlett wanted or needed was interested at the beginning but the story just waned and felt that really didn know any more about black widow powers or what motivates her the best thing about this movie is florence pugh as natasha sister she feisty and just lights up the screen liked her in little women which was obviously very different role think this actress will go on to bigger and better things if was scarlett johansson d be feeling quite let down disappointing ', ' think there a story here one of studio interference covid social politics something there has to be reason why this movie exists right it doesn really make any sense we re getting movie about character that well yeah it kind of reminds me of rogue one in way both are movies that don really need to be we don gain anything from their existence they don further the respective stories of their universes in any particularly meaningful way and neither of them has any stakes or anything to them the difference being that quite enjoyed rogue one while it didn further the grand star wars epic felt like it added flavor to those lesser people in the galaxy struggling to make difference black widow doesn do that in the slightest the only thing it serves to do is hit us over the head with some really over the top lessons on sexism lessons which will continue to say are needed but good lord if we could have any sort of subtlety or natural discourse rather than just ramming in these ridiculous forced narratives into things in ways that only ever feel awkward and contrived the woman can be the hero fighting against oppression without making the man into lucifer incarnate and or complete idiot anyhow my rants on political agendas in film aside love that this movie introduces florence pugh to the mcu she amazing and can wait to see more from her either in future marvel properties or elsewhere although am noticing this trend of not loving her movies but consistently loving her in them weird aside from her though there nothing to this its an inconsequential film that will likely be remembered more for the lawsuit around it than the film itself d even go so far as to say unless your huge marvel fan you can skip this one altogether it really brings nothing to the overall experience ', ' with the success of jon favreau iron man in 2008 calls started ringing out across the comic book universe for not only further comic book movies but also for the the holy grail of cinematic superheroes which is also known as an avengers film what followed was four more marvel universe movies the introduction of many favoured and established characters and the continual teasing of fans across the globe with post credit sequences the introduction of samuel jackson as commander nick fury inevitably announced to fans that an avengers movie would come to fruition and it brought forth the key question of when rather than where who and why the man tasked with throwing all these vibrant characters into smouldering cauldron of excitement and pure unadulterated geekiness is one joss whedon he already created three incredibly successful television shows and an incredibly successful tie in movie in serenity but this is undoubtedly his biggest challenge to date today sees the release of the avengers or avengers assemble in the united kingdom across the globe and while it contains evident flaws it nothing short of two hour canonical ride across the marvel universe which provides everything to satisfy fans nerds and casual cinema goers alike buried deep beneath government facility is the mystical cube known as the tesseract when it begins to mysteriously start operating by itself commander nick fury and his agents phil coulson clark gregg and maria hill cobie smulders unexpectedly come face to face with the asgard deity loki tom hiddleston the god is being seemingly controlled by higher being with but one simple yet distinct aim to control enslave and destroy the earth and humanity with reluctance fury initiates the avengers protocol which brings together the rag tag team of superheroes consisting of iron man tony stark robert downey jr the asgard god thor chris hemsworth captain america steve rogers chris evans clint hawkeye barton jeremy renner the black widow natasha romanoff scarlett johansson and the unpredictable dr banner mark ruffalo where the avengers had the ability to fall pretty darn hard was with the amount of material ready at hand joss whedon could ve potentially created ten hour three film epic without even scratching the surface of what drives these beings to do what they do instead in the running time which extends to just over two hours he created an intimate and humanised portrayal of six individuals who may be gods geniuses super human beings and destructive radioactive experiments on the outside but all reflect deep inner trauma on the inside the initial meetings between the characters show an element of distrust and reluctance why should one be subordinate to others when by all accounts in their own minds they all have the better technology powers or intellect with their flaws prominently on show from the beginning whedon doesn just show the audience superheroes but he creates them before your own eyes building these characters from the inside outside he allows the audience to empathise with their plights after all thor is simply an asgardian god with family issues dr banner simply wants to be left alone in isolation to his own devices and black widow and hawkeye seem to battling those basic primal urges that come with humanity and prolonged friendship but one character that does continually feel out of place is the antagonist of the piece loki despite tom hiddleston creating superb maniacal villain with thespian traits who thrives on power and destruction it hard to shake off the fact that loki he is constantly being undermined by those pulling his puppeteering strings yet this should not detract away from his performance which constantly steals the show whenever he is on screen with other members of the avengers initiative and which can be partly attributed to josh whedon and zak penn slick screenplay the script contains some suspect writing in places especially with regards to dr banner and some of the more unusually up beat and intellectually void phrases he spouts but aside from the odd sentence here or there whedon and penn script manages to combine the right mix or humour bravado and arrogance allowing not only each character personality to thrive but also the plot to be continually be driven forward whether it the blossoming relationship between two prominent superheroes or the developing nature of the narrative the film is never stagnant and it this plot development which gives joss whedon the ability to let his comic book geekdom roam free in the final act with an enthralling visual action orientated conclusion starting in manhattan the action takes place on the ground in the air inside buildings and generally anywhere where there an enough room to photograph glorious all battle of good versus evil explosions saturate the air but there also an enjoyable emphasis on hand to hand combat especially when the likes of hawkeye black widow and captain america are left without their weapons beautifully choreographed fast frenetic and aesthetically pleasing the final thirty minutes are fitting and welcome conclusion to an epic comic book movie joss whedon hasn only managed to finally bring the six glorious superheroes to the big screen but he also also managed to do it well very well ', ' am saddened that this movie somehow turned out to be the worst marvel project thus far the story is almost incoherent and the acting was dismal am not convinced that the terrible acting wasn a direct reflection of the terrible story however there is only one redeeming quality lots of cats the cats are fun alien creatures that bring humor to the movie by doing whatever it is that overpowered alien cats will do unfortunately the cgi cats are the best actresses in this movie and the only the saving grace of wasted budget truly would rather watch an entire movie on these cgi cats than suffer through the marvels again ', ' liked kamala in the avengers game liked ms marvel in the comics this show completely dropped the ball as life long community member of redmond washington which has always had huge indian population respect the culture and like it but this show is way too woke and way too borning if disney marvel would spend more passion in actual story character building and writing rather than an obsession with wokeism imagine how great everything would be instead they are collapsing under their own ideology rather than rising up with great characters and story so freaking sad ', ' this is the first time in awhile that ve enjoyed marvel movie in its entirety also liked how it felt long enough but wasn a long marvel movie like the others the marvels ensemble are so good together and part and there plenty of action throughout to see the three of them fight fly and switch bodies which is done very well the movie is fun funny and action packed the story is easy to follow too think even if you haven seen much of the others prior kamala character actress are welcome young energy and her family too the cats are cute the end credits scene is super exciting as well ', ' just below average and let down for the franchise story is predictable and its the same old wine in new bottle stunts were too below average climax is not upto the mark dragging scenes at the beginning the chase at the beginning was the only good part concept of villain is too easy for this story such plotless story only good thing about this movie is that this went for the spark of re opening box office wordwide after the pandemic kudos for that we can clearly see the standard of marvel stories is coming down and dc is improving the same ', ' am relatively new convert to the world of marvel did not grow up reading comic books or knowing anytnig about these iconic characters my experience with marvel began in 2008 when first saw iron man in theaters and fell in love with it was blown away by the level of storytelling and especially by robert downey jr phenomenal performance as tony stark that movie shaped my idea of what storytelling and what movies could be kind of put that movie in the back of my mind for two years but when iron man 2 released in 2010 truly began my love of superhero movies over the next two years immersed myself in the marvel universe have been blown away by iron man 2 thor and captain america the first avenger all of those movies have been fantastic as stand alone movies but joss wheadon the man who gave us the tv adaptation of buffy the vanpire slayer firefly and it follow up sernity somehow finds way to bring all these standalone characters and the elements of the past movies in the marvel universe and combines them perfectly together to make something wholly original intelligent and extremely breathtaking after loki tom hiddelston comes to earth from the otherworldly kingdom of asguard and decides that these new people and this new planet nick fury samuel jackson the leader of government agency called h e d is forced to bring together the world most powerful superheros tony stark iron man robert downey jr steve rogers captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth and dr bruce banner the incredible hulk mark ruffalo together in order to combat his menace along with h e d agents natasah romanov black widow scarlett johannsen and clint barton hawkeye jermey renner the heroes must battle loki army what makes this movie great is the fact that the avengers don get along well at all when they first meet captain america and iron man take an immediate dislike to one another and no one seems to like thor as he disagrees with cap and iron man on just about everything these confrontations make for some of the funniest scenes in the movie this is deeper more philosophical and mature super hero movie while still being an entertaining fun popcorn movie while still being the best superrhero movie of all time this is more than just an action adventure popcorn movie this is every sense of the term masterpiece of filmmaking would say that this movie is worth seeing if you ve seen any of the other marbel films or even if you ve never seen the movies wheadon does damn good job filling in all the blanks of the past movies perfectly for those who haven seen them either way see this movie see it in 3d if possible ', ' the movie is remembered for being joke and amongst the very worst movies disney ever released and there a reason for that with three protagonists whom most viewers will know little to nothing about since two were introduced in streaming series that fell flat and the other had an already hated movie as her introduction in what feels like decades ago the thematic dissonance is heavy is it silly comedy is it brainless action piece all we know is that it irrelevant poorly acted poorly directed and extremely forgettable as brie larson said herself does anyone really want me to return to the mcu well clearly not ', ' my expectations were low before heard it was good movie sure was disappointed there is no investment in the villain and the writing was pretty lazy ', ' just watched the first two episodes on netflix very impressed most super hero stories involve maximum amount of thumping and banging this story about heroine versus an evil mind controller is different our protagonist is frightened young woman who was victim of the mind controller she escaped after injuring him he wants revenge let the mind games begin as our heroine turns and pursues the bad guy krysten ritter has presence as the heroine beleaguered and traumatized she isolates herself by being abusive and abrasive can she forgive herself can she ever find comfort from warm relationship with others dare she recruit allies the series looks promising as our protagonist proceeds with brain and brawn so far the cast has been convincing pacing has been excellent as the show explores the emotional state of our heroine bravo ', ' really loved the black widow first half pulled of tremendously when it comes to final totally left with the disappointment ', ' it is not worth it of from what have seen so far too many things that do not make sense and just plain stupid inconsistency and bad ideas are in full action here bad decision from marvel and disney to make this show the way they decided to do ruined the character ms marvel for me ', ' everything just don add up correctly is like disney type hero wannabe show not mcu storyline depths series is like asking eddie murphy to play sam wilson ', ' hulk smash the avenger is one of the best superhero and best films ever one of the first countries to watch an early screening of the most anticipated films of this year is great great experienced this film has great actions acceptable comedy especially stark and hulk yeah hulk and serious emotions all the actors did great job portraying their role and the visual effects are amazing my favorite character in this movie is hulk mean hate him in the other movies but in this film whoa he great he strong and heavy funny when he smash thor and black widow whoa she not only hot but she also dangerous well overall it was an amazing experience wanna see it again ll rate it 8 5 over 10 assemble ', ' just love it everything about it guess it is my favorite marvel character he has the qualities we all look for in hero and the script is not cheesy not very clich yes there are many different similar stories but in my opinion daredevil stands out it a shame it will be cut ', ' even if you are watching this not for defenders or other connected series still this connects and represents the heroism very well and the character if matt murdock is fabulously adopted and shown this kind of supes will make your experience better his house his love life his history and villain everything is at its best and villain wilson fisk wooohh the attitude style and perfection will never make you regret of watching this and the costume of daredevil since the episode 1 to the end is something different and makes the series more better over time ', ' the problem with most these comics is that they were read by the kids and now they think they will be interesting to adults by adding some really explicit blood scenes this in fact is general trend these days instead of coming up with captivating story throw lots of blood and gory scenes around and hope it will make it shocking and worth watching it is exactly the opposite my wife cannot watch most of the recent series because of this can just about stand them also there are lengthy moral dialogue scenes sometimes several times in each episode which become really boring after the second or third time if you want to make cake you need to break some eggs full stop if you can go do something else there are loads of inconsistencies some really ridiculous like being able to avoid bullets but getting caught by everything dex throws at him but then again catches them at unexpected times the other one is the ninjas being invisible can understand them reducing their hart rate at rest but not while running around and fighting also when they move whatever the cloth they are wearing will make noise ', ' absolutely one of the very best films have ever seen acting directing script were all top notch well made to perfection and this is what all the comic book fans have been waiting on for years comic brought to life how it should be done in tradition of marvel comics brilliant film making the avengers is without doubt action packed but it is also funny clever and serious with innovative cinematography and art direction but its shame award members will not recognize the film for its movie greatness with best picture nomination maybe some technical categories that it other than that trust me and go see it you won regret it even the non superhero fans will enjoy it ', ' it fell short of my expectations is an understatement got 20 min into it and could not go further thought thor love and thunder was disaster until the marvels demonstrated that there is still room to go down the future for marvel does not look good they need to change course and reconnect with the audience am not sure who the targeted audience is but it sure isn the fanbase that earned them billions it seems that money is no issue for them since they can afford to produce this kind of entertainment the direction they are heading is going to drive the fans away sad sad ', ' was enjoying it until jessica started abducting children from outside her country writers from the us really need to start learning that their countries laws do not apply and should not be applied elsewhere decent performances fine story 100 for the exceptionalism and arrogant writing ', ' ve always been fan of superheroes hulk being my all time favorite this movie made my life long reading of comic books come to life it has few laughs lots of action even little romance this movie has it all after coming out of the imax screening was talking about this movie for months and even years later m excited to see what next for the franchise marvel hasn let me down thank you for making my child hood dreams reality ', ' the plot took way too long to get going and once it got started was like every super hero movie that has come out in the past 10 years very boring for the first 2 3 of the movie the support cast was joke no need for some of the characters because they took away from the movie pro once the villian came along finally the action scenes were pretty solid each avenger had critical role in the action and no one character seemed to take on more than the others the second avengers trailer is going to have to look amazing or else ll be skipping out on it ', ' movie that has idea and enough characters with some flair but the plot gets in the way bit ', ' two minutes and eleven seconds is the exact amount of time did not need to realize that it was not worth spending more on following this series and because the 2003 movie is not great as well am bound to wait for proper reboot on the silver screen ', ' black widow was very highly anticipated until it turns out being soulless spin off outta mcu for fun blockbuster from marvel it shows important less scenes literally in almost every aspect of the show from the partially broken family to the villain plot is derailed yet pointless that you will leave the seat whether the end credit scene is important or not ', ' watching this show was like wasting my time watched first episode and couldn have any energy left for watching 2nd episode ', ' the movie did really well story development brie did great job filling the role of super hero and she acted very well of course the movie will be pushed towards the women empowerment agenda but look past that the movie was done very well the story was well written and allot of other marvel references did fit in well and the 90 era music setting timeline were spot on ', ' don know why this show was advertised as the tv version of young adult novel it not it kid accessible but is still an entertaining and interesting show for adults just want to take few minutes to acknowledge everything that this show does well which is lot representation is hot topic with many writers struggling to find proper footing when featuring cultures unfamiliar to western audiences for all those writers and all their critics who complain of forced diversity look no further the show heavily features pakistani culture muslim traditions and the story is almost exclusively moved forwards by women there wasn a single moment in the show when things felt preachy or disrespectful either to the groups featured or to outsiders unfamiliar with these cultures it just was characters are portrayed as fully realized human beings who exist within these cultures not as vessels whipped up at writer table to drag new demographics kicking and screaming into their viewership the actual content of the show is solid too it didn break new ground in terms of superhero origins stories but don think it needed to telling grounded human tale of young girl with big dreams is wonderful departure from the all powerful multiverse wizards and witches we ve come to expect in the mcu ms marvel foregoes spectacle for humanity and it does so beautifully this show probably won be home run for everyone but it good and it should serve as the template for how to achieve representation going forward everyone who worked on this show should be very proud of themselves can wait to see more of iman vellani as kamala khan in the future ', ' this movie is kinda pointless and not that enjoyable if you are marvel fan don watch the movie just look up the post credit scene on youtube or something ', ' started out quite well but have to say that soon the characters all appear weak save the villain and very very whiny the film is not subtle in promoting its social liberal political views which would have been fine if it were just bit more subtle that said the series is easy to watch and as its marvel you continue to watch hoping the acting is average save for the villain who is very good the music average the special effects are average and the script is average if you have nothing better to do might as well spend your evening watching this that is if you haven watched house of cards or any other series which is better than average ', ' really enjoyed watching this show read the comic but thoroughly feel like the first episode was more entertaining that said iman vellani shines through showing that she really loves what she doing and is actually fan of the source material the show is visually impressive with all of the art and animation going on around it love that there is life to everything around the characters making the environment of jersey city as another character this is very spider man ish whereas new york is character to him to the grown up haters say guess you guys aren ready for that yet but your kids are gonna love it ', ' just finished watching season 2 and it great nb if all you want from your superheroes is smash and grab all action stuff then this not for you jessica is real human being with real emotions and problems and the show is largely about how she overcomes and deals with issues at all levels this season seemed to have an uncertain start fact eluded to by many reviewers but stick with it as it becomes much more thought the final episode was explosively good and left us with magnificently worked sad happy ending with doors opening closing for most of the main characters simultaneously sets up 3rd season superbly hope there is one come on netflix let us know deliberately avoided spoilers hence the shortish review ', ' wow was expecting cool origin story and interesting development but don e fooled like was this is just another disney channel show think icarly or hannah montana pretty much the exact same production value and acting levels except we don have to endure cringe live studio audience laugh track or the awwws and oooooohs liked the avengers video game where you start playing as ms marvel and thought that would have been an awesome direction to go with but omg did they swing and miss with this heap do yourselves favor and spare yourself from single episode that is unless you are preteen and this kin of thing is your jam do not expect the mcu features that resemble loki falcon and winter soldier wandavision etc or you will be sorely disappointed like ', ' didn care for season 2 trish got even more annoying so did jessica ', ' enjoyed the film what can we expect from marvel movie not much especially from the black widow which she is not an avenger with very strong character the story is acceptable and enjoyable really didn expect much from this film ', ' it felt like retelling of green lantern the story was bland they made nick fury look like buffoon the only good thing about it was the soundtrack which wasn guardians of the galaxy but it was at least decent and the virtue signaling was so on the nose throughout the movie that it was laughable the most obvious example of this being where guy asks her to smile for him being used as retort to all the people who had complaints about the first trailer saying that she had no emotion on her face whatsoever in every shot ', ' how many times will hollywood just slap film together and shoot it out to fans who hope beyond hope that the film will be worth watching the marcels prove that the answer is once more the people of hollywood and whoever is responsible for watching and then putting this movie out should be fired from their positions start with the obvious poor acting from the lady that plus captain marvel poor acting from the child playing one of the other characters and also poor acting from the other leading lady next plot was there one did it flow did it make sense no no no will never attend another superhero film again and will find it quite difficult to attend any film produced by hollywood since it has been quite awhile since hollywood has put out anything worth watching luckily we still have foreign films from india and other places this is my call to hollywood to change the cookie cutters and try to release some films with originality ', ' was completely ready to like this show jon bernthal was amazing as the punisher in season 2 of daredevil this show is slow and boring and spends too much time on characters that no one cares about even the few brutal action moments that come way to few and far between can make up for how much of slog the rest of the show is this is the last nail in the coffin for my hopes for marvel netflix tv series beyond daredevil ', ' there may be some slower moments every now and then but would argue that there isn a single episode that bad throughout the entire series hopefully marvel studios can give more attention and appreciate for this series in the future it definitely deserves it ', ' this is one of the very few times have walked out of theater with feeling of wow ', ' this movie was lot of fun to watch never seen the captain america or thor movies before so there so what knew to me liked the fact we had some time with each different superheros before come together really liked how the movie flowed it not no stop action all way thought there were calmer scenes in this movie that found interesting and they didn drag on to long to make boring but action sequencing was outstanding first time have actually liked new hulk was huge huge fan of old hulk have never given this hulk chance not fan thor thought can seem to be warn may need to see his movie next see more his back story same for captain america those actions were edge of your seat stuff and lots of stuff going on at the same time hoping for better ending then this movie got they all go on there separate way for the own sequels lol looking forward to sequel wonder if they add other superheros in the mix 8 10 ', ' amazing would be one word review for this movie went on to the cinema yesterday and was excited enough to have watched the trailers more than 30 to 40 times and was thinking how would marvel joss whedon contain any of these characters in such short story last for about 142 min when each of them were brilliant enough to grip me in 130 150 minutes of their own in iron man 1 2 thor captain america but mr whedon knew what he wanted from the story and has clearly demarcated his territory this has to be the best superhero movie till date robert downey jr iron man stark has been ecstatic in his own witty and superb dialogue delivery chris hemsworth thor is well strong and manly chris evans captain america has acted like true captain specially at the latter part of the movie and between all the action and surprise hulk has smashed everything and has been fun too for delightful change really think mark ruffalo the hulk is the key ingredient which would make people jump on their seats and has added to the fun and excitement to this amazing roller coaster of movie delightfully give this 10 out of 10 hope there was 11 possible for allowing me to witness 2 and half hour roller coaster without break watch it if you want to know how superhero movies should be ', ' season one who the heck is jessica jones asked not knowing that was before her time luke cage didn make the biggest of showings in civil war and that was more of stark cap thing and didn remember her from heroes for hire and she seems like she would be part of that and who cares they did it right just reviewed supergirl and sort of made big deal about how they failed to make female super hero anything but well super powered version of bettie and veronica jessica jones ignores all of that she is the hottie that could kick your butt across the room she makes arrow sort of look like momma boy this is made doubly awesome by how much of wimp the big bad is in comparison if he didn have his power there is no way he stand chance against her sophisticated super power versus old school tough she has power of her own but seems like the kind of woman what really doesn need it to get by and it works because netflix is giving us the mcu close to the streets and that is just too cool for school season two so gave season 1 10 stars because it was awesome m giving season 2 single star because well it was horrible so m lowering it to 5 over all and not watching on if it goes to 3rd season the difference between the two seasons is staggering season 1 had brilliant contrast between wimp villain that dresses like dandy and packs truly ominous and sleazy super power and grungy tough as nails hero that could clearly take him in real life if neither of them had powers it was fantastic and the story that wrapped around the two characters was amazing compelling and fun season 2 is the exact opposite it was almost like they had forgotten that they were telling stories in it they forgot that the hero is defined by the villain by the threat the villain poses and the struggles they have to overcome to be victorious and this villain stinks without great villain preferably one that so brilliantly contrasts the hero the hero doesn seem as heroic and when as in season 2 the focus stops being on the story the struggle the drama the characters and starts being nothing more than signal for political virtue well you aren telling story at all at that point and season 2 wasn even trying to tell story it certainly had something to say it loudly proclaimed that it had politics and you should agree with its politics but that isn a story that is statement agree with the politics or not that is just statement and not story so season 1 had great story and great characters and season 2 stated the political leanings of the creators and totally forgot that it was supposed to tell compelling story conclusion in all honesty you really should watch season one it is fantastic it is compelling it is fun season one is great story with great characters season two you can pass on safe and comfortable with the knoweldge that you aren missing anything and the story essentially stops at the end of season 1 ', ' the first half of black widow is an interesting spy drama with focus on natasha mental state after civil war the second half of the movie on the other hand is just another bland formulaic yet entertaining marvel movie with weak villain and weak resolution to natasha moral conflict throughout the film ', ' my first review just try to judge it as it is please forgive my poor english love film that keeps give you sign when something is going to happen this movie did well on that point she present herself good enough she is not wonder woman emotional part of her character states well at point still comes with some confusion in decision action but not to the level of incomprehensible she is powerful the film present that point lot but not sure because this is the first film that we need to be bit holding back the actions or we have many comparison other dcu mcu films prior the presentation was not up to the level expected nick fury plays very good team with capt marvel 90s references give this movie lot of nostalgic point had good time also cat was so cute might be the best part of this movie overall main casts did their job well but other sub characters are forgettable threats are not that lethal but guess its was set up for the later the last post credit movie will made you question your whole life think the studio braves enough to play it simple in the middle of their bests and worsts it is definitely not 1 10 not 10 10 but an ok enjoyable film ', ' seriously this show is fun childish romp so far and m loving it the style for the visual effects is fun and reminds me of scott pilgrim vs the world the characters are amusing and m excited to see the story unfold my only real complaint is that dislike how they changed the source of her powers get that the inhumans tv show failed but that doesn mean you have to do away with the concept ', ' if you honestly love one of those heroes hulk captain america iron man or thor this movie is will be pleasure for you however if you want to see the avengers because of thrilling special effects or tense action you will be disappointed first 2 3 of the movie is constant talking and staring at each other followed with clich super hero type lines and couple of fights between each other if not downey iron man and his sense of humor it would be pure pain don know if it was because of too salty popcorns or because of lack of action on the screen but after an hour of watching it became really really bored d bet on the latter however the last 1 5 of the avengers is the battle in nyc fight scenes humour and cg looks pretty good however there is slight feeling that everything was just too easy in any way you shouldn search for logic in these type of movies there isn any bottom line good for fans average for everyone else but 8 7 you have to be kidding ', ' this movie has been long time coming as it had its beginning in the 2008 film iron man there would also be the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor and finally captain america all these parts left some wondering could they have this many superheroes in film and it not turn out jumbled mess never wondered that as all one had to do was look at the men films and see that for the most part those films got it right the main difference here was that different companies were involved so there may be some trouble however what we got was film that brought team of superheroes together and totally cranked up the action to the max yes have to say the action in this film is better than any action in other comic book films it is not even close they gave me here what have been wanting do not get me wrong the batman movies are still great also enjoyed the spider man and men films but this one just said this is comic book film and people want to see an epic battle maybe even more than one so no good but relatively short fights like those found in most comic book films we get lots of action and an epic finale my favorite character on the avengers is the hulk which explains why did enjoy this film good deal he was finally done right granted the incredible hulk was good too but this was the best representation of the hulk easily he was presented as the strongest by far though nearly gasped when he and thor faced off as never saw that in the trailers so that was nice treat for me and he did to thor just what wanted him to punch him through something granted thor got some good hits in too but loved how they made it clear hulk is the strongest one mark ruffalo was also an improvement over eric bana and edward norton he played banner in bit more nervous and skittish manner unlike say norton who looked capable of putting up fight without even becoming the hulk hulk also got the biggest laugh in the theater was in so this film was everything was hoping for and more the rest of the cast was good too as loki has come to earth to capture the power of the cosmic cube though he has someone behind him calling the shots he plans of bringing an alien force to earth so that he may become its king he does this for no other reason than to irritate his brother thor it seems he is still the same loki from thor as you still do not know what he has going on in his mind was afraid he would not have this aspect in this film but they were able to keep it his alien force is great and this makes for the great finale the finale has the avengers assembling and working together to stop the invasion and it is grand spectacle to behold so loved seeing the heroes utilize their skills and powers and every hero gets in some good hits black widow and hawkeye are expanded on in this film and they are pretty cool if were to have complaint it would be that there was one hero they under utilized bit in film with so many heroes guess it is to be expected was just surprised it was captain america he just did not play as big role in the final fight as would of liked sure he gave some orders but his contribution to ending the assault was giving the black widow boost however he was used well in the other scenes he was in this is not major gripe mind you just if can find something to complain about it is this so in conclusion was impressed and loved this film it was great to see this band of heroes slowly unite as it was watching samuel jackson as nick fury pulling the strings to get them to work together surprised he was listed last in the credit sequence at the end because he played the most significant role in the film and was in it from the beginning to the end the way it is performing at the box office also makes me think there is going to be sequel for sure and that makes me ecstatic as they show who was calling all the shots and suffice to say was not entirely sure who he was until he smiled and then am like oh my god yes see this dc and warner bros if multiple companies can come together and make an epic superhero team film then you can make justice league movie ', ' watched because felt the scathing reviews had to be exaggerated and no movie could be this bad boy was wrong brie larson looks like she would prefer to be anywhere else than acting in this stinker think the other actors believe they are making decent movie so pity them when they watched the final cut imagine they were working out how to distance themselves as quickly as possible the plot is shambolic mess and is no clearer on second watching although to be fair failed to finish the second viewing as just couldn stomach it the action is purely special affects and there is nothing special about them overall am disappointed for brie as thought she maybe could turn the captain marvel character into watchable series but this movie pretty much ends that assume the director will get lot of the blame for the end result but maybe the blame needs to spread further as this continues the trend of destroying the marvel franchise ', ' total wasted opportunity not really sure what they aimed to do here feels like cheap aimless movie when she had such big potential to explore her background story felt dumb and awkwardly told feel like they owed lot more to this character and actress ', ' the 3d effects in the movie were second to none but the story consisted of mainly just conflict after conflict there was nothing truly intelligent about the plot or any of the twists it is worth watching to see the effects especially iron man flying around they did great job of making you feel like you were in the action m disappointed with the imdb rating and feel that the studios are now finding ways to game the ratings system by adding bunch of paid propaganda imdb used to be my go to site but with how high this movie is rated feel need to find another site that is more accurate imdb used to be spot on but obviously they are selling out for ad revenue ', ' in my oppinion they should have gone with the spy theme in the entire movie instead of turning it into cgi avengers movie in the end ', ' dont expect much from marvel movies just want to be entertained am ok with plots that start to unravel if you think about them little bit and with stories that are easily predictable but this one is just boring and uninspired and feels like all of it has been done before by the way dont understand the praise for pugh all the actors were fine no problems there but she didnt stand out and she doesnt really have superhero physique ', ' this show is not good worst marvel creation since captain marvel acting is bad story is horrendous and it just not entertaining after 2 attempts at posting review ll just leave it there ', ' this show started off really strong creatively with cool live animations complementing the show as the show progressed the creativity dwindled not horrible not great guess it ok filler still worth watching ', ' the movie felt kind of empty like it felt short and lacked plot ', ' best best best best best best best best

movie below average mcu movie ', ' this is it folks the lowest point marvel studios has ever sunk to and after the last 3 years that is really saying something this is truly bottom of the barrel stuff went into this film with an open mind despite not being particularly attached to any of these heroes but it a total mess it borderline incoherent and appears to have been haphazardly stitched together in the editing room like some sort of frankenstein monster and it shows brie larson looks bored and uninterested for much of the film and teyonah parris plays character nobody cares about like she knows it the one bright spark is iman vellani who looks like she genuinely having fun and it shows in her performance haven seen the ms marvel show but might actually give it watch now probably not though it sad to see what the mcu has become muddled directionless mess with bad cgi taking the place of good screenplays tight and clever writing and likeable characters that you actually care about where do they go from here who knows but would give this swerve if were you ', ' as someone who grew up obsessed with everything marvel it was kind of tender to see character that reminded me so much of my teen self everything cringe us marvel kids did is there and is both amazing to see and embarrassing to remember it is colorful and bright just like the mind of our main character so it suits her m not huge fan of the changes they made from the comics but the spirit of the character is there ', ' there was some great moments every now and then but the story ended up being very weak as well as the villain and it really is shame considering how long marvel had to get it right ', ' season one was not too bad but season 2 just seems to be plot designed to slip in as much social justice warrior culture as possible jessica has always been hard character to like but that was the character she was supposed to be but season 2 is just boring and chasing the same sjw garbage that supergirl is spewing out each week pity really had little bit of potential ', ' usually huge fan of marvel universe seen all movies with my daughter and when she dragged me through the follow up series was quite sceptical but even thoose liked very much the first hour fell asleep not once but 3 times and still at the reuion as felt the movieplot picked up little but then was so dissapointed in the acting between the family members and general acting the movie had great potential in good story but drowns in gimmicks cgi action not the good kind and generally bad acting it does get better but having to wait 1 5 hours before feeling af connection to any1 character is just too long dont waste time on this 2 hours of my life will never get back ', ' to me it is like watching someone else home movies for about 85 percent of an episode then something happens kamala is the most interesting character but super slow story line and dull characters her hs friend was good character too but not involved much around her make this good show to put on if you need something to fall asleep to ', ' the best series ve ever watched after daredevil the action scenes were just on another level and the story was amazing as well also jon bernthal and the rest of the cast did an amazing job with their roles ', ' this movie is just all over the place well first of all the movie didn feel like black widow more like family of widow when watching movie you can sometimes tell how it going to play out the mcu trope is definitely the one you can see in mile away but it works when they have good story and black widow doesn have one especially when the characters they give you you don care about there so many flaws in the movie and it surprising that they still greenlit this one it more of fan service but other than that the film is whatever the villain is surprisingly bad and the way they tried to make the character connect within the story is just lazy writing there goes villain taskmaster that was anticipating to see just turn to lame sheet paper written character right next to other villains that mcu didn do justice throughout the film you get bit of both which some might call it story and action but it layered with bad pacing and editing to which you don care much of what is happening there a point in the movie that the filmmakers try to give you glimpse of the family reunion by doing catch up and making you understand more so of who these characters are trying to give you emotional feeling but it sure does go on for little too long which makes the scene overwhelming finally some of the action sequences are too wonky which is mainly the editing that makes it feel out of place although there a specific scene that enjoyed was when black widow and taskmaster first fought which is surprisingly baffling that they gave you these other action sequences that are too crappy the best part is the after credits which showcase what going to happen in the following mcu story giving it full circle other than that the movie falls flat becoming abysmal ', ' watched with my daughter and wasn expecting to be interested but was very surprised how much ended up enjoying the program think we can safely say that this series is being review bombed by some really pathetic people who think representation is taking something away from their extremely privileged life mean imagine the audacity in making series that has brown people from another religion as the main characters what next taking our guns away from us it political correctness gone mad ignore the haters and enjoy the show folks ', ' this is character who deserved better than what she got for solo film knew we were in trouble when the opening credits had an ambien induced cover of smells like teen spirit the tone is all over the place and doesn feel like cohesive story it jumps between cringey comedy to downer drama like pieces from different movies were sewn together black widow deserves better ', ' subscribed to disney plus just to watch this boring series so far nothing is interesting im watching because it is marvel definitely not for the marvel fans this should be in disney junior ', ' one of the worst series have watched can continue watching after 1st episode one of the worst series have watched can continue watching after 1st episode one of the worst series have watched can continue watching after 1st episode ', ' jessica jones had great season 1 the casting was good the atmosphere intriguing the script and storyline well written and unfolding and the vibe right with the presence of brilliant villain as whiny as jessica jones was it was bearable all to the credit of the very good writing acting cinematography and soundtrack of that season unfortunately that was the end of its greatness because as season 2 unfolded it became clear that with that lazy writing and script it won have half of the glory of its season 1 it dragged miserably and uninterestingly for 13 episodes and crushed all the good stuff that was the essence of the season 1 then they decided to make third season they learned nothing of their mistakes made in the past season had the horrible idea to put trish in the foreground with her crazy acting story and horrid lines put in fillers after fillers dragged it again for 13 episodes as was the standard and finished it even more horribly than season 2 that was the case of jessica jones in its span of 3 seasons an utter disappointment that m sure the writers and producers learned nothing of fortunately and exceptionally fate came to our rescue when it was cancelled having had tons of money wasted if you look at the broad picture and left almost all viewers unsatisfied and hungry for more this series had so much potential to realize had it been in the right hands ', ' it really hurts me to say that really hated that movie from the start they demolished everything mcu out of it and left only political crap every single action character is female m female and want to see both males and females as soon as the russo aren in charge of the movie it look as horrible as wonder woman 84 when director and production companies will get it through their brains we are people don want to watch political crap we just want to watch and enjoy old good action how much longer they will be producing this awful crap it just waste of money and resources maybe it disney ideas but please stop make this garbage shame on you for turning the stan lee creation into politics ', ' so agent coulson and agent of shields agent sitwell are in diner discussing general ross we have 2 minute chat followed by some stock footage featuring ross stark and the credits role this is marvel one shot it serves no purpose where is the entertainment value in this these shorts are supposed to be tiny stories there is no story here whatsoever the casts performances save it to an extent but what the hell was that meant to be and furthermore how did this cost half million dollars to make it less than 3 minutes long and is two people chatting already paid for stock footage beyond belief can only assume their catering was the stuff of legends one for marvel obsessives and nobody else the good strong performances as always the bad what was that even meant to be things learnt from this movie they wanted arrogant and abrasive yet they didn call me weird ', ' honestly think this is one of the better marvel movies to come out in while most of the reason for that is kamala khan she such dork and iman vellani plays her with such enthusiasm it hard not to like her more importantly it does my heart so much good to see functional loving supportive family in superhero movie m so over all the dark gritty superhero stuff lately that could honestly watch kamala and her family being cute all day long at this point monica is well written and funny and nice to look at carol is better written than last time and brie larson seems to have gotten over whatever stiffness she had with the character which actually makes her seem like human this time around which is nice even nick fury is better written and funnier than he been in long time the movie itself is tight and lean pushing through the plot succinctly without feeling rushed and it has some pretty cool fight scenes kamala slidey spinney fighting style was particularly neat to watch when did she learn that it works better than trying to make every movie two hour plus epic when it not necessarily warranted it not like adding rich backstory or deep pathos for dar benn is going to convince any of the people leaving three star reviews she did what she needed to do and left room for the more interesting characters to shine don think there anything wrong with that it no secret marvel been stumbling lately and this isn the movie that going to turn things around for them but it definitely step in the right direction ', ' the avengers directed by joss whedon brings together marvel iconic heroes in thrilling ensemble film featuring iron man captain america thor hulk black widow and hawkeye the movie delivers high energy blend of action humor and character dynamics the cast chemistry is highlight with robert downey jr charismatic tony stark and chris evans earnest steve rogers leading the charge the interplay between characters especially during their initial clashes adds depth to the narrative tom hiddleston loki as the main antagonist brings blend of charm and menace that elevates the stakes visually the film impresses with its large scale action sequences and special effects particularly in the climactic battle in new york city whedon direction ensures balanced screen time for each hero allowing their distinct personalities to shine however the plot can feel somewhat predictable following conventional superhero blueprint while the film excels in spectacle it occasionally lacks the emotional depth of its individual character films overall the avengers is satisfying and entertaining culmination of marvel phase one providing fans with memorable and action packed cinematic experience ', ' 5 out of 5 stars the avengers is one of the best marvel superhero movie yet joss whedons direction and script delivered the movie it was fast paced action packed throughout and the story was filled with surprises the plot is great the villain loki returns and is better than ever the cast ensemble is huge but every character has spotlight and moments to shine the action sequences are exciting big and outstanding the cinematography work was great it gave the film style alan silvestri delivered promising score this movie is definitely crowd pleaser there is mid credit scene that hints for sequel and post credit scene played for laughs ', ' yes more for kids like others wrote more of disney show than marvel by the way it presented they certainly tried to please all the people not the worst ve watched can wait to see the marvel now ', ' laughed so hard cried at the family dynamic and felt it was overall great movie paid the 30 on disney plus and will watch multiple times had to google top hand to hand fighters in the marvel universe and black widow and taskmaster usually show up in the top 10 so new found respect for the black widow abilities in world of fictional characters how could you not love this movie and how is colin jost not the happiest man in the world next to me ', ' this was marvel worst creation there is no longer any power limit for the story line especially in the female part we live in time when hollywood and the media are over exploring and that has reduced quality ', ' best series of the marvels on netflix keep them coming ', ' after episode 5 ll say it of course endured lot was waiting for at least an average series but never did this is marvel worst project and tell me does anyone know who to contact to return my time spent on this masterpiece oh gods ', ' couldn believe how boring this movie was the acting is horrible the action is terrible and captain marvel herself is super cheesy this is the worst marvel movie for me alongside ant man and the wasp ', ' the first season was good but the second season turned extreme cheesy half way through want action excitement and thrill not some moral preaching and facebook quote level of philosophical dialog ', ' this is probably the most gore fest tv series have seen from marvel and am so happy that they didn try to pg rate anything this is how violent expected the punisher to be and that is what love about this series punisher has never been the hero he is always been character that justifies killing the bad guys instead of bringing them to incompetent justice you also bound to agree with him because of how brutally his family was taken away from him jon bernthal is the best guy to portray the anger violence and turbulence that runs inside frank castle he gives such an incredible and convincing performance that it never feels like him killing the bad guys is not justified his version of justice david lieberman also felt someone who was grounding frank the whole series and his arc also played well in keeping frank reminded of what it feels to have friend and family the villains are not as fleshed out as what expected after daredevil wilson fisk and jessica jones killgrave and that felt little on the nose and predictable there were no surprises as to who would be the bad guys all in all think after the miss that iron fist was the punisher is solid entry and am happy that it has all the violence and doesn shy away from the bloodshed that punisher is always surrounded by and mean it when say that there is lot of blood watch this if you are aware of the anti hero and also if you love jon bernthal as he completely shines in this series ', ' can believe that marvel is betting on this character who isn interesting at all right now hope that at some point something will change for the better ', ' this is an honest opinion can say that this series is better than the dark knight triology batman begins daredevil first season dark knight daredevil second season dark knight rises daredevil third season this is not only the best superhero series it the best superhero thing ever shown in love action if you haven watched them it must watch because it too good ', ' am middle aged white woman several years ago one of my kids chose the ms marvel graphic novel at the scholastic book fair and as my tendency and love for comics totally borrowed it when they were done really enjoyed the graphic novel there are some changes apparent already in how the show is handling it but think it for the better and some are stylistic choices that think are wise given that some things look better in comic book than live action am really enjoying how they handled the power origin so far episode 1 and really am looking forward to more of the story there my kids love it so think that means they got the essence of being teenager right they are quick to tell me when something is cringe if used that improper well m sorry have tendency to use new slang all wrong it part of parental duty ', ' criminals are evil and the only way to stop them from hurting good people is to have vigilante hunt and kill them all in the battle against evil the end justifies the means and any objection is hippie hogwash this is the basic premise of many an action movie and it is also the basic premise of the daredevil tv series the main difference is that the vigilante is wearing costume instead of regular clothes ok punisher did that as well and that he does not kill the criminals though the first few episodes leave you wondering if that tired yarn is your thing you are going to enjoy the series if not you will be bored with the main story pretty fast the action sequences are well choreographed and if you are into kung fu movies you will enjoy them even though they are too long for my tastes my main gripe with them is something else suspension of disbelief there are number of times where daredevil gets into fights that should be impossible to win unless he was gifted with invulnerability and super strength and yet he wins without those abilities the best part of the series however is not daredevil or his alter ego deborah ann woll as karen page and elden henson as foggy nelson brings some much needed humor vulnerability and soul to the series and there is an excellent chemistry between them really hope that we will see lot more of them as usual in this type of series most of the actors especially those who have some sort of agency are male of the leading criminals only one is female all the females appear to be quite weak physically and need strong male hero so save them the cynic in me suspect that some of the female characters will be killed or maimed to provoke some emotional response in one or more of the male characters hope m wrong but only time will tell the lack of physically strong females is not surprising given that the comic book series that the series is based on started in the early 1960s where the comics code authority required that all heroes and villains should be white men and women were mostly there as rewards given that so many of the main characters of daredevil and many other comic books were introduced and established back then that crap is still weighing down on us today the creators of the tv series fortunately moved past the racism but am bit sad that they only partially modernized the female characters when they were at it hopefully it will come down the line as an adaption of the daredevil comic book it is quite close to the original if you like the comic book you are going to like this it should also be noted that the series gets better as it progresses giving more space for story and character development may actually give 2nd season chance ', ' read all the negativity about season two and almost didn watch it based on that but have to say m enjoying season two lot m even enjoying it more than the previous season think it is giving the characters more depth as to understand each characters actions and way of being more ', ' cannot praise the new daredevil series on netflix enough have told everyone know how fantastic this show is and want the world to know it as well spartacus was great show as well and can definitely see some of the influence in daredevil there is fight scene in hallway where daredevil is exhausted and barely standing but keeps fighting for good cause and it is all shot in one uninterrupted sequence the camera never cuts away and daredevil is so realistically portrayed was speechless kevin smith tweeted the same sort of praise shortly after my husband and commented on the scene how very validating hope that this show continues to thrive and is appreciated by millions as much as my family appreciates it there are no hokey effects or cheesy one liners to try to make the show popular love the flash show that airs on cable but that show is definitely made to appeal to the pop culture masses daredevil is so genuine and almost believable this show should be at the top of your must list ', ' give it deserving 9 5 ben kingsley returns in this wonderful one shot and he doesn disappoint the twist in iron man 3 had the fandom divided some people liking trevor slattery and the others hating him but this one shot gives the answer to how the hate was misdirected after all before go let me tell you this wasn a work of appeasement or marvel tracking back their footsteps though they tease it little when trevor says once an actor plays part for too long he becomes the character or something on the contrary the one shot establishes the ten rings connection from the first iron man and shows that there is yet more depth to uncover in iron man own side story tldr it an awesome ride for mcu and iron man movie fans though if you are just regular movie goer chances are that you won get what all the fuss is about ', ' liked too much marvel movies but this one totally disaster there is not any difference from other disney teeange series movie colors they are singing too bad scenario etc scenario is too bad also cannot believe that how marvel did this kind of series ', ' firts of all need to say as others that jon bernthal was the perfect choice for the punisher has the looks the precense and he is imposing great actor now to the point this series looks more than military postwar drama than punisher feels more like the bastard son of homeland and tom jane pubisher he only uses his suit on episode one and final episode of s1 and 3 or 4 times in season 2 thats not superhero stuff madani and micro had more weight in the series than frank in season 1 and in season 2 madani can be the punisher with her hate for russo also dont undertstand the is so brutal action packed reviews maybe for someone who only saw the mcu and expecting laughts an light tone but this is punisher he can cut your throat with spoon without hesitation for being bad guy sometimes it feel more like tom jane punisher think it got more action too tl dr too much trauma talking to much nonsense talking to little punishment too litle punisher in full costume shooting bad guys to far away from comics to slow to be consider action packed dont know whats going to happend now in full disney control maybe punisher not using guns ', ' agents of h e d is one of the best shows that there is on television not only has the show endured for five seasons but it has also become better each season such progression is very rare to find in television but agents of h e d does it spectacularly not only does the show have quality but it also has diverse cast consisting of people with different races sexuality and religion this creates sense that everyone no matter who society tells them they are can matter like the characters on the show over the past four seasons the plot took surprising turn in season four with the splitting of the plot into three pods format never to be seen in the superhero genre this format not only kept the interest of the viewers but helped the marvel show to become critically acclaimed during its fourth season with the coming of season five in december agents of h e d will reach its 100th episode the fact that the show will reach its 100th episode proves that the show not only has excellent quality and content but also has strong and loyal fan base marvel agents of h e d is one of the best superhero shows on television and keeps on getting better ', ' think daredevil is the best superhero character that marvel has made ever actually thank the writer of this beautiful series and marvel studio to gave the world this amazing character and please keep using of this character and have big thank for charlie cox for his bright acting make sequel to this series please ', ' don know why everybody is hating but thought it was so good and cant wait for the continuation movie with florence which you know they will do ', ' captain marvel is an entertaining film but not one of the best from the mcu brie larson is pretty good but at times seems little wooden really liked the twist with the villain and the story is pretty good the action is enjoyable but nothing too special nick fury is the stand out in my opinion for the most part the stuff in here is good but not great 7 5 10 ', ' voices style atmosphere and drawings all terrible this is not avengers but cheap knockoff ', ' let me just say upfront can stand jon bernthal the guy is horribly miscast in this show find him completely annoying hated him as shane on twd and have been annoyed by him in everything he has ever been in especially fury so here we are getting more of the same he is goofy looking person that hollywood is trying to pass off as tough looking it doesn work and am not buying it further more who decided to cast shohreh aghdashloo she is horrifying on screen especially when she speaks what is going on with her voice shouldn so harsh am guessing that she is probably undergoing some kind of extreme steroid medication am sorry if she is suffering from medical condition but the fact is this is tv show and we are trying to be entertained not distracted by her man voice the show itself is boring simply boring the characters are boring and they don have much to do this might as well be show about marine suffering from ptsd it doesn have to be called the punisher unless the aim of the people who create this show is to punish us the viewers with boredom don bother with this mess if you watch you will just see bernthal agonizing over the loss of his family boring ', ' went into this with guarded optimism let face it the movies that led up to it were fun but nothing more but after seeing this movie it not only gets my nod for best super hero movie ever it probably going right into my top 10 all time movies director whedon has proved that he can take intense action witty dialogue and some real emotion and tie them all together into package that never feels forced too often ensemble movies like this try too hard to manufacture tension between members or artificially manufacture importance for one character at the expense of another but everything here flows the avengers have always involved internal conflict and the movie portrays it perfectly without going over the top or under playing it at any point it also obvious that there is real love and respect for the characters as it all feels true to how they were originally written in all ways true winner ', ' this is marvel green lantern but with more boring protagonist ', ' when went to see this movie believed the hype and was very anxious to see it was well prepared had seen all the relevant marvel movies leading to this avengers initiative after seeing this movie left the cinema that cold rainy night feeling overwhelmly satisfied rarely you find gem of film in life and this has to be one of them marvel best live action movie since men 2 was gripped to my seat and didn even notice the 2 hours slip by didn even stay for the end credits where m told small clip is played which will certainly mean sequel didn stay for the end credits because spontaneously rushed to see this film alone for the first time in my life don laugh only regret that couldn share this extravaganza with someone other then the strangers with me in the cinema great storyline great special effects great action some comedy and soul this film has it all and it for everyone just don see how they can make the sequel better than this but will be interested to see what else stan lee has got under his sleeves 10 10 ', ' there wasnt anything about this movie that was good they had so much time to do this and this is all that was put out total waste of time ', ' well it is all shiny and stuff to have all the super heroes together but without any real plot its just lot of soulless fireworks with an attempt to manufacture positive response from the audience with the indestructible nature of the hulk and thor what need is there of the rest as for the wit element bought to us mainly by iron man it is overdone there has to be balance to take the viewers on true ride of emotion suspense and overall awe elements that this movie just does not have still do not understand how this can get rating above 7 which brings about an element of doubt as to the rating system and credibility of all rated movies on this site ', ' this is solid film plenty of fun and action d heard all the criticism much of which isn deserved the musical element was unnecessary but didn detract from the overall film the main cast work really well together slj was superb fans of captain marvel will appreciate the film even more than the average mcu fan feel my cinema fee wasn wasted and will watch it again when it drops on disney brie larson continues to establish herself as captain marvel and being worthy of leading the avengers in future projects believe if this film doesn achieve what is desired in the box office then brie should get d series shoul ', ' can without doubt best action sci fi movie ever most see the action was almost flawless the 3d effect was awesome the acting was great as the actors was great the comedy was great to it makes the whole movie to fit no movie is flawless but what can say about this guys love the actors in the movie really liked the story but some scenes the could think about the little thing don not want to spoil it and review it you most see to understand i don not think everyone sees that little mistakes but without any regards will give it 10 because have not seen any movie yet that has this good scenes in it go and see ', ' hey there this is good balance of gotg and thor humor with tinge of the more serious side of the mcu it is really worth seeing just to get young sammy in the house once again as well as few other peeps from the past of the mcu the second ending scene is kinda drag to wait for with little payoff but the first one is pretty solid on all levels as well as getting james bond reference in there bl does fine job of being the first fem hero just makes ya wonder what scarlet your so handsome has to say about getting passed on enjoy the ride it is far from being the worst offering so far spot venom holds firmly and in absolutely ', ' florence pugh and scarlett johansson had great chemistry think taskmaster will return ', ' ve only just finished it and im unclear as to the baddies name or motivation so not much peril nor storyline either to be fair lazy writing can we as punters strike for better writing talent or perhaps suggest performance related pay for screenwriters glass eyed acting from nearly everyone aside from iman vellani who was great and cgi beast who managed to be more human than the rest of the cast still the cats were cool but verging on too much of good thing massive budget next time spend all the cash over 200m on hospital or fix poverty or set up school for writers or swinging worthwhile ', ' saw this on opening day in my local imax and was swept along by the space adventure of the team up between carol monica and kamala it was great to see the chemistry between the cast reflected in the characters and welcome return of kamala family who would quite rightly be along for the ride given their daughter is only teenager and their love and concern for her safety means they need to be there to support her the film was visually striking with great space scenes new planets and great score by laura karpman who gives the heroic trio their own theme ignore the haters go see it ', ' this is the greatest mcu movie have watched in my opinion great way to start the avenger films ', ' it really irritating when they show as indian or pakistan culture which is so fake pls if want to show pakistan or india hire pakistan actors directors and crew and cast do not try to showcase culture which is forced not real ', ' this show is the absolute best kind one in which your suspension of disbelief is high but mostly unnecessary due to how well this show is crafted it seems everyone who put effort into this show wanted to make somthing truly unique and it shows my personal favorite out of any show ever ', ' am so upset this has been getting any negative reviews the show is joyful fun and love the entire cast there even small bollywood feel in some of the action scenes love learning about the history of pakistan india and the use of their religion and myths in the backstory it very well made ve been telling everyone to watch it ', ' giving my 8yo daughter glimpse into the live action superhero universe was lot of fun we know have standing appointment to watch this show who cares if the protagonist doesn look like her kamala khan does look like her bff who is muslim and indian so she gets peek into that world as well neither of us read the comics but she starting to show interest in graphic novels of other books she read maybe this will bring an interest into superhero comics as well ', ' phase 4 wasn the most perfect phase with movies and series but you know there we re some good stuff in it but then ant man 3 came and it was bad really bad and just as tough it couldn get any worse this came out glad that didn spend my money for it to see it in theater but really marvel what went wrong in the last 4 years this movie is just so trash the cgi bad the acting bad the story itself bad and why so many women like don mind to see movie where woman has the main rol but come on this is just exhausting overal this was the absolute worse of all of marvel and hopefully marvel will get back to there feet and make good movies like they always did ', ' true its hard to forget all the issues regarding captain marvel prior to the release of the movie but the movie does perfect job in making you forget this the first 20 min are so full of information and shots without context at that moment that you are too busy thinking about what you are seeing more them anything else after that all thats left is good marvel flick with some nice new angles of approach to this kind of movie and boy cant wait to are cm in endgame go goose ', ' just another show to have porn in next they will have ron jeremy as the bad guy what is the difference between this and any porn flic out there it like nextflix writes shows around the sex scenes just see if they can get to the next level ', ' dissapointed af in that ending matt murdock is pu ', ' m here m currently halfway through season 7 and will tell you that agents of shield is amazing and deserves watch know some reviews found the first season slow but personally didn i liked that coming off the heels of the avengers universe hot this show needed its own world and context building hydra is reintroduced and set up perfectly slowly you get introduced deeper and deeper into the conflict between hydra and shield humans with superhuman abilities internal conflict within shield new worlds new timelines sure maybe some of the stories are bit out there but if you let your mind run wild with the wildest science fiction fantasies you ll love the consistent action suspense and amazing technology this show has to offer this show has built some of the deepest relationships between partners between friends between teams have watched in all the shows ve watched do give it try this show is worth wayyy higher than the current rating ludicrous that shows like arrow and flash have higher ratings than this one ', ' as father of two marvel movies have been way for me and my children to share hobby and usually plan movie nights and tv shows for series like star wars and marvel but ms marvel has utterly ruined perfect family tradition both my 5 years old boy and my 7 year old girl have no interest in the ms marvel tv show and me being full grown man definitely can find anything to love about this show who is this show for if family can get into it we tried 2 episodes and now my kids have fully given up on the show congrats disney ', ' anyone who tells you this movie is anything more than 6 or 6 5 is just flat out wrong yes movies are subjective but this movie although entertaining and funny at parts fails to really grab hold of the viewer and make them care about any of the characters the movie just expects us to care for natasha sister and father are the highlights of the film and that really it they wasted great character in task master the villain played by fantastic actor was also wasted opportunity ', ' was skeptic about the avengers very few heroes movies have deserved good critics but must admit the film is great great action amazing special effects and script that goes straight to what we expect action and fights the kind of things we expect from super heroes while transformers really sucked because of spending lot of time on stupid romancing and forced jokes the avengers succeed on providing intelligent funny scenes even in the middle of war that being said ve seen some comparisons between avengers and dark knight sorry to say but dark knight is miles away and that being said by guy who just liked marvel comics now the bad part this movie has confirmed my feelings 3d definitely adds nothing but discomfort to the movies ve gone to the imax 3d just to be sure my issue with 3d weren the theater no good you can barely notice 3d ve seen inception on imax 2d it was amazing after leaving the avengers really desired had seen the 2d version after all the fact that 3d sucks so much doesn reduce the fact that if you re looking for fun the avengers will provide you lot ', ' finally binged the whole season now no spoilers but this show was directionless not tied into the mcu very well and just adds more needless content into the mcu in franchise already overcrowded with nonsense the acting was another point of aggravation don know where the ball dropped on the mcu for it bad acting kinda seems like right after that infinity war but it becoming unacceptable to have such poor performances in the high budget shows didn give this 1 star because am such huge marvel fan but this show just didn do anything for me ', ' personally do not good chance you re too young to remember those shows they fall under the genre of monotonous teen drama as does this that said if you liked the ms marvel book you might like this only read the first arc when it came out as whole don like teen hero comics because adults writing teen dialogue is often goofy and off point zeb wells new mutants is the only one d consider good story to the point don like the show because m not the target audience vellani acting is fine and the father seems like good character there just too much drama that isn interesting there also bit of alluding to this trendy revisionist history where every country was wonderful hippie commune until the british arrived and ruined their peaceful utopia history is full of sinners and suffering not the writers fault guess but that of the modern education system ', ' liked the movie it definitely solid 8 but m giving it 10 to compensate for the 1s that saw on here bet it mostly dudebros who are annoyed woman is finally getting the spotlight she deserves lmao idk what movie all watched but black widow was definitely not side character anyway the plot was good it was engaging and the action scenes were really good sure the vfx was shaky at times but tbh don really care that much about it the found family dynamics were refreshing and funny it one of the few mcu movies that actually develops relationships between characters tbh it definitely in my top 3 mcu movies to everyone complaining about taskmaster liked the twist and hope they ll develop the character some more if you don like it just shut up and stick to the comics lmao ', ' the marvels brand new epic space adventure from

spoilerfree moviereview movieaddict spoilerfreereview ', ' am 29 and avenger assemble was the first movie which felt at end there will be more scenes as hulk action made the end more enegertic finally perfect 10 after seeing avenger assemble become one of avenger fan ', ' almost didn watch this movie because so many movies made in 2021 have been so bad but have to say that m glad decided to take the time to watch this one not only did it have almost non stop action it also had really heart warming cute story line that was at times really funny it may not be this years great movie but it was certainly entertaining ', ' the avengers is the story of some of marvel well known super heroes that band together in joint effort to save the world we know from men in black that the world is always in need of saving so will take term from that film and say that this is the best of the best of the best this film has some first rate spectacular out of this world and any other term that can think of to convey how good the special effects the performances the casting the direction and everything else in it is did see it in 3 which was totally worth the added premium if were wearing hat d give joss whedon director writer hats off for delivering this action packed extravaganza the story has very clever dialog in that the characters are able to convey exactly what the audience needs to know without it seeming as though we are auditing super hero 101 lecture although this is what will call compilation sequel it was fresh and original and could have easily stood on its own had we not been given all of the prior introduction movies not that m complaining about any of them iron man tony stark robert downey jr was successfully arrogant and enduring at the same time his and hulk bruce banner mark ruffalo intellectual bonding was intriguing enough that m hoping for an iron man featuring hulk follow up film the thor chris hemsworth and loki tom hiddleston sibling rivalry could render countless sequels and was front and center in this story but will expect to see heimdall idris elba in any subsequent stories or no deal my only issue with the set up films is that there was only the small side story featuring black widow scarlett johansson in iron man kept hearing james brown in my head singing this is man world but from where sat it wouldn be nothing without woman or hulk mean girl natasha romanoff held her own in this boys fight club and riding on the success of this film could easily carry black widow film know know historically the female super hero lead doesn fare well at the box office but blame the vehicle not the passenger ever since the incredibles have these smiling moments when the bad guys start monologuing hulk has the best response to it ve seen to this day give this film hulking green light ', ' as an avengers fan would consider my self slightly impressed but would expect joss whedon to raise the bar little higher agents of h e d has great writing effects and production the casting seems great it just needs more feeling from the acting and direction e little more color from the characters would like some more character background but expect we will get that in upcoming episodes the first episode had great story line it seemed to setup episode 2 perfectly great start m looking forward to episode 2 ', ' what even was this how was it this bad how was the best character of thr movie also the most annoying carol danvers is charisma vacuum where no joy or happiness can escape her grasp she even shows the characteristics or movie villian the only time this person smiles is when she is causing misery on others the villian might be the worst mcu vilian yet and that is saying something just saw this movie and already forgot her name her evil villian plan is literally in the ploy for the movie space balls that movie is parody is great movies calling the marvel a parody is an insult to parodies shame on you disney ', ' loved this movie fast paced lots of great fighting funny lines all the women are bad ass thought it was great even shed tear watching one of the scenes think you should give it go ', ' confess that m not huge comic book or superhero fan m more of scifi nerd and can sometimes find god like superheroes to be unrelatable and without weight to their action and stories something about their demigod nature takes the visceral feel and characterization away and m honestly burnt out with all the superhero oversaturization and was not excited about yet another marvel series but was completely blown away by this series it not the lighthearted cgi action of the marvel movies or the indulgently dysphoric type of show like the walking dead or game of thrones where it exists simply to attempt to one up itself in more and more shocking moments with nothing redeemable this show is dark and gritty without it being about shock value at all it really sort of reminds me of d version of batman as daredevil murdock being conflicted and troubled hero with principles one of the greatest aspects to the show is that there are several characters other than just murdock who have their own story and development and are just as important has he is kingpin has characterization in season 1 almost as compelling as murdock i find the acting fantastic the action well choreographed and with true weight that you can feel m to the latter half of season 2 right now and m just as entertained with this season as the first and they ve introduced some other characters in this universe very well also appreciate the smaller scale of this series compared to the justice league men avengers where the heroes are so powerful that they need to keep just fighting god like villains and it always the world universe in peril to the point where just don feel it anymore daredevil is about people yes some are quite unique but they re people and it the city neighborhood and everyday life that matters it a superhero show but it a crime drama as well similar to batman just can recommend this show highly enough love it ', ' think 7 5 is under rated very under rated it at least should get 9 even the average of the episodes is 8 4 and its rating is 7 5 fun huh even rotten tomatoes give it 95 consider it one of the best but in imdb 7 5 considering one of the worst so think some one have to consider its rating ', ' one of my favorite marvel series on netflix really does the comic justice ', ' started watching and see oh look the lead played jane from breaking bad thought she was pretty good in bb and would be interesting to see her in another role unfortunately it seemed as if she was playing the same character which does not work playing the lead for this role jessica has absolutely no redeeming or interesting qualities she has such horrible personality and habits that you just do not care enough about her to keep watching can remember her exact age but remember her friend saying she was 30 something yet she acts like spoiled annoying and obnoxious 16 year old brat you would rather not be around it felt like was watching your typical cw network teenage angst series which is uncharacteristic for woman her age am not prude by any means but her interracial sex scenes with luke were just over the top gratuitous it made no sense to the plot but rather seems like it was supposed to be oh look how edgy we are by having the white girl lead have an over the top raunchy sex scenes with big black man the sex scenes were not even sexy and just made her look gross and pathetic luke however seemed like far more interesting character was looking forward to binging through another original and even if something is all not that good sometimes stay with it got half way through the 3rd episode and was like what am doing this has just been awful just can take anymore of this am done saw the marvell logo come up before the show started and think maybe this is targeted to teenagers even if it is it is still crap if this is type of crap marvell puts out and if netflix is going in that direction with marvell originals then will be canceling my netflix subscription btw this is from reviewer that liked originals river bloodline marco polo borgia and orange ', ' while the build up in first few episodes is okay the author director really lost the plot in the last episode it was not really clear what ms marvel was looking to achieve ', ' season 1 was nice with new kind of villain who was human but could control people but they ruined it with second season it was so damn boring don watch after 1st season disappointed with marvel they should just stick to movies ', ' first half is bit slow second half flows better like where the skrull story went there are few too cheesy moments that seem bit biased mostly in scenes with maria on earth also didn like law and larson chemistry it seems as larson is trying too much to not have expressions in many cases in their joint scenes when law makes it seem more natural and less stiff captain marvel big moment with her full power is bit blunt all in all it an ok movie expected better result but it not for the trash as many suggest it a 6 10 for me ps it was promoted as the last step before endgame and having heard so many times how powerful captain marvel is during 2018 can safely say even if you skip it and go straight to endgame you want miss anything you already know how powerful she is ', ' in theory there could be film made from this material that is all right good don know but there could be some fun and drama in the power and body swap concept of kind sadly there is no fun in this film at all it a mess it tries to wisecrack at moments when it should be serious it heavy handed when it should lighten up it emotional at the wrong moments and cold at the wrong moments truly it is mess the writing is just really bad suspect too many writers were involved with too many corporate demands on them to meet various aims so that the result is that no character has any real moment where you care about them because they don show any depth or consistency in who they are they are just series of ill timed jokes and tedious comments interspersed by not great special effects of people punching each other think the worst is that there are no stakes no one seems to really care about anything therefore as the audience you don care either have no idea what the point was really don recommend this film ', ' see lot of reviews talking about how terrible it is but really enjoyed it several reviews are saying that it was too feminist and political but felt like they managed to largely stay away from that which appreciated great chemistry between natasha and yelena know lot of the hate has to do with it adherence to the comics but frankly just look for good story and fun to watch movie ', ' if you have any type of anxiety issues this movie will drive you insane the constant popping from person to person from place to place is nerve wracking and let not even talk about the music choices come on people pick some decent music in these movies my husband wanted to watch it otherwise would ve turned it off shortly after starting had to put ear plugs in and just close my eyes it was so utterly annoying ended up falling asleep while he finished it he was interested since he read the comic books but to me it was just irritating thank god we didn have to pay to see it would ve been running from the theater ', ' the story idea for this could ve been good but the writing and pacing of the film just let it down the characters weren there at all nobody was likeable or interesting and the dialogue was awful throughout the only character with any kind of development was david harbour but when your comic relief is better thought out character and has more charisma than your lead then you have problem there was no drama or any sense of risk in the film not only do you not care about the characters but you know whatever happens to them physically they ll just get back up and carry on the action set pieces were fine but at times the editing didn seem to make sense and characters started to do something and then in the next shot they are back where they were before it all felt bit slap dash and half hearted in sea of bad russian accents though ray winstone does shine and deserves special mention there is nothing even remotely original here overall it feels like knock off marvel movie with better effects think this is the problem when you commit to this kind of production line of films and interlinked tv shows things become more about making product than making good film ', ' to begin with this movie is just unnecessary this movie is very bad and super boring m glad never saw this in the cinema because it not worth your time all characters but really all characters are stupid and unlikeable especially the main character natasha is clich very disturbing what also disturbs but all marvel films and series have that is the extreme predictability it seems more like this movie is made for small kids because for anyone over 5 years old it boring so boring that without doing anything it unsustainable because you just fall asleep cringy and predictable ', ' so awesome those were the first two words that came to mind as scoured my brain in an effort to find fitting description of what had just witnessed why be loquacious when two such honestly efficient words will do come on what else do you want me to say the avengers hits the ground in overdrive downs six pack of energy drinks and rarely takes breath during the course of its purely entertaining 142 minute runtime burdened with glorious purpose loki tom hiddleston makes his presence known quickly he comes to earth to rule and leaves nick fury samuel snakes on plane jackson and his awesome eyepatch with no choice but to revisit the failed avengers initiative the film recognizes that there are lot of male egos that need clashing and thus wastes no time in delivering exactly what the audience wants to see 2 hours of superhero bliss as intense and exhilarating as the climactic 40 minute battle against loki and his minions is the hero vs hero alpha male vs alpha male build up is even better captain america vs thor iron man vs thor thor vs hulk hawkeye vs black widow come on now think even saw kitchen sink in there battling it out director joss whedon clearly thought through the scenarios that fans would want and he flawlessly delivers them with style little panache if you will executing the individual battles in way that does justice to the characters is not an easy task but the special effects and 7 1 surround sound are crafted to perfection if you ve seen the individual avenger movies then you know exactly what to expect from the characters tony stark robert downey jr cracks wise with his sarcastic humor thor chris hemsworth cracks heads with his magic hammer captain america chris evans cracks nary smile with his old school no nonsense patriotism and hulk mark ruffalo well he just smashes add black widow scarlett johansson the former russian assassin and hawkeye jeremy renner master with the bow and arrow to the mix and that is whole lot of superheroes demanding limited amount of screen time the good news is whedon handles this potential problem seamlessly giving everybody ample time to do their thing and play their part the biggest surprise both literally and figuratively has to be the hulk not only is this the most realistic version of the beloved green rage monster that been delivered to the big screen but he simply steals every scene he in the avengers is the kind of roller coaster thrill ride of movie that takes me back to the magic felt as kid every time walked into the theater and sat down to watch much anticipated summer blockbuster it a refreshing blend of humor and action that lets you check out of your reality for couple of hours and check into an exciting world where good triumphs evil and it does so in marvelously inventive ways if you can enjoy the avengers then fear you simply can enjoy life shoot me an email and we ll see if we can introduce some joy into your world ', ' want to like this can i not huge fan of ms marvel but do like the character however the complete change in her powers is just weird and incomprehensible it up there with making galactus into cloud or sewing deadpool mouth up and giving him swords coming out of his arms or making the rhino into whatever that was supposed to be or making collosus an american at least they fixed deadpool and collosus in the end not to mention what was done to dr doom can understand the problem of the inhuman origin but why not make her mutant completely changing her powers changes too much about her and it makes it too distracting to like it ', ' the more profits they got the more worst movie they made disney this chunk of bad advice is probably responsible for more lost sales than any other human utterance while people want you to remember their name it sounds creepy and false friendly when you repeat their name in conversation or document btw substitute their own voice for their own name and the quote is quite true 2 most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all while this seems true at first glance it only because the came from behind against all odds miracles stick in the mind because they re unusual in reality most of the important things in this world are well planned and well executed without generating any hopelessness whatsoever sometimes hopelessness is sign that you re beating your head against wall ', ' while many parts of this movie were interesting it has absolutely been confusing ride it has felt as if they had no real plan direction from the start it not horrible movie but did feel lost for much of it parts that seemed like they should ve been explained better before the movie or had better connections inside the movie would have helped was also drinking straight the entire time watched this movie so that probably didn help but was lost far more than should ve been trying to understand the plot the mcu is still great but you can tell they are having to reach for all these new characters to be as successful as previous films ', ' too many twist and turns to keep the show interesting in the end disappointed ', ' quality has definitely moved to tv if you want thoughtful superhero action watch loki or wandavision this was the cinematic equivalent of the fast and the furious 9 ', ' believe me when say that the avengers was my most anticipated movie ever mean come on bunch of superheroes gathering and fighting evil that is just priceless and not any superheroes but the most well known and well loved the movie has some of the best actors in hollywood portraying some of the best superheroes to have ever been created this movie has loads of captain america iron man thor hawkeye and needless to say hulk smash they were all portrayed on screen brilliantly and give thanks to the actor for making them feel awesome cool and really really fun live in australia and we get an earlier viewing of the film but for you americans this wait is is worth it when the movie was over most of the cinema clapped this was the first time had ever seen this ever at the movies even though it was 12 in the morning the whole cinema was packed and all of them came out of the cinema satisfied and were glad they paid the 13 to watch it the plot of the movie is straightforward but done magnificently loki previously seen in thor wants to wreak havoc on earth by letting group of aliens enter earth through portal it up to the avengers to stop him but first they have to solve the rivalries and bitterness between them the fight scenes between the superheroes are just cking awesome was so excited to see thor and iron man battle it out that scene was just plain epic the music and soundtrack in the movie was good and it did nice job of alleviating the action and trust me there is lot of action the visual effects are also fantastic one of the best have ever seen in film and they will leave you in awe hulk along with iron man do good job of adding humour into the film and all of the scenes with the hulk left everyone at the cinemas laughing it is pretty obvious that his squad mates think highly of him as seen in the scene where stark and loki have confrontation we have an army we have hulk that scene was what did it for me if you guys are in doubt as to see this then let me assure you that you are gonna get the bang for your buck that you deserve so far it is one of the best superhero film made but of all time not really sure guess we have to wait for tdkr to come out 10 10 perfect over and out 25 april 2012 ', ' another marvel movie that doesn narrate the story of the main character but instead makes references about the other marvel movies past and future as well the beginning is quite promising then everything falls into this deep rabbit hole that doesn make sense anymore dialogues are confusing and the whole attempt on making everything funny even on sensitive issues is pure cringe whole milking the cow situation imo it not worth the 2 hours of watching black widow original story from the comics is great it probably just needed some time adaptations but it would ve made an amazing film m definitely disappointed ', ' brie larson and samuel jackson were good together in the movie and it was fun ', ' the quality of this franchise is going down fast movies are becoming too corny the acting is similar to cheesy exaggerated sitcoms the franchise should review the movies that were successful and how they managed it stop leaning so much into the silly and goofy acting and try rebalancing the seriousness of it im not sure who the current target audience but its aimed at the wrong people fight scenes in this movie were done poorly moves were clearly telegraphed scenes with kamala family were very cringy people don act that way and audiences look for some sort of realism to grasp onto you want to think maybe some of whats going on is possible similar to how iron man first created his suit and just barely managed to escape remember your roots and get back to the good stuff it all went down hill after end game ', ' this film failed massively in letting us get to know who the major characters are or even the two alien races who despise each other even now can remember if we re even told why the two races were at war with each other in the first place for large part of the first act danvers can remember who she is and we are only assisted in finding out via occasional flashbacks or voiceovers frankly felt as confused as the character we only find out about the main character background with tidbits of info didn really understand what was happening or why and despite some flashy action sequences found myself bored the point when started to become interested in the film was following chase sequence in which we finally get to meet fury jackson was de aged for the entire film and it looked flawless the biggest compliment can pay is that after the first time we see him quickly forgot about the special effects and just saw him as young fury in the second act we begin to discover more about danvers as she begins to learn about herself we see the origin of her powers and it at that point that the film finally begins to be interesting don know why they couldn have just started with that and told linear origin story instead of doing all the stupid confusing flashbacks danvers and fury end up turning this film into sort of buddy cop style of film the two of them are working together cracking jokes while trying to discover the mystery of her identity this part was actually fun there also segment where danvers meets with an old friend maria and her daughter monica have to admit that at no point did feel like these girls were at one time close friends just didn buy it that said the relationship danvers had with her friend daughter was cute other fun aspects include the 90 soundtrack and hits of nostalgia we also meet goose the cat the cat was certainly one of the most interesting characters the last act is ok although it was let down by the fact that it became standard cgi fight what worse though is that it wasn even well shot fight the colour pallet was mostly grim the choreography was nothing to write home about and the outcome was downright predictable overall there were some aspects which enjoyed as well some parts where was bored ', ' this film is not only spectacular but its an historic superhero feature film at its best this is worth the wait hell this was worth the wait 7 years ago when it was first developed do we really think this will be in development hell this is the avengers earth mightiest heroes this is something what has never been done before marvel has got there finger on the pulse in 1998 minor marvel character featuring human vampire hybrid made it way to the big screen in 2000 group of mutants evolved into the box office in 2002 was the year of the spider after daredevil hulk ang lee the punisher elektra man thing fantastic four ghost rider marvel studios would start producing its own films and distribute them through paramount pictures the funding will come from seven year 525 million revolving credit facility with merrill lynch the result led to the creation of the marvel cinematic universe sounds cool right it was no really it in was iron man made its motion picture debut the hulk got rebooted thor captain america have finally got the big screen treatment then came huge shift in the marvel universe marvel entertainment is now owned by mickey mouse amazing disney let go the power rangers franchise bought marvel but after everything from comics to tv film marvel has put out it comes to show just how far they come as company knowing the fact that the biggest supporters including me are the fans that is why they can not disappoint us yeah we complain about story lines costumes special effects but if they stay true to the comics the films would have done its justice but know deep down marvel studios will always put out films stay close to the material so what ve said earlier was it worth the wait yes yes it was definitely worth it marvel studios the cast crew of the avengers did an amazing job on the marvel cinematic universe can wait to see what comes next now if dc warner bros step their game up we would like to see the justice league into the big screen ', ' it ok and gives lot of background but it is boring and just sets up another movie probably will watch again in the future for the proposes of knowing as much as can about marvel ', ' ve always loved ms marvel stories and think the show is starting off very strong love the coming of age aspect of it and the show as whole totally appeals to me we need to remember different marvel projects will have different target audiences as 17 year old junior in hs nerdy girl obsessed with superheros myself kamala story of finding her place in the world while going through high school and finding community in fandom culture really resonates with me am not pakistani but from hearing young poc opinions understand that kamala heritage and struggle with her clashing cultures is important to her character and story and that her existing in now mainstream media as superhero and rounded character is immense for young people of color think the show is getting along perfectly balancing kamala nerdy teenager life and her pakistani culture through writing and sick visual storytelling this show feels like it for younger audience because it is maybe just don get unreasonably mad at tv shows or maybe it because what m seeing in ms marvel so far is genuinely wonderful but think this show is setting up lot of great character arch and superhero action that can wait for because at the end of the day these shows are made for us to have fun so stop being mean to children on tv pls cool ', ' don think disney should ve made this one it pretty bad acting but maybe that the result of bad writing understand why they made this given all the asian hate going on right now which is terrible m sure there a better way to serve the asian community then making bad show ', ' when first watched this had never really been that into marvel films so didn really know what was what hadn previously watched iron man iron man 2 thor or any hulk movie so do suggest watching them first but when did watch it was so totally mind blown by the pure amazement in how awesome this film was that became right marvel nerd marvel avengers assembel one of the most amazing films have ever seen in my life and would definitely suggest watching it this movie makes the most awesome gift and would make anyone smile ', ' by the second episode found myself skipping through to the end to see some of the action just can get on board with it it a bog standard origin story which we ve seen before mixed with teen high school drama the only thing that different about this is the diversity ll maybe persevere with one more episode if the action can be bothered to get going ', ' when justice is not done in proper way by giving them proper punishment or the criminals uses the power to roam out then the guy like frank castle punisher will be coming to serve the justice in his own way when daredevil is absolute good series then punisher is absolute beast hope season 3 comes ', ' deserves their own story and this one proves the case stunts are great as are fx but otherwise unremarkable and even boring the new girl however was big treat on all levels ', ' love the punisher but it seems hollywood can get it right for once they cast the right lead but some of the supporting actors and the writing are let down neither of the first two seasons are particularly exciting or original and some of the acting wooden to say the least here hoping they get the balance right if there is season 3 ', ' its either the cringy scenes lack of depth or bad acting that make this episode so bad the episode has the quality of netflix youtube parody on the mcu hope they do not follow this theme for any other mcu content ', ' will keep this short and brief the plot was paper thin the characters used cheesy lines which dragged the movie out and the special effects compensated for the former flaws the movie basically shows that consumers are dumb enough to actually rate movie high like the rating is simply because enough special effects where thrown in their faces to distract from the awful parts to footnote only few directors have actually been able to write and direct their own movie properly and with much success joss whedon is not one of them ', ' 10 ot of 10 from me and big thumbs down for the haters its just another super enjoyable movie from marvel it just doesn deserve the hate it gets ', ' this show has potential to do lot better elizabeth henstridge as jemma simmons is the real find she is awesome the pace of story in first season is slow until the captain america movie the show gets lot better after that but they have to exceed the role of elizabeth as jemma she is not on screen for long in second season her mission in hydra is not on screen for enough time fights are good clark gregg as phil coulson is always good hope they can do better in upcoming episodes but right now boring boring not good ', ' stupid stupid stupid this show is disney feeling silly callous without feeling can even understand this show the plot makes no sense lots of horrible shot scenes bad dialogue and none of the avengers are here what even is this show this is the worst marvel tv show if could make more empty would not have to take my heart and shoot it with bullets of horrible conversations bad scenes no action weird scenes about weddings this is bad tv show and think that is horrible hate the dialogue this tv show feels like that the avengers are the only ones that are good ', ' m not big on netflix originals but after watched the netflix original series the punisher was curious how could netflix create something for the marvel universe everything loved about the punisher came out in the daredevil loveable characters dark back stories it has something for everyone recommend this to anyone that enjoys the dark and gritty side of marvel ', ' scarlett johansson really shined in her last adventure which featured stellar cast of supporting actors and let me tell you that the action never really lets up found the movie like any other marvel movie great watch and it had plenty of explosions and stunts that defied gravity the only gripe had with this film was the undercooked villains really in my opinion is that the only great villains of the mcu have been loki and thanod all in all would watch it again but only on disney when it becomes available to stream at no no charge ', ' marvel movies and tv shows have come long way this is easily the best super hero tv show ever but it still not great of course we re treated to daredevil origin changed for your enjoyment it a complete waste of time if you don know dd origin by now it doesn really matter while dd has never been my favorite matt murdock is my favorite secret identity most of them are boring lame pathetic like parker and kent or just d bag like stark or wayne mm is genuinely interesting person my only real issue with the show is vincent onofrio as the kingpin he just the guy from law order he doesn even try but it just another big hollywood boot to the face of all marvel fans although there is plenty of action the plot unfolds quite slowly if had to wait week or more between episodes would have given up before the end of season one taking year off will ensure that most people forget and or lose interest ', ' what is worse the incredible amount of cultural appropriation or the hyper color in every scene disney is doing their best to ruin the mcu as they did star wars ', ' really tried to like this but it just wasn very good had this come out after civil war it might have been slightly more enjoyable but 2 years after the in universe death of black widow it is pretty much waste of everyones times ', ' not bad at all but the first marvel movie wasn dying to see again it gonna be while before even think of coming back to this ', ' have been regular on imdb for the past 7 years but never have ever been so compelled to write review was so amped up to watch jessica jones and its all turned out to be huge waste of my time poor story overly dramatic acting except for kilgrave nothing boils my blood more than characters making dumb life choices and believe me jj is full of it and on top of everything else see people rating the serial 9 10 and even the individual episodes are 8 8 to 9 2 stars m extremely disappointed at this show maybe coz after daredevil had such high hopes bet you if you watch this show you will be pulling your hair out by the time you get to the 11 episode that when started contemplating suicide ', ' the mcu is back at its most banal as the first female superhero standalone film kicks into predictable action marvel has spent nearly decade building up the mysterious black widow character backstory only to have it unraveled and crumbled in an awkward paced and unnecessarily long standalone film the inorganic and too often forced sentiments demonstrate nothing more than inferior character development marvel had all the time in the world to do justice for fan favorite female superhero but no and what even worse black widow as the title suggests was just that much less of protagonist than her little sister ', ' ms marvel is fun show that explores kamala discovering herself and her powers it fantastic loved seeing the representation that we never saw in older marvel shows movies kamala is relatable funny and loveable bruno and nakia are vibe overall great show ', ' just can believe this movie has rating of over 8 stars on imdb it consists of every clich you can imagine and there is absolutely nothing that could recommend it for more than super hero movie actually fell asleep in the cinema and when woke up after 2 3rds of the movie was not surprised to find that hadn missed anything the plot unfolded as expected didn fall asleep because was tired but because everything in this movie is so unbelievably boring the acting is below average and all characters except iron man portrayed by robert downey junior are as dull as you can get it was total waste of time and money ', ' bringing earths mightiest heroes together was brilliant idea as have never seen better superhero movie like it and in the bright action world of marvel watch the heroes do whats best from each individual as they all have their fair share of screen time such as iron man being cocky captain america being heroic thor bringing the lightning and of course hulk smash couldn hate minuet of it and its always great film when you want to see more at the end the only criticism could barely dig out from the depths of my thoughts was stan lee could of had better cameo but sometimes life doesn go that way but if you can get over 89 year old man having short part that lasted 4 seconds then you will appreciate this amazing film if you want good time to spend some hours gazing at the first film to unite multiple heroes to one universe then this is it ', ' the first episode was something special it was so fun and vibrant and full of all the potential for an amazing series went in thinking yes this is gonna be amazing but then episode 2 came along and though it was alright it lost that first episode magic then episode 3 was meh and with few small exceptions it remained meh throughout the rest of the series where did it go wrong it went from first person story telling to third person we went from seeing things through kamala mind to just the same run of the mill generic story telling we went from dynamic to linear from creative to generic if they kept the whole story in the past tense first person voice then it could ve been good all the way through despite the typical heroes journey story line but it was squandered iman vellani did an amazing job she just radiates joy and that a beautiful thing to see loved her but alas she wasn enough to pull this out of the ashes for me blame bad writing also liked seeing stories representation outside the usual west m not anti western entertainment still love my tropes and white male yank protags don bother me much just think entertainment would be so much more interesting with lots of different cultures and faces so m glad there was tilt at culture that we don see very often at least from hollywood but again the strong start was wasted still better than most other marvel hero introductions but still way behind others ', ' black widow is what call leftover or past over script that just didn have the quality of marvel universe major motion picture first off this movie should have come out after captain america civil war which was released in 2016 and before avengers infinity war 2018 to fit into the marvel universe timeline the cast was made up of some of the best in the business but failed to let the actors and actresses develop their roles why have olga kurylenko play role that stunt double could do hidden behind mask insulting olga professional abilities further by requiring no lines or acting if stan lee had been involved with this production the plot would have been rewritten and the cast more involved in acting clearly this was more pulp fiction quality writing than marvel universe where is nick fury where is ironman seems they pop up in all the marvel universe productions but not this one it is as if they ran out of creative ideas and dug through the trash bin for the scripts stan lee through out black widow leaves me feeling empty like just lost two hours of my life will never be able to get back ', ' one of the worst story ever trying too hard there is no flow in the story it looks like low budget movie ', ' this is one of the most overrated movies have seen m not much of superhero fan but did enjoy spiderman 1 2 and 3 as well as ironman ve never seen thor or captain america so know m missing little backstory but doubt it would add lot to the experience in this movie the story was sub par and very predictable there is also no sense of danger whatsoever since these superheroes are near invincible which is why tend to avoid superhero movies action scenes are therefore boring because you know the outcome 99 100 times laugh at why they even bother shooting guns at these guys do they really expect us to be on the edge of our seats yes the visuals are decent but that not what makes movie when comparing this film to guardians of the galaxy it no contest gotg had drama humor that wasn forced decent story and fantastic visuals if you are marvel fan you will probably like this film simply because you love the characters was looking for something other than mindless action and unfortunately did not get that ', ' m not sure why so many people are saying it was boring or average m assuming it a bunch of nerds that aren happy unless they see some magic or super powers the fight scenes were very well done and it gave me better understanding of black widow history was entertained the whole time ignore the bad reviews and watch it if you like following the universe which do ', ' now m not exposed to comic books in massive way may have read couple of dc marvel and other standalone comic book franchises but never big fan or follower read books but not comics but in case of movies it different love movies the whole concept of movies keeps me alive there are no genre specification for me so it opens your scope in movies it more like my second job so watching comic book adaptations is kind of sub genre in movies follow now m no authority in comic vs film tv series analysis coz like said never was into comics but when you watch so many comic book adaptations you get know them for sri lankan comic adaptations are purely entertainment and daredevil season 01 tv series is pure entertainment netflix originals are amazing house of cards jessica jones luke cage and narcos this is the same now though personally love daredevil 2003 many global fans hate it but this is loved globally and among sri lankan fans due to its both substance and style beauty of it is how it builds on the character arcs with depth and it connection to the plot the action sequences are epic and gets better every episode so the season 01 was an amazing inception for the television series overall 4 5 ', ' lot of people don like it okay get it the main protagonist powers are just cheap plot device the character doesn have good development the movie can be split into two parts no powers and powers the action is cheesy but that is not the point of the movie captain marvel is 90s buddy cop comedy the villains aren supposed to be another thanos they re just hollywood villains so if you want to watch something serious don watch this watch this when your asking for entertainment ', ' there is reason nobody is seeing this trash it is barbie in super suit the opening weekend was disaster with less ticket sales than any mcu movie since the hulk 15 years ago it is running 6 10 on this page and 44 on rotten tomatoes saw it with few buddies at matinee on saturday and we were alone in big theater the movie starts out with some action and foreshadowing statement by nick fury jsut need you for one more mission to capt marvel does that mean the end of brie in this role we can only hope there is black superhero that we met in wanda vision but have no idea what her powers are yet there is little girl who just got her powers but fills the asian block and she is teenager so there is that cute first kiss is awesome crowd they bring in korean prince for no reason at all the second act drags and the final act is let down but the hidden scene will be the reason most come to see the movie it does not disappoint that three minutes are the best of the 90 spent wading through this poopy diaper of movie cannot stress enough just awful ', ' in 2008 marvel studios gave us the first film adaptation of it super hero iron man with the promise of big things to come the film was an astounding success proving that batman wasn the only hero that can have good movie what followed was four more films the hulk iron man 2 thor and captain america all critical and financial successes and all leading up to one massive blowout known as the avengers culminating all five films into one massive adventure was seemingly impossible task however writer director joss whedon somehow against all odds pulled it off in big way it something that has never been done before in film taking these characters who have proved they are strong enough to carry film by themselves and putting them all together in one over arching continuity the problems that could arise from this concept are endless and yet this films works not only does it work it so brilliantly pieced together that it is destined to become the greatest super hero movie ever made joss whedon of firefly and buffy fame is no stranger to creating stories featuring ensemble casts the contrasting personalities of the team play large role and whedon explores this with astounding fervor this is character study as much as an action film and the witty dialogue whedon brings to the table only enhances the personalities of these extraordinary individuals the banter between the heroes during lulls in the action is just as engaging as the mind blowing action itself and the action will blow your mind the main reason most people want to go see this film is to see the avengers kick some ass and there is no shortage of ass kickery happening in this film although the hulk steals most of the jaw dropping moments even the lower tier characters of black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner get just as much screen time and each have their own wow moments one thing that is an absolute must when having such an over powered team like this is having worthy adversary tom hiddleston character of loki plays the perfect villain and what better an adversary than crazed god and his army when it was first revealed that loki was the film antagonist the initial fear was that we already saw thor defeat loki in his own movie so why is there need for the avengers to be involved when we already know thor can beat him single handedly fortunately this and all the other fanboy and critic questions are addressed and taken into consideration since was child have always talked about the prospect of an avengers movie and it looked so unattainable that it seemed like it would forever remain just 12 year old dream having previously dreamt of g joe movie it comes as no surprise when the avengers was announced was left with cautious optimism much to my delight it seems that joss whedon was somehow able to look into my soul and produce the best comic book movie ever made the avengers is masterpiece and should be placed on the mantle of greatness beside star wars and indiana jones filmpulse net ', ' first off let me say that my over all rating for the show is meh 6 but differs for each season season 1 deserves 9 stars season 2 maybe like 5 season 3 man don even know but it really went downhill which is such shame because the first season really was absolutely fantastic the whole cast is wonderful but the thing that think this show should really be celebrated for is the way it treats the subject of sexual assault in movies tv far too often we re subjected to upsetting scenes of women being attacked for the story but that just bs excuse for people who want to see that awfulness it also as the show creator says lazy story telling season 1 artfully depicts the harm that such assaults render without having to force the viewer to live the event with the character this is very important and should not be underestimated ', ' after multiple delays marvel studios finally delivers on their promise to bring forth the new action packed superhero blockbuster black widow black widow has everything classic marvel fan would enjoy yet is easily understood by viewers with no prior knowledge of the marvel cinematic universe behind all the superhero cowls is fantastic character development each character experiences different emotional journey finding themself in an extremely different emotional place compared to the beginning of the film black widow serves as prequel to avengers infinity war shining light on plot lines we had no clue occurred the film picks up right after the events of captain america civil war where natasha romanoff scarlett johansson is on the run from the s government when natasha is attacked by the iconic villain taskmaster olga kurylenko she is led to confront her past when she learns the red room is still functioning kidnapping and training widows she must team up with unlikely allies to defeat the organization once and for all for comic book junkies there is always worry that superhero movies will sometimes be bore because you already know the story so well black widow abolishes this worry with multiple twists and turns that are new to comic book fans yet are very respectful to classic superhero origins when people think of the character black widow they extremely undermine the grittiness of her backstory director cate shortland is marvelous at mixing in natasha dark past to boost her character development and show what drives her day today black widow is one of the darkest marvel movies to date throughout the film rough and sensitive topics present themselves such as child trafficking drug use and suicide the film also includes multiple curse words and many different instances of intense action despite the gloomy tone the film explores themes of family and reminiscence morals are taught to younger viewers demonstrating the message that people can change you just need to give them chance give black widow 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 plus adults you can stream black widow on disney with premiere access or watch it in your local theater on july 9 2021 make sure to check it out reviewed by jude kids first ', ' with all the hype surrounding this movie you would think you were about to see something special well you are not the acting of brie is so cringy that lose interest everytime she is on screen the effects look super the sound is awesome but real movie doesnt need all that you can make 10 10 movie with good story plot actors and directing this look like it stars bunch of robots and was directed by an i develloped at microsoft kids devision read lot of bland and that is the perfect word to describe it bland boring and too long if you give this above 5 stars you have to sjw brie larson fanboy girl because if this is the future of marvel am done just gave it 1 stars for effects franckly because of brie larsons attitude might have gave it 3 stars but she insulted me so 1 star ', ' excellent acting excellent casting excellent storyline ', ' the only good show in netflix marvel series good plot and action scenes and not annoying like jessica jones ', ' only good things in this movie were david harbour amazing performance as red guardian and natasha watching moonraker james bond film from 1979 this movie is tied worst for me with falcon and winter soldier ', ' well the first season was nothing special it started well but there wasn much of plot matty was kind of roaming about trying to figure out this or that but nothing really interesting about hells kitchen crime world except the kingpin who was kind of intimidating well developed character think there was too much of man with the mask and my town which reminded of batman and lets face it when he finally got the costume it was silly looking thing and still is the 2nd season was different more brutal gritty introduced many new characters important ones electra is cool and hot the kingpin scary the punisher rocks and matty well he is still boring after watched the 1st season rated it 6 stars but now m watching the 10th episode of the 2nd season it is about to become 8 star show next step is jessica jones and ha there was tiny connection between the two ', ' wow this show swept me off my feet jon bernthal is the punisher and total badass the writing for the show is fantastic it keeps you reeled in and begging for more as the credits roll it brutal heartbreaking at times has lots of funny moments intense edge of your seat recommend watching season 2 of daredevil first to see the beginnings of frank castle have watched both seasons about 4 times through back to back and am into it fully every time am obsessed ', ' was obsessed with seeing this movie since the trailer first dropped almost 2 years ago the storyline was very underdeveloped felt more like cheesy sitcom then marvel movie scarlett didn seem like the lead the action fighting sequences were rushed and brief they definitely didn develop this movie correctly had alot of potential but very underdeveloped not good movie at all wanted to walk out of the theater after the first 35 minutes ', ' am normaly huge fan of almost every movie watch but really didn like black widow found the story not so fun the action secenes were some good most bad and not much comedy was good taskmaster was nice character ', ' the first episode kicked off the series introducing viewers to kamala world with bright colors rich characters and bit of intrigue am definitely looking forward to the next episode to see her grow into the hero she needs to be ', ' when will marvel finally realise that their formula for producing films is just too much for most people to stomach regardless of that all the main characters here are absolutely interchangeable and colourless there is no character development and the cgi is even worse than in ant man 3 and that a real achievement couldn care less about the three heroines and nick fury character has finally been labelled an absolute laughing stock won go into the story now as it would be an insult to my intellect to think again about the thousands of gaps in logic hope we can now all experience the end of the marvel films together no don need any more films of such lousy quality it just more cheeky that something like this is marketed as cinema film audiovisual quality like this is better suited to the afternoon programme of some tv channel somewhere between malcolm in the middle and the simpsons but by god not on the big screen ', ' only watched this show for kilgrave with out him ll would have gave the show 1 star ', ' from all the tea breaks had to take this movie failed to hold my attention at all ok maybe for few 30 second intervals yes the cgi is good but so are lot of other movies the sound is good but so are lot of other movies none of the actors seemed to have to make much effort probably because the script and plot were pretty much irrelevant ', ' for all the hype the movie hasn amouted to much probably the worst of the current batch of avenger movies ve never been impressed with scarlett johansson as black widow and her role in this confirmed my feeling it a shame emily blunt couldn do the part think she would have been much better even ray winstone wasn very impressive in his role big disappointment all round ', ' if you go into this show expecting anything like the movies you are going to be gravely disappointed right now it at about 5 out of 10 thought the pilot was at times kind of snore fest the writing at times was juvenile at best expected so much more from this show with all the hype and all hope it improves in the coming weeks or it might be taken off my dvr the pacing of the show somehow needs to be changed like the lead actor lot and was glad to see him carry his role over to the show maybe the wow factor is yet to come things need to be explained bit better as well m sure they can get it right with so much to watch on tv will there be enough time to do just that ', ' was really looking forward to the avengers and have to say was disappointed lousy acting samuel jackson who usually reliable was wooden and had no real take on the character robert downey good thing he wore waterproof mascara for his close ups scarlett johanssson who needs to go back to acting school mark ruffalo what was his take on the part he just looked confused and lacked confidence dead spots that almost put me sleep some very cheesy x using miniatures particularly noticeable in 3d lousy photography the 3d glasses made everything seem dark and drab found myself taking them off and seeing much brighter scenes m sure if you re 12 year old sadly m not this movie is the best thing you ve ever seen but there are so many other movies of this genre that are so much better on every level men and the batman series in the capable hands of christopher nolan to mention two captain america padding in his shirts was laughable did they run out of cg because he looked much better in his own movie m comparing this movie to avatar because was also disappointed with that one too as it relied totally on on special effects weak story line to make it success oh well ll look forward to the dark knight rises because know christopher nolan will not let me down ', ' just cashgrab without any substance dumb plot just random fight scenes that have no weight or point to them ', ' movie is first of all full of my favorite actors scarlett johansson olga kurylenko rachel weisz william hurt and david harbour natasha was always my favorite in avengers was sad after endgame as many of us surely its very basic marvel action movie good as any captain america if you haven seen avengers captain america or its been long time then recommend to watch them before see this or after scarlett don even look any older action and story is good enough to entertain any marvel or action movie fans avengers endgame give 9 0 10 but sadly this one give 7 10 7 is very basic points for marvel movie not bad but masterpiece can recommend this to see in cinema am happy that marvel studios return well in covid 19 time to cinema can wait what is coming next enjoyed black widow even when it wasn perfect there is no as perfect movie if you hate this you are free to do so also ', ' am huge fan of the marvel universe and although some of the marvel movies were better then others can honestly say that have liked every single marvel movie until today when made the decision to watch the marvels think that the storyline was strange the characters and acting felt somewhat off fake and it generally felt like marvel just wanted to create an all women cast movie at any price am huge fan of more women in leading roles and loved wonder woman captain marvel and black panther 2 but this was just horrible and ultimately it sets the movement back in my opinion also don mind more middle eastern representation but kamala ms marvel is strange character that just kinda mimics imitates that of spiderman without the flair background or any real powers or at least my understanding was that she gets her powers from her bracelet which doesn really make her superhero guess there are comparative examples in dr strange and ironman but they were super smart and others like hawkeye and black widow earned their superhero status so yeah not my favorite character overall extremely disappointing ', ' it is joy to watch shield especially season 5 have no idea what is wrong with us viewers we africa were almost starved to emaciation of this wonderful show because the us crowd would not watch it thank god they renewed until the disney period which has meant we have 100 access as if we were in the us sadly for now all our favorite h e d agents are probably still on contract but are not on any show what bummer mean these guys made these shows with an embargo on most content as the mcu took all the good bits and they were still able to craft really good show loosely linked to the mcu what wow am make sure this is great south african blacknglish for am pretty sure this is great made sure of my sure what wow what an amazing wow ', ' this is the best of all the shows unlike the flash arrow daredevil with oh m confused oh m in live oh m betrayed let have high and cry not at all here let kick the it out of something it the key the show is violent and graphic but thank god it wasnt turned into wimpy spineless hero its absolutely sickening to say it was cancelled this was proper show how all shows should be instead of the pc rubbish out there ', ' daredevil is soooo good great story great action scenes the hallway fight scenes are so epic the way they tie in characters and plot lines from the cartoon is great this is easily the best super hero show easily one of the best netlflix originals right up there with stranger things and making murderer apparently all the other defenders shows got canceled so glad they kept daredevil just finished season three incredible in the last episode there was part where got out of my chair and started pacing the hallways because was so excited watch this show if you remember daredevil from the cartoon they keep lot of the same characters and plot lines which love they tie them in so beautifully watch this show ', ' special effects action scenes sound humor acting all is great as expected from such blockbusters however dare not expect much in the realm of coherence one can argue that surrealism and fantasy is at the core of the marvel comics experience however some people expect degree of reality to mix with the fiction which is where magic happens and classics are made the enemies that the heroes must face look lot like video game characters mindlessly going about their do harm business for no other reason other than that they are bad the tactics employed by the enemies are laughable and their strategy non existent one would expect more of these enemies especially considering that they are supposed to be so technologically advanced so in my opinion it deserves very high 7 because of the way this is presented and because it can really entertain for one evening just don expect have much to think or talk about afterwards ', ' when show this special comes along can forgive bit of slow pacing it bright colorful and full of life the main actress embodies everything the comic created she is kamala and it beautiful to watch the supporting cast equally did such good job bringing beautiful comic to life it was fantastic example of how comic can be brought to life on television without losing its heart ', ' the writing speaks for itself worse than most fan fiction there is nothing progressive about this if by progressive people mean stereotypical generalization and completely shallow characters then sure this is progressive it also not inclusive it doesn include unique individuals and personalities in fact each character is merely there to represent the stereotype of an identity and not an individual this is the exact opposite of how would imagine most parents want their children to see the world no longer do we have individual personalities but our personalities are decided by our ethnicity and other such representative traits instead of giving the characters names they might just as well have labeled them hot tempered latina strong black female kind and gentle red haired kid crazy and quirky squirrel girl ok squirrel girl might be the one character who comic version is actually much much better than the animated version and of all the characters squirrel girl might be the only one in this who actually has any semblance of individual personality but my guess is because she has giant squirrel tail so they didn know what stereotypical box to shove her in really if you want your kids growing up dumber and seeing the world as populated by representative stereotypes then you will love this piece of hot garbage ', ' guide positives negatives conclusion positives solid performances overall although it perhaps not scarlett best as natasha florence pugh performance was worth mentioning as well she was good in this one unlike most of the previous marvel films this one doesn reflect the serious moments with jokes the whole time resulting in movie with deeper characters and more emotions that why consider the second act to be the best part of the movie well choreographed battle scenes as expected but they can get bit repetitive sometimes negatives it no secret that marvel movies are as popular as they are because of their entertainment value and thought this one lacks that to keep it brief let say that it had pacing issues the mcu villain problem continues taskmaster was well introduced in the first act but poorly handled throughout the rest of the film and the plot twist sort of wasted the character for me very disappointing side villain and the main villain was perhaps the worst part in the movie very generic and not interesting at all the dialogue can be cheesy sometimes and filled with cliches especially in the third act conclusion thought black widow would have served the story and the universe lot better if it was released in 2017 with that said don think the movie offers anything special 6 10 ', ' maybe this was actually good because was pretty excited to finally go back to the cinema but it was better than expected now did have my expectations pretty low but it surprised me the story isn all that great or anything there some good little turns to make it more unique but overall pretty straight forward there are some pacing issues but nothing that drags you out of the movie the action mean it high budget it was bound to be good although some effects looked bit the action scenes are very well organised and choreographed the movie does look nice overall some odd placed camera angles but visually impressive some of the comedy was put in wrong it still got some laughs from the back row the characters are meh there is no real development for the character black widow the development is based around the families relationship now this works pretty well actually their chemistry is enjoyable to watch will say there are definitely some parts that rely on you to have seen the other movies just warning and the end credits scene sets it up for future marvel things as always but don know if like where it is headings overall did actually enjoy this movie despite being so critical ', ' this isn a regular marvel film the characters are wooden the pacing slow the story pointless it has excellent action and fight sequences however without good story it mediocre the villain is also terrible overall poor marvel film ', ' season one of this series was pretty good season 2 well they made it complete garbage am big comic book fan but this series is nothing compared to the comics version of daredevil getting 8 8 ratings for this series is really absurd since season 2 completely ruined the whole series episodes of season 2 were pretty boring as well as they were 50 minutes long felt like really hard work watching the complete episode ve heard how people say how awesome this show is especially season 2 but those people are just marvel fanboys don know how this series kept it rating of 8 8 after that awful season 2 but can assure you it doesn deserve good ratings ', ' iman vellani performance is so endearing charming as kamala she instantly is likable loved the realistic depiction of the family it going to be interesting seeing how her family dynamic plays into her superhero character ', ' enjoy most marvel shows and movies and an some what of comic nerd but this show just does not intrigue or interest me gave up halfway through episode 5 do however see how it may interest others and others may enjoy it it just wasn interesting or engaging to me ', ' boring action boring story boring characters boring movie dont waste your money or time its really bad movie that you just want to end after the first 30 minutes sat through it and regretted it even more waiting for something original or good to happen trust me go watch something else anything just not this garbage ', ' short and to the point loved loved loved episode 1 figured episode 2 on would be just as good don know where they went with the plot but they screwed up the show am at episode 4 and give up dam loved the first movie love the premise more punishing less shitty side stories ', ' pros violent at times not for kids really not too cheesy charlie cox isn so bad as daredevil cons slow scattered story low on suspense repetitive action fights scenes are all the same some poor acting here and there fisk foggy kinda cheesy the show is meh boring at times kinda replays the same scenes over and over hopefully the writing in season 2 gets better overall it is worth watching its not great its not bad but falls little short on being really good ', ' daredevil 2015 matt murdock blind thanks to few acid thrown in his face only to save an old man who was walking down the street attorney at law day becomes vigilante during the night hell kitchen his neighborhood in new york while this is happening there will be enemies who want out of the game let start with the not known but you don want to say mediocre actors charlie cox as the devil in hell kitchen is special when learned that charlie cox is english was blown away his way of acting with regard to their ciegedad very good deborah ann woll and elden henson are two great characters each one is sticking out of point foggy fight with the mafia with the law as their weapon and karen page does so by all means possible but she always wants the truth and two actors that find extraordinary spectacular almost insurmountable vincent onofrio king pin and jon bernthal punisher are two extraordinary actors when found the two are perfect in their respective characters here comes the good stuff daredevil has two seasons liked the second than the first which is not to say that the first is rubbish the first is also very good to place more characters and its proximity to the comics was accustomed to see arrow happiness jokes laughter but in this series everything is dark drugs mafia and fit very well in the series as something normal of all days the daredevil costume is amazing the best have seen because this costume has no effect is real costume not as iron man or superman which are pure effects this no amazing 9 10 ', ' the marvels was my most anticipated mcu project this year the return of breakout characters like kamala khan and the rest of the khan family was an absolute treat they carried the same great family energy from the ms marvel show over to the comically entagled joyride that is the marvels getting to see the reunion of loitenant trouble and her aunt carol was emotional and well earned the dynamic between the main trio was serious at times but fun and whimsical when it needed to be this is very quick paced movie which was nice it didn bore you or drag out sequences it left me wanting more of these characters and their lives but would rather want more than be sick of them can wait to watch this movie again ', ' this movie is the worst movie ever made what happened to black widow make his own movie you know why women can be not superheroes because they weak they sexier and they know is how to cook hate marvel hate marvel cinematic universe and hate movies that count women as superheroes that count when iron man says to captain america yo captain how long are you gonna fart in black widow face because she is so sexy and captain says cuba am going to cuba with meeting fidel castro and say how long are you gonna fart black widow face and enjoying havana cigars and pee his shoe are you gonna tell me about that marvel is enjoying his worst movies ever made just like superman 4 and batman and robin and when scarlet johnson is enjoying his farting hot tub baby ', ' went into this movie with fairly low expectations and some part of me was hoping it would at least meet or slightly surpass them within the first 10 minutes began to realise the absolute train wreck this movie was to be it difficult to describe the amount of issues this film has and don much feel strongly enough about the film that would sit down and attempt to dissect it think to describe it as suicide squad levels of bad would not go far enough to really capture the utter monstrosity this film is but it does point you in the right direction it is borderline unwatchable and is the only film have ever walked out of before the credits even rolled so suppose it will occupy space in my memory and that the best thing can say about it ', ' the protagonist is childish and silly yet demanding the show is full of discrepancies with boring storyline and tons of loose ends the character arc isn developed well in fact most are just pushed out to accommodate the main character family which has resulted in adversaries with neither background story nor purpose ', ' just from episode one adore this show it really has brought kamala khan from the comics right on screen perfectly as reader of ms marvel from the beginning absolutely love the way they ve adapted it to tv all changes included ', ' ridiculous premise ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous waste of time best part of the movie is when the credits started rolling and left the theater glad didn pay for the movie individually have monthly pass so didn waste too much but two hours just write whatever you want have no logic or possible reality there any situation one minute you re untouchable and the next minute you are permeable marvel is just such an unrealistic far fetched convenience of writing whatever your pen wants to out of convenience not any true creativity dc comics rule joker joker joker can wait ', ' finally marvel finally this took way too long even still they couldn go all the way with carol and monica cowards ', ' the best start of first episode it is one of the best taking and the best visual representation episode in the series world could say really stunning looking forward for upcoming episodes can wait to watch them all ', ' they represent pakistan just like the bollywood does adding some clips and songs from pakistan will not reflects it culture would be better if it had been shot in karachi instead of some studio in india forced myself to watch 3 episodes and on the 4th stopped in the middle and will not be watching anymore worst series ever ', ' caught few episodes before seeing any marvel universe movies and it went past me later on after the movies when wanting more of the same fictional world it delivers well although at points it may feel too heavy or too stretched but it perfectly serves its purpose of entertaining marvel filler also main actor the greg guy was familiar from new adventures of old christine goofy comedic faced ex husband so it took while to adjust to him interpreting the tough rough chief not to speak of the episodes where he interpreted the rugged villain but the fact that the series is friendly and takes itself seriously did the trick ', ' based on sana amanat pakistani american marvel superhero kamala khan the series is coming of age story but in context we ve never seen before there talk about the hijab scenes at the local mosque plenty of bismillahs and mashallahs protective south asian parents etc but none of this is self conscious or cartoonish or an existential crisis such as in ramy there also clear eyed depictions of islamophobia police surveillance and bigoted fbi agents but they re all part of what our superhero must vanquish and come packaged with wit and humor the cultural and linguistic references are vibrant and real nazia hassan what and the 1947 partition is at the center of the story love how the lower third in flashback scenes specifies british occupied india ', ' this is very controversial marvel film which seems to be running trend with disney films recently the hype around this film seems to be very mixed some want it to succeed and some want it to fail and both sides seem to have these viewpoints due to various political reasons there seems to be lot of agendas involved do not have any stake in either side because do not care about this kind of thing when it comes to film don think it fair to judge films from that perspective in positive or negative way in the same sense that don think it fair to judge film from positive or negative perspective based on whether or not you like the actors involved don care if films succeed or fail financially film is an art form to me and just want to see films that are well made by people who have lot of passion for their craft to start with things liked there some spurts of entertainment that come from this film some fun action scenes the chemistry between brie larson and samuel jackson was very on point the de aging effects for samuel jackson and clark gregg were surprisingly great the first act overall was relatively enjoyable especially the opening action scene the music score was pretty good and the cat was fun addition but overall the film was very bland and disappointing honestly was hoping for better to me superhero movie needs to have an interesting story well developed characters and it needs to grab me and make me care about what going on this applies to film in general one of the saddest things about this film that was genuinely hoping wouldn have to say is that don think brie larson did good job in this film brie larson is an incredibly talented actress so don necessarily think she to blame for that it might have just been the poor material she was given to work with as the film progresses she gets increasingly more stoic and the film never showcases any emotion or vulnerability towards the character for some reason and her character is given almost all backstory with too much exposition and very little depth and at the same time there isn enough given to make you care about her or any of the characters overall don think she fit the character the performance was very wooden and uneven which is sad to say because you can tell how much passion she giving towards this character the narrative is so scattered that she kind of gets lost in the shuffle they forget to develop her character which was disappointing for me the storytelling was very messy this film is trying to be an origin story connecting piece to the past as well as to what going on now and set up film for what to come later so the film kind of collapsed in on itself because it trying to do too many things at once this honestly felt like phase 1 which is not good thing that not to say that iron man and the avengers weren good it just that this film feels lot like the early marvel films in the sense that it felt like they were still in an experimental phase they were still trying to figure out what works and what doesn work about their films they ve passed that point and they know what works by now so this film as well as all the other new ones should be progressive steps forward and this film was definitely gigantic step backwards they also don do good job making this character feel important or relevant to what currently going on in the mcu we re told she the most powerful character in the mcu but they never show us that or make us feel that way the film is lot of telling rather than showing needless to say the writing and directing were pretty lackluster also the action other than the opening was not very good or memorable at all the skrulls were fun villains and relatively unique compared to other marvel villains but they weren really given any character there was lot of fun 90s references but think the film relies on this as crutch way too much which caused the tone to be very disjointed they have 90s nostalgia for little bit then it feels like buddy cop film with nick fury and then it a story about the friendship between her and lashana lynch character and there no effort given to make the audience feel emotionally invested in any of these stories and since it always jumping back and forth between these contrasting tones and that made the film uneven as result there are some needless explanations for things that happen in the mcu and when they happened it felt corny and forced the film was fun time but this is the 21st marvel cinematic universe film so at this point generic fun action films are old and tired and since there have been dozens of marvel films at this point they need to live up to higher standard so in order for me to like their films at this point they have to do something more than just making fun movie can believe m saying this but dc did it better wonder woman had charm charisma and character development and captain marvel definitely fell flat in this regard again there are moments of potential here but they are hiding under the bland cliched marvel formula it a very generic film that we ve seen many times before not just when it comes to superhero movies and was hoping for more than that 5 10 please see the film though and make up your own opinion on it don listen to what others say don give in to online agendas no matter what side they re on just go see the film make up your own mind and when you do be honest about it because that how we get better films by letting the filmmakers know what works and what doesn work about their films but at the end of the day the fact that this film didn live up to its potential doesn matter and m still very excited because we re in the endgame now ', ' its genuinely soo goooodd all are missing out if you think it looks childish just check it out promise you it one of the best marvel disney plus shows they ve had so far and yes the power change is little disappointing but they make it work ', ' respectably decent marvel movie worth the watch for some past psychological emotional experience since this movie takes place in 2016 the chemestry of is widow family converts nicely in what d believe is realistic reunion loved the portrayal of the father red guardian and sister yelena the comedy was pretty much on point where it was needed and usually marvel movies are too messy with this however the action scenes removed too much off the topping as another imdb reviewer wrote the editor struggled too much with covering the stunt double from the camera making the sequences giving headaches this is probably one of the most unsatisfying movies when it comes to that action though at least have to give them credit for the intro sequence loved that very iconic but they overdid the music as if they had to use every song on the soundtrack in order to not piss off the composer empty and slow sequences are often the build up an emotional scene needs but here they went all out trying to fill in as much as possible but when it comes to the villain where is the intimidation where is the build up we as an audience expected it was so lousily portrayed felt like he was inevitably going to lose with thanos for example we had no idea he was so terrifying because his goals were so clearly set with meaning felt my jaw dropping yet with all these psychological pasts of the main characters that felt like had to be redeemed in some way this villain removes this satisfaction and not to mention the villain powerful minion who is pretty much only used for the action sequences felt like 7 10 was too generous here you go marvel 6 10 love the poster tho ', ' hi readers would recommend to stop wasting your time here reading this review and buy this movie right away could not catch the movie when it was in the cinemas and honestly regret it the movie is not only superb but is one of the best movies have ever seen it will not be wrong if people call it the best super hero movie of the recent time featuring all the marvel comic heroes this one is marvel in itself captain america and stark iron man look amazing in their suits while hulk is much more balanced and thor is his usual self although the archer guy still don know his name was new to me and have not seen him before in any movie but loved his character overall great entertainer which you cannot afford to miss ', ' it was the badest movie of disney im sure if they try it would be so better ', ' went back and forth with the rating on this and honestly on 2nd viewing might rate it little higher so many things about this film worked loved they paid homage to so many future things in the story the soundtrack in this movie was great the chemistry between larson jackson is fantastic the supporting cast all the way around is good the story of this film was good solid twist fun humor and all in all great introductory of captain marvel just another notch on marvel belt also ready for the goose vs rocket showdown ', ' this show is for children but it not very good nothing really happens please get better writers or at the very least please have reading the comics mandatory for writers if this show gets better then will update my review but for now 1 star and that being generous ', ' definitely seem to be aiming for younger audience but the story wasn bad and neither the actors it was bit clich but that reality for most teens with strict parents ms marvel is lot more similar to disney animated movies aimed for children than with live action movies aimed for older audience if you re into it go for it m probably gonna continue watching to see how it develops ', ' 7 10 great to finally see female marvel superhero get her own film and brie larson truly delivers now it time for black widow to shine ', ' guess have to be that guy and disagree with those that talk about what great show this is while bernthal is good as the title character this is very slow series with maybe one action highlight an episode while sympathize with the plight of veterans this show beats you over the head with ptsd story line that seems extremely familiar and why do all of these hero on the run from government killers shows always have to use the trope of the hero visiting an old friend or mentor that is living as hermit and tries to kill him been there and seen that plus the sub plot of the fbi agent trying to find him really adds nothing to the over all story all in all disappointment ', ' whoa where do start the one scene where bilingual came up was pretty interesting who green lighted this dorothy dandrige it cool how they tried to use the kree culture and created very visually engaged experience the bad is am not at liberty to say there really is no reason either because at some point the criticism is not subjective but objective at least men are not vilified throughout so that a plus am very upset that was not able to see this in the theaters even after purchasing it at home am still upset about that one will change my mind that this was meant to see in the big screen oddly enough my wife walked out and which thought was ironic another con is the special effects they were kind of lame at some points in the end the film was fun ride better than blue beatle but as far as marvel comic films go was pretty lame not sure who put this together but you about to lose yo job ', ' had high hopes for black widow to be movie on the same level script acting action grandeur as the early marvel movies iron man avengers thor captain america etc instead we got movie that felt like it had zero connection to the marvel universe at all or like it was made by people who hadn seen any of the previous marvel movies let alone worked in any of the productions the opening plot was exciting for the first 10 minutes but then it fell flat and never recovered imho and halfway through was convinced scarlet johansson was only there to create enough buzz for the others to make spinoff don know anything about the director cate shortland nor do want to find out what other movies she made in the past because this was so uninspiring really poor acting or directing whatever at fault me and my kids have watched all of the marvel movies up to the final avengers time and time and time again which is true testament to great movies but black widow is movie ll never watch again which is shame because really love scarlet johansson when she really into role this was real meh moment d hoped rachel weisz and olga kurylenko would have great parts and really lift the movie but one of them seemed sleeping and the other only showed her face twice and only had one tiny line the only one at least trying to deliver was florence pugh which is obviously set to return in spinoff m putting this marvel film in the same bucket as most of the newer ones you know the extra bucket for milking that cow dry to the bone hoping the connection to the original avenger movies will be enough to print more money but m getting more and more fed up with how these new marvel movies are made and gone are the good unique superhero movies replaced with some cookie cutter often feminist replacements and not good ones either your mileage might vary and ve seen reviews ranging from nil to max so please make up your own mind about black widow but it a marvel movie d gladly had missed despite loving scarlet johansson as an actor because she can be really great with good script and good director know jon favreau is super busy and can make everything himself but if marvel is going to continue making awesome movies we need him behind the reigns or taika waititi for doing comedy variants which gather this one tried to be and failed so hard s the spoken russian in the movie is abysmal despite them supposedly being russians mean couldn they have spent weekend with speech coach teaching them their lines correctly my russian is far from great but enough to make it feel like comedy not an action flick ', ' so much can be said about this series this trilogy of chaos and destruction full of righteousness indignation empathy and pain if you are ready for journey through the depths of human depravity then this is for you the good the bad and the really really ugly bravo ', ' wouldn be surprised if the majority of bad reviews are from guys just like with captain marvel men can stand to see woman lead movie and criticize the dumbest insignificant details true fans will love it and not feel the need to dissect every little thing as if their some sort of movie critic expert ', ' very unrealistic and unbelievable that sniper shot on the first episode what this main charecter has no emotion nothing we dont know anything about the supposed family thats making him this way ', ' love the mcu liked the film captain marvel enjoy the character of ms marvel in the comic books think iman vellani is great casting for the character loved learning about the pakistani culture and history something was missing with this show and after the first 2 episodes struggled to get through the series think the following makes ms marvel weak mcu entry 1 weak villain 2 change in marvel powers 3 very slow plot 4 lack of cameos 5 there was no edge to any of the characters ', ' cause you gotta be smokin something for this god awful show to get rating above 1 jeez talk about deja ing vu it friggin fury road all over again once more hear people ranting and raving about how awesome this is and once more m left scratching my head either the whole world has lost it mind or ve caught the affliction that stan marsh had in that one particular episode of south park for reasons that cannot fathom the daredevil movie from 2003 has become the most hated and ridiculed comic book movie of the last ten years why because ben affleck and jennifer garner were in it because it had humor because it had black man playing the kingpin talk all the trash you want on it you still have to give credit where it due at least daredevil had deep moving and compelling story story that wasn a typical paint by numbers playing it safe story that plagues lot of the current comic book movies today ve liked some of the comic book movies of the last few years but out of all the comic book films from 2002 to 2015 ve only loved 5 of them in case you re wondering here they are 1 daredevil 2 spider man 3 spider man 2 4 captain america the first avenger 5 captain america the winter soldier all the rest in my opinion are just cheap entertainment is the netflix daredevil just cheap entertainment well yes however that not the only reason didn like it didn like this show for the same reason didn like the tv show gotham or the fantastic four films the blade films the men films and the amazing spider man films it doesn feel like comic book there a reason why comics aren realistic they be boring when read comic or book or sit down and watch movie wanna escape to place where the impossible is possible and good always triumphs over evil when m about to watch something based on comic book expect the same thing no more no less to me this show just feels like law order rip off and bad one at that with costumed crime fighter thrown in just for the sake of it if you like this series because of the crime drama feel to it fine to each their own if this series turned you into daredevil fan great but if you haven already strongly suggest you pick up daredevil comic before you watch the next season preferably some of frank miller issues that is if you really wanna understand the core of the character of matt murdock daredevil because this show does not and will not give you that as for me if need daredevil fix ll crack open one of my graphic novels or go back and watch the 2003 film and view it as always have for so many years an underrated misunderstood gem of film which ll always hold close to my heart ', ' there were some twists wasn expecting and the cast did great job will be seeing this again ', ' should of been 2014 movie an origin story that should of been done way before don think black widow is big enough character to get her own movie felt stretched and needed lot of supportive characters for it to even be marvel movie what up the bourne identity camera work not fitting ', ' jeeezzzz people so this movie is worse then some lame 6 star romantic comedy here on imdb your all just in the momentum of infinity war and now also endgame the release of this movie is bad timing yeah you all loved her better in endgame huh boy why would that be had fun movie evening and she cute to watch not problem at all ', ' my son 10 and enjoyed this movie opening night it was lot of fun all the way thru the three main characters played well off each other but miss marvel was our favorite she brought so much charm to the movie and her family was just hilarious to watch deal with mcu craziness the escape scene was hilarious and the oh captain my captain line had me dying with laughter also the recruitment scene parodying fury and stark was perfection btw 23 is totally still child really looking forward to the next 2 phases of the mcu people rating this movie super low just don know how to have fun time and should probably get used to grandparent nicknames ', ' booked tickets for this as my boyfriend wanted to catch it before it left the cinemas and from the trailer it looked like great fun but after very achy backside from sitting and squirming through 2 an half hours of this tripe bored out of my brain just wasn worth it the only good thing about this film was downy jr hes an incredible actor in his own right and if it wasn for him d be giving it 0 10 just cant understand why people are soooo hyped over it very clich bad acting apart from jr dialogue was atrocious and the story has been done time and time before yawn was expecting something sooo much more from this film and it fell flat ', ' this is my favourite show of all time even after watching shows like breaking bad this show is more of my type can express how much m in love with this show my friend introduced me to this show didn know this show even exist and had no interest of watching it because was not familiar with the marvel character daredevil but after he insisted me for long time took some time to watch it just from the first episode fell in love everything is great about this show vincent onofrio is phenomenal actor and easily most terrifying mcu villain charlie cox jon bernthal deborah ann woll wilson bethel elden henson everyone is so perfect in their roles the only thing don like about this show why netflix cancelled this show m pissed off about that at last just want to say thanks to my friend for introducing me to this show and all the creators of this show one of the best shows of all time ', ' this was the worst marvel has done so far it was super boring the story was so dull and so was the characters the acting was not good the script sucked hard no actual villain and magic bangle lmao there are so many things could list here about stuff that bothered me but just can be arsed to do it not worth the time the only reason watched this show was because of my marvel fomo and it did have some important ties to other stuff in mcu marvelwise this was 1 10 the only reason give it 3 10 is because have seen worse and it was also tiny bit interesting to see another part of the world with different culture for change people from pakistan will probably love this show ', ' love the majority of mcu but this literally is the worst second marvel related show film to let me down after the bombshell that of captain marvel the marvel is likely going to be let down too ', ' well m huge mcu fan and deliberately avoided any spoilers for this before saw this was expecting this to be swan song for natasha romanoff and the avengers centric era of mcu finally thought to myself the black widow the only female avenger the world most deadly assassin well maybe next to winter soldier and dangerous spy is finally getting her own film we finally get to explore her backstory and see her kick ass as the main character unfortunately what saw wasn a black widow film it was don know how to descibe it but think of children action comedy focusing on nuclear family like the incredibles but with natasha romanoff set as the big sister the film focuses way too heavily on yelena the kid sister played by pugh and romanoff family which is introduced for the first time in the mcu you have the goofy strong man dad who a washed up loser but has good heart the smart scientist mom and the smart alecky kid sister the sister jokes between pugh and johansson fall completely flat hahaha forced hysterectomy on young girls hilarious red defender played by david harbour was kinda funny but completely out of place so now the soviets made another super soldier besides the winter soldier and the failed experiments in siberia they had their own version of captain america and yet this is the first time we re hearing of it is he lying about knowing captain america or was his aging slowed like bucky we ll never know but then again came too see movie about the black widow not the dollar store russian knock off avengers the red room where other black widows are trained along with the taskmaster and the villain who created them could ve been so much more interesting but they re just plot devices used to show us more of the mcu bad fake russian accent action hero simpsons episode was hoping to see black widow the elite lone assassin with story reminiscient of la femme nikita instead got this goofy family comedy from disney if you stay for the post credit scene you ll realize this whole thing is setup for the upcoming hawkeye series on disney plus in other words the reason pugh gets so much screen time and the kid sister gets so much dialogue is because this whole movie was an advertisement for another show scarjo and natasaha romanoff deserved better ', ' omg just watched the movie and it is just girl version of james bond ', ' avengers assemble is cinematic masterpiece that brings together some of the most iconic superheroes in the marvel universe directed by joss whedon the movie delivers an action packed thrill ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish the plot revolves around nick fury the director of h e d who assembles team of extraordinary individuals including iron man captain america thor black widow hawkeye and the hulk to save the world from an alien invasion the chemistry between the characters is electric and their interactions are both humorous and heartfelt the action sequences are absolutely breathtaking with each character getting their moment to shine from iron man high tech battles to thor thunderous hammer strikes the fight scenes are expertly choreographed and visually stunning the visual effects are top notch and the final battle is an epic showdown that will leave you in awe what makes avengers assemble truly special is the way it balances action with character development each hero has their own distinct personality and backstory and the movie takes the time to explore these in depth the result is film that is not just mindless action flick but true character driven story overall avengers assemble is must see for fans of superhero movies and action adventure films it is perfect example of how to bring together diverse group of characters and make them work seamlessly together with its stunning visuals thrilling action and heartfelt character moments avengers assemble is true masterpiece of cinema ', ' its rare that movie is able to not only live up to it hype but actually exceed it avengers matches the hype surrounded by it and then blows it away this huge scale superhero movie set the bar astronomically high for all other action movies none of which have come close to attaining that height since the avengers pulled together arguably the greatest cast ever to share the screen not only was this an incredible feat based on the actors and actresses but the characters themselves many worried how the movie would stay balanced and give each character their dues but director joss whedon proved it was possible wont get into the plot much as it been explained numerous times and honestly you should watch regardless of what the plot is but with that said the movie centers around group of superheros brought together to stop an evil force loki and his evil plans the movie explores the dynamics of all the characters working as team and how they pull together to extinguish loki catastrophic plan the most intriguing part of the movie aside from the fight scenes are the character dynamics joss whedon does such good job making the banter and interactions between these superheros feel real the snide remarks and off comments felt genuine complement to all the actors involved who took this dialog and delivered the movie is endlessly quotable and everyone will find character than can truly enjoy speaking of the fight scenes they were absolutely fantastic the battles were large scale fought between numerous superheros and army of bad guys there was carnage throughout and it was sight to behold there are even times when there is little in fighting amongst the avengers and it quite treat the avengers was case of every single person doing their job and doing it at the highest standard whedon with his direction downey jr with his cocky demeanor and hemmsworth with his goldiness even mark ruffalo stepped in filled in the hulk shoes nicely could go on and on about each actor brilliance but just trust me when say everyone was excellent if you haven seen the avenegers what are you waiting for ', ' season 2 ruined the punisher for me 1st season made sense the punisher wanted revenge and he got it then came season 2 where the punisher happenstance into dumb situation about lone girl with photographs at dead end bar in tennessee who needs to be saved dumb excuse for 2nd season but at least it something to watch ', ' for self contained movie it was surprisingly fun which is something can say for recent mcu films certainly better than captain marvel they are trying to make her more relatable and real while it does work it feels little forced she very different to the last carol we knew the first act is messy rushed and catches you up on everything before it expecting half the audience to not of seen the tv shows it settle down after and finds its feet landing some good jokes through natural humour not forced ones the third act is good and they are certainly throwing some future setups in knowing this might not performed as well as expected or achieve what they wanted 7 10 not because it amazing it not but for sequel to reletivily contained film that isn trying to be something it not it better than expected think of it in terms of iron man 2 thor 2 and antman 2 trying to build on the last film some things land some things don but you know left there with smile on my face which haven done for mcus last few films bar one ', ' how can marvel keep getting away with 6 different stories going on at the same time with 6 episode format episode one was by far the best of the series and set up the show for greatness then after the 1st episode the show took nosedive off steep cliff very poor episodes ', ' m not sure ve ever seen film release surrounded by so much hyperbole and people losing their minds do understand that phase 4 of the mcu has been pretty poor with so many projects and it definitely lost the relative consistency of quality it used to have just this year gotg 3 was one of marvels best personally thought love and thunder was not that bad pretty average mcu even if christian bale was wasted but ll admit antman 3 was big disappointment that didn enjoy that was stupidly long intro when don have that much to say about this film it was fine not brilliant definitely not the worst film released this year as ve seen it called the most important part of the film which is the main trios chemistry was pretty solid and kamala khan and her family were the highlight throughout having almost all the jokes that found funny coming from them overall the villain was forgettable but not awful the action was ok all round an ok film with some better parts both of the more bizarre weird scenes enjoyed lot and do think if they don land for you that could impact your enjoyment decent bit wouldn recommend to everyone but if you ve enjoyed decent number of marvel films think you ll enjoy this one ', ' variety has notified that daredevil series is almost confirmed on disney and writers are already working on it charlie cox and vincent will be back in the series they have already reprise their roles in mcu like charlie cox in spider man no way home and vincent in hawkeye series ', ' amazing series both finished season 1 was fantastic well written great acting and the action and drama was incredible part way through season 2 now and ve got to say it just as good like both seasons for different reasons and jon berthnal is the best frank castle ever and don think anyone will ever surpass him as frank castle made for the role ', ' punisher season 1 had loads of great action and it didn feel like there was single filler episode because of how enjoyable every episode was however season 2 had great start but did feel the middle was really boring and fillery but once you get to the last 4 or 5 episodes the show is absolutely amazing and is so fun to watch ', ' wasn expecting it to be for kids so that on me other than that if you go in expecting kids show it ok didn find myself immersed in the story much ', ' agents of shield started very rocky some liked its methodical pace in the first season some hated it even though ratings consistently decreased with every season of this show the storytelling and the plot itself improved every year save for the exception of season 6 my personal least favorite season the show started out as piggy on the back of the huge success of the avengers blockbuster movie it brought back fan favorite character in phil coulson the type of storytelling this show could pull off by the time they were in season 2 was astonishing the showrunners were geniuses you were rewarded in later seasons for watching the original season but it didn cost you anything if you didn watch the theme and feel of the plot reminded me much of the movie universe it tries to emulate this show is by far diamond in the rough it never truly got the recognition it deserved and think it deserves greater hype rated it 9 10 as it got off to rocky start but was great series that made me come back for more every week and was overall my favorite show to date ', ' show is nothing more than glorified disney project focus on the good characters that people care about this garbage is wasting time and money that could have better been spent elsewhere ', ' don really understand how is this show has such high rating first season is extremely dull acting is terrible main character spends most of the time crying moaning and writhing in idiotic religious overtones fights are spectacular but all essentially the same things improved only in second season with introduction of punisher and electra who for me became real heroes of this show it became more gritty violent and fast paced altogether not bad one time watch but never more than strong 6 stars ', ' black widow is the worst mcu movie infected by horrible and cringy writing where do begin this movie feels really out of date and completely unnecessary the film deals with her past instead of making methodical movie that breaks down the black widow program and its psyche it does an mcu formula of big set pieces and end of the world stuff this movie barely builds black widow it tries to make her mistakes haunt her but fails they tried to bring more compassion to her with her family but failed the plot in general was never going to work instead of the story being character focused it decided to be politically focused and don mind politics in movies but the politics here aren so well thought out it not only pandering but it straight up bad woman antagonist would ve been better showing what black widow could ve been if she wasn an avenger cold hearted killer the other characters are waste of space in the movie utterly useless some plot wise and some black widow wise the reason why it not so rated low is cause some action sequences are impressive the prison cell the safe house and even scenes with taskmaster should never go unnoticed this movie may not be an insult to the mcu or black widow herself cause there are previous marvel movies that lift natasha this movie is still the worst mcu film ', ' first of this isn as bad as people are saying now it might not be for the majority of marvel fans but it alright for like 12 to 15 year olds it not trying to be anything more than it is and it a simple show about teen girl with super powers and this is the problem with it it nothing amazing ', ' would normally rate this an 8 10 but it currently being 7 10 on imdb after its opening weekend is absurd people reviewing that could not follow it either have never seen captain america civil war and to lesser extent age of ultron or didn actually watch the movie with their full attention it was easy to follow loved that black widow had her own movie especially without love interest it was great to see the main relationships were familial and accurate funny dialogue reflected that thought this movie was easy to follow it took us on trip of one of the many lives natasha lived and her noble desire to do good scarlett johansson was an executive producer and felt like her choices were wonderful her character wasn sexualized and the women kicked butt in this movie maybe there haters because apparently when it a bunch of men fighting it kosher but not when it women hope women superhero movies become more the norm this is and captain marvel which thought was not as great but most origin stories aren show that us women will watch an action movie and feel empowered even if it doesn fit the mold of rom com ', ' don want to sound rude but the show is below average with below average actors didn expect this from marvel atall and the cringe of pakistani culture was unbearable ', ' if you re comic book fan like me you understand that usually superhero storylines adapt more straight serious tone but with the avengers you have the great storyline of superhero film and the comedic relief of banter ', ' since her appearance in iron man 2 wished for standalone black widow film and was wondering why mcu doesn make black widow film rumors say that feige was interested but disney didn give approval some say that it developed after wonder woman success we got it but unfortunately our lead is dead in the main timeline last year it was one of my most anticipated films but slowly started feeling that mcu won be great like before after endgame and black widow proves it right these are the drawbacks of black widow 1 timeline this film would have some impact if it was released after civil war and the post credit scene shown in it could have been added in endgame 2 taskmaster taskmaster is heard to be an iconic marvel villain who can easily copy anyone fighting skills taskmaster addition in black widow made us excited but it turns into sore thumb like mandarin in iron man 3 and nick fury eye in captain marvel twist is revealed in order to evoke some sympathy like winter soldier but unlike bucky who we knew very well in first avenger and due to that we sympathised with him on the other hand we don know anything much about the taskmaster character in order to sympathise with her 3 villain its obvious that mcu lacks strong villains and black widow continues that tradition 4 main character we have seen in some films were the supporting characters score over the main character and save the film it happens either because of the actor limitations or the character here natasha romanoff was overshadowed by her sister yelena belova not just in acting but also in saving the day scarlett johansson is great actress but her character is boring no wonder she wasn given solo film before 5 action sequences why was previously anticipating for black widow was because expected it to have brilliant hand to hand combat mcu film after winter soldier but black widow doesn have any great or memorable action sequences 6 no entertainment black widow doesn have any entertainment because of its dark concept even winter soldier and civil war had dark themes but where thrilling and entertaining but black widow lacks any thrill or entertainment on the whole black widow is disappointing standalone film florence pugh and david harbour are the only saving grace who provide us the mcu entertainment ', ' watched the first episode it is like disney cartoon not marvel series it something that kids under 7 can enjoy watching the effects are so childish and the story eh ', ' season 1 4 stars 1 viewing 6 24 2022 tried this show many years ago and quit after three episodes thought it reeked of network tv quality and that coming from huge mcu fan ve liked or loved almost every movie show and many are amongst my favorites so gave it another shot still mostly feel the same way it a bit cheesy the action is poorly filmed with lots of quick cuts the single story episodes are mostly forgettable was reluctantly continuing through the series with long breaks days weeks between episodes then something happens little more than halfway and surprisingly became mildly hooked was interested to see what happens next and after so many episodes became invested in the characters thought wasn going to make it past season 1 but now m curious and hope they are able to continue that intrigue and excitement season long this time season 2 5 stars 1 viewing 7 16 2022 definite step up from season one somewhat better fight scenes ward is awesome some really great moments but there is still bunch of dumb stuff things that don really make sense you have to turn your brain off at some parts and it still significantly lower than the quality standard of the mcu the finale is awesome though and m more excited to watch season 3 hopefully the elevation continues season 3 5 stars 1 viewing 8 2 2022 more of the same it mildly enjoyable but can say it good same issues as before some parts are pretty awesome while others are stupid it spikes in episode 17 which consider to be the best episode of the first three seasons the conclusion is solid but certain emotional moments didn hit me at all season 4 6 stars 1 viewing 8 22 2022 best season so far it has most of the same problems but few things made this season stand out one is the inclusion of character couldn believe was on this show also shocked didn hear about it two is the heavily sci fi story and themes and three is the strong last few episodes with good escalation leading to the climax season 5 3 stars 1 viewing 10 29 22 oh man this season was tough to get through the previous ones took few weeks this one took over two months was reluctant to watch episodes it more sci fi stuff but for some reason it wasn grabbing me it felt cookie cutter and weak but the worst part is the amount of dumbness and illogic it through the roof and it not just small things here and there it major story changing things most have to do with when certain characters do and don use their powers so many times something can be easily solved with powers but the characters don use them and there is so much inconsistency with how the powers are used and what they can do character is severely injured when the basic premise of his her powers would not allow that to happen we ve seen many instances of that same scenario playing out the other way it makes zero sense there is also some extra cheese in this season some of the emotional moments work but many don and there might by the most cringe kiss in the history of time it hurt me to my core was audibly in pain and there is one story point involving something that may or may not happen to character depending on the result of the conflict it not addressed either way which is pretty crazy to me even if it explained next season it doesn make sense not to have it here season 6 4 stars 1 viewing 11 11 2022 was really into this season for while in guilty pleasure way was really enjoying the storyline with termi coulson or coulsonater but the last few episodes feel so typical and there are the usual issues with things that make no sense and lack of logic with using powers season 7 3 stars 1 viewing 1 7 2023 haven finished the season but needed to post this quote from mac that perfectly summarizes it laughed when heard it none of this makes any damn sense we can understand it for while this show has seemed like it making stuff up as it goes along but this season takes it to new level after writing the above paragraph stopped watching for while finally forced myself to finish it it just not good it all nonsense had to turn my brain off and just go with it there not much left to say while it had some decent moments this show is bad ', ' hj benjamin as archer works because his voice is cool and fits the character personality jason sudeikis sounds and acts exactly like he always does which doesn work for this role the show is cool but he was horribly miscast most likely because of his popularity in ted lasso ', ' worst marvel show ever till now have watched 3 episodes its just boring slow nonsense weak story worst actors except father bruno don want to continue further recommend to skip this series what was director thinking while making this its just kill my mood for future marvel shows feels disgusting ', ' the marvels is just an all around bad movie the script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed which both have an impact on how well the characters and in turn the actors come across on screen the action and humour are kind of alright and the vfx are definitely better than anything we ve seen in an mcu project since doctor strange in the multiverse of madness with the obvious exceptions of guardians of the galaxy vol 3 and loki season 2 but that still doesn exactly make it look great this movie is just painful to watch at points early on it has some really fun moments and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining but that feeling vanished as soon as it came it barley better than ant man and the wasp quantumania so you can do with that information what you will ', ' hit monkey is really clever at its length but dissapointing at character development and animation frame although animation style is average not present new ', ' the marvels in it forced attempt of overt girl power unfortunately produces forgettable story whilst weakening every character that appears in the film the tone as is so frequently the case with mcu films released around this time is infuriating as not scene goes by without weak comedic value being forced throughout this constant humour removes the audience from the plot or action as all gravity of situation is lost and relatability non existent seriousness is taken from larson subjecting her to quirky female lead ill fitting to the power of the character vellani uniqueness is lost transitioning into peter parker type with added squeals rather than remaining the great character of kamala khan introduced in her series parris rambeu unfortunately makes very little impact painfully jackson nick fury becomes lesser character with each appearance in the mcu as he is continually pulled into the weakest releases at least shroff is greatly refreshing again villains particularly ashton lead of dar benn are uninspired and the kree as collective are wasted at least matching what was done with the kree in secret invasion everything off world is losing it impact and whilst there is clear positioning in the timeline the films placement within the wider universe is tough to establish as nothing is memorable visually it a little disappointing with special effects looking far from sharp criticism increasingly being aimed at disney the marvels is meant to be fun as evident by the musical planet which will be insufferable to most surely but m not sure who this film is pitched at its not funny enough or at all to be comedy yet has enough humour to distract from the action and is packed with sci fi logic which isn particularly engaging through no fault of the three leads who just work with the context they are put in this is bad film ', ' black widow is an entertaining enough movie for marvel fans but doesn raise the stakes or add much new or interesting to the fold aside from some new characters that were introduced at this point in time you know what you are getting from marvel above average entertainment that is ultimately pretty forgettable but fun because everyone else watches it and its fun to talk about some of the characters here will surely tie into more events going forward and disney is still doing good job of keeping the universe consistent and playing off other shows movies to create good overarching story ', ' wrote the date because right now there is nothing but awful tv shows on so went back and watched the 2nd season of daredevil and now starting the 1st and end of the punisher got so sick of all the bad shows had to come back and watch these one more time before they are pulled from netflix dexter is my fav show of all time but the punisher is very close second love this show ', ' understand that marvel tries to make each series hit different audience however it is difficult for me to locate this type the production is completely censored with blood and black humor colorful fairy tale scenery from bollywood can go to girls at the age of 13 but not to adult viewers simply this series is not to my taste ', ' faced with an existential threat posed by asgardian renegade loki tom hiddleston nick fury samuel jackson assembles team of earth mightiest heroes including ironman thor the hulk captain america black widow and hawkeye robert downey jr chris hemsworth mark ruffalo cgi chris evans scarlett johansson jeremy renner respectively loki plan revolves around possession of the tesseract the same glowing blue macguffin that plagued captain america in his debut solo film captain america the first avenger 2001 the disparate team of egos and alter egos meets squabbles reconciles and finally cooperates as the skies open and loki chitauri army attacks the big apple all of the heroes super and otherwise are well played and fun and tom hiddleston is excellent as the conniving loki the overall story is entertaining and the film especially the climactic battle very well made all in all good start to the complex story arc at the core of the popular and profitable franchise ', ' before watching this movie d seen some reviews of critics and after that hadn much expectations from this movie but it surprised me this movie is way much better than expected although admitt the villains didn leave much impact had really good expectations from taskmaster and they started with that character really well but didn use it effectively in the end it was kind of let down other than that this was really good movie ', ' this is absolutely the worst mcu movie ever the story is awful the storyline is mess the directing is lousy tries way to hard to be to many different things thor4 was trash by far the dumbest movie in the mcu but the marvels was far worse marvel is trying to hard to be everything for everybody but instead their ending up with shallow simplistic garbage that no one enjoys maybe the 5th stage of movies will be an improvement because if they don get any better marvel might be going the way of the dinosaurs marvel needs to quit trying to hit it big with the indie directors go back to one that understand the heroes their stories ', ' yes just referenced the horrendous tv show from the 1990s that h e d leading lady ming na wen starred in after about ten minutes of watching skinny actors who look like models try to be badass and fail completely lost all hope for this show skip forward to the end of the first season and have to ask why bother watching wen scowl and try to look hardcore has become laughable and the show other leading lady chloe bennet has mannerisms that smack of teenage drama queen which makes it that much more cringe worthy when she has lines meant to make her seem super intelligent clark gregg is the show only redeeming element and even he seems frustrated half the time not the character but the actor his lines don have any of the weight or wit they do in the movies and it hard to watch him try to make such boring writing interesting all in all for me it was impossible to get over the forced and unbelievable acting the show feels more like b reel from the 90s that would air on the wb than leg of the mcu wen bennet and especially brett dalton acting basically ruin any redeeming qualities the show might have gained now going into the second season casting has always been huge factor in whedon shows and this show exemplifies complete miss in that department not only are the characters contrived the actors who play them are almost always sacrificing authenticity in the name of trying to look tough on screen can recommend this show to anyone especially if they re fan of coulson otherwise 4 10 ', ' disney is milking the cow but the milk is bad just like the book of boba fett disney is loosing it the magic is gone and as last attempt they go with race and believe that just sad ', ' it not really clear to me why this film is so highly rated here there are only two things to recommend it spectacular special effects and the acting of robert downey jr and most of the rest of the ensemble who make the absolute maximum out of the material all kudos to them for their fine performances the main problem for me is with the story which is absolute dross what the hell is going on with the flying aircraft carrier for example yeah it looks great on screen but in terms of logic there is none why are the giant bugs so intent on destroying or dominating earth why are there these scandinavian demigods running about when everybody knows these belong only to norse mythology and not to the real world could go on but won bore all of you who are no doubt going to retort with lengthy explanations of all the ins and outs of the history of the fantasy universe this all arises from however viewing this as stand alone film without knowing the extended comic book background the events in the film however exciting don make much sense m sorry m not superhero buff admit it hate superhero comic books but seriously none of this guff makes any sense m sure robert downey jr would agree if he wasn cleverly making fortune out of the iron man franchise give me intelligent sf any day ', ' in the beginning watched this show for like 10 minutes the first episode was soo booring stopped watching it and then after few months read some reviews saying the same thing first episode is booring but from second episode its awesome and as season by season it improves am glad started watching it ', ' this is is the first mcu series that have had to completely give up on after the first three episodes ve managed to sit through the rest in their entirety the acting plot and characters are simply empty and lifeless like cheap imitation of spider man homecoming after nearly 3 episodes of pure nothing an unconvincing sinister plot emerges and another group of poorly acted generic characters with it as with eternals more dross the focus here is on inclusiveness political correctness and very forced and obvious virtue signalling as with eternals there is no sign of well developed antagonist villain the protagonist is actually likeable and convincing in the part and with some semblance of plot screenplay and decent production and direction may have actually pulled this off as it stands any actor portraying ms marvel would have been unable to salvage this mess unlike spider man homecoming the family are multitude of superflous characters who get way too much time in front of the camera and who contribute next to nothing to the plot it brings the whole thing down to soap opera level and no one watches mcu for that the friends of the protagonist are similarly pointless characters who are slotted in at certain points in vague sub plot which you can only hope may be going somewhere only to discover yet another pointless tangent shoe horned into the story in order to put across some message or point no idea why some are giving this 8 9 10 ratings thought falcon and winter soldier and hawkeye were all steps down in quality compared to wandavision and loki now they look stellar compared to this offering disney clearly see mcu as cash cow which they will shamelessly milk for all it worth ', ' don watch all these marvel films ve seen probably 5 of them only seen the first avengers one of the captain america films iron man 1 2 venom think that it so maybe if had seen more of them d appreciate this more but honestly they all feel exactly the same same formula same action same humour don get the appeal really and this was no different does anyone actually care about this story or these characters thought it might be pretty good james bond type adventure or something but it just the same old turd obviously don know the characters well because don read comics or obsessively watch all these films but m struggling to see why anyone would want to watch 50 films that are all the same ve seen 5 of them and they re all the same so really what the appeal is nobody else getting bored of this marvel formula yet ', ' m 26 and when presented with show based around highschool struggles m typical not interested gave the show shot after seeing cast interviews and how excited everyone making it was the hype is comepelety warranted it a fun wholesome show also getting to learn about south asian and muslim culture through the lens of kamala has been very interesting ', ' don understand why this film gets all the bad and negative reviews yes it not winter soldier or the latest thor film but it a good time and funny in parts film just because it can hit the heights of other marvel films does not mean it a bad film it not amazing nor is it awful it stands up with dr strange and ant man is that such bad thing ', ' unfortunately the decline of marvel movies continues there hasn been anything good labelled marvel since infinity war and the marvels doesn change thing who is this so called movie even for 4 year olds it tries to be funny and fails it half a55ed slapstick at best the actress that plays the kamala girl is unfortunately not that big of talent and to add insult to injury suffers from bad dialogue writing she babbles and rambles supposed kids teenage nonsense it is truly unbearable besides that there are unnecessary annoying characters in your face slapstick singing and dancing anyone else who hates musical episodes lazy and uninspired look backs to what has supposedly happened between captain marvel and this piece of junk if you must give this chance fortunately this movie is super weak from the beginning so that it won take you long to realize that it better to skip another marvel movie yet again ', ' about halfway through the first season and not sure how much longer can take it the fast forward button is getting used more and more often blame the writers this season could have been told in 8 episodes or less every good writer knows that every scene has to accomplish several thing at once the two most important being character development and advancing the story this show repeatedly gets bogged down in character development 5 minutes of two guys talking about guitars and how they met their wives that has nothing to do with the story or plot so it just sits there dead in the water don get me wrong loved the killing which is also glacially paced but at least they managed to maintain some tension if they re planning second season they better hire better writers who understand the basics of storytelling ', ' the punisher is great action series with an adequate plot you know after the first episode what your going to get so dont go looking for shakespeare season 2 features young actress who is believable and raw talented and think this show will be stepping stone to kickstart what may be promising future ', ' the first three episodes are pretty good unusually intelligent for marvel movie that passes very fast some episodes are extremely stupid even for marvel and the series gets worse the longer it lasts even if that seems impossible these are new dimensions of limitless stupidity to call the last three seasons scrap would be flattery ', ' wtf this is probably the best superhero show ve ever seen well written well filmed well acted plus rosario dawson is in it and she one of the most beautiful women of her generation then add deborah ann woll who wish she was red headed still is probably equally beautiful both actresses are amazingly good at their craft even the young version of murdock is really strong can not come up with any complaints and m really hard to please old curmudgeon hope they make more episodes next season because this is hardly binge viewed show gimme more gimme more gimme more stupid imdb demands more lines or they will not post line line line line line ', ' light hearted fun and little silly imam vellani gave it an energy that been lacking from some of the newer mcu films will it change the world and undo all the phase 4 damage no but is it fun and an easy albeit convoluted watch yes the three marvels getting together was fun all channelled though ms marvels infectious energy and actually made bree larson seem fun the run time was good too at only 1hr45 the villain was poorly cast with no charisma and didn really care for her plight if you liked ms marvels the think you ll enjoy this she has great future in the mcu ', ' total waste of time it better watch panchayat session 2 which more than 1000times better of this marvel kachara during watching this realised it better to watch pogo ', ' too much of stress on identities around kamala khan and not on the character of kamala khan looks like regular tv sitcom as an actress iman did wonderful job bright future ahead other actors were average at best also lot of political undertone and references which could have been avoided ', ' an inspiring and amazing movie with great messages amazing characters stunning vfx lot of emotional development captain marvel is the hero we need strong and powerful hero who inspires and shines brie larson is perfect on the role ', ' the good was truly impressed with how well they pulled this movie off the visual effects were all very clean the characters were portrayed by the actors very well this movie was loaded with action keeping everyone attention glued to it was so impressed went to the theater to see it more than once and recommended it to everyone was very happy to see most of the actors return to portray their characters in this the bad most characters the hulk was my big issue here mark rufflo was good with the bruce banner character but the graphics for the hulk just did not meet the level of the movie starring edward norton but it was not so bad that could not look past it and really find enjoyment will most definitely go see another installment of avengers ', ' marvel is repeating the same formula in the last years it not difficult to predict every single scene in captain marvel it all predictable wasn surprised in any moment good special effects weak plot don worth the ticket just wait to see it on tv ', ' the first season of jj was brilliant great villian epic scenes even her storyline other marvel characters flash forward to s3 and its pc garbage the big issues have is its so blatant its like 50 of the population is gay they take stabs at 45 which is odd cuz this isnt even the same universe they make men seem like they are dumb ones it was show that had great promise but got worse and worse each season ', ' after nearly two years since the last mcu movie we are presented with black widow the first feature length entry to kickstart phase four was pretty much looking forward to the movie perhaps because had incorrectly assumed it to be the origin story of black widow and it seemed to be an interesting premise since we only ever get hints of where she came from in the previous entries the result is bland movie disappointing movie with plot that has zero stakes random characters and ultimately just feels like set up instead of full fledged story the first problem have is the plot it set between civil war and infinity war we know what happens to natasha romanoff during these two movies and don recall romanoff mentioning the events that happened in this movie in infinity war this essentially makes the plot of black widow feel like what you may call as sidequest in video game it highly filler and to be honest it doesn even feel like romanoff is the main character here since don think she experiences particularly life changing here the main focus seems to revolve around florence pugh character yelena belova who plays romanoff sister sort of in the comics belova also assumes the mantle of black widow so given that romanoff character died in endgame you can guess what the purpose of the movie is what else drives the plot the villain after string of top tier villains such as thanos hela mysterio black widow main antagonist represents terrible regression it an amalgamation of the mcu worst villains reminiscent of malekith bland boring no charisma no presence generic and pretty low iq there the taskmaster essentially person in suit of armor that not even that advanced and another villain who supposed to be this elusive mastermind who hides behind the curtains but turns out to be pretty lackluster considering that by this time frame romanoff faced and lived through the likes of loki ultron witnessed aliens and the might of superheroes like thor vision it hard to believe that the taskmaster will pose threat to romanoff there are some side characters here was interested in david harbour character red guardian who was supposedly the soviet counterpart of captain america but he turned out to be insignificant in the movie and did not particularly stand out which is pretty disappointing since he supposed to be super soldier yet seems incompetent throughout the whole movie rachel weisz character is also pretty generic rounding out roster of characters that feel uninspired save for some flashes of charm from florence pugh the action sequences were also pretty subpar the scenes in the first half of the movie were decent as they didn rely too much on explosive special effects that filled the whole screen so got the impression that it was pursuing the style of captain america the winter soldier however that gradually changed and the climax was ridiculous action sequence which while large scale did not really leave an impression on me this is pretty disappointing entry in the mcu considering that the last string of movies they churned out while they may be formulaic were solid black widow stumbles pretty heavily could respect it more if they stumbled while trying to deviate from the formula and create something quite different but felt this was pretty lazily crafted movie that only served as set up for perhaps the growing mcu it doesn really provide anything new and by the end of it you don get the feeling that you re able to connect more dots across the different movies in the saga it essentially an unnecessary plot thread here to hoping that marvel can get back in the groove with its upcoming entries ', ' well marvel is on the same track again just another space story wonder if they made contract with nasa or something because now these days marvel makes only some random science fiction space stuff anyway captain marvel is back she is now teaming up with her two new friends and they decide to call them the marvels well it like calling the justice league the dc very weird because after they made the name everyone knew what they were called even if they never declared it anywhere in the movie what m trying to say is that it was many incomplete materials that they should have worked on on runtime with one hour and 45 minutes think that it was surprisingly short for marvel movie and the story was very rushed they went through the story with few breathing breaks and moments were you could think they should have put more time to think and develop the story some more but when they used the time on action have to admit it was very great the transportation concept were the trio teleported every time they used their power was fun thing to watch another fun thing was the sweet kitty that could eat people with tentacles it was cool that they mixed that ironic type of humor in here the visuals were good but not always in the smaller battle scenes the effects were esthetic and clear but when the heroes went full power the effects were too exaggerated and looked from my view very cheap and fake the characters were fun the marvels trio was acceptable as the main characters nothing wow but it was fun to watch their friendship connection nick fury performed by samuel jackson was great experience he played humorous ironic but keeped the serious face on and he did his job right the villain that popped out of nowhere was the downgrade of all of this she felt like something easy to fight wasn menacing enough as villain should be and didn have rememberable face or something that could make me recognize her the final act did have too much of everything but ended with very interesting cliffhanger that didn expect going nearer the conclusion just got to say that it no difference if you watch it normally or in 3d of course it is little effect with the 3d glasses everything is deeper and more three dimensional but for the actions that are going on the screen it doesn change much after my todays experience at the theatre but have to admit was entertained for long time so overall this was an ok movie got few incomplete parts and feeling of rushing but in another way it was fun and got some interesting concepts that was new for the marvel universe ', ' first of have to admit had really high hopes from this show and when it comes from such power house of marvel you should be well turns out marvel can and has delivered for what we all have been waiting for this drama shows us that how violent corrupt brooding and dark life can be around someone and that one man can surely make difference whether it from within or without the boundaries of law the main attraction of the show is that its mature its surely not suitable for children but targeted at adults with all the blood and gore and the political undertones it has the show really fleshes out the characters both the protagonist and the antagonist charlie cox and vincent donofrio has really made solid impression on me the kingpin of crime shines in his full glory in this show and donofrio has made it more realistic and complex as the story progresses vincent donofrio was born for this role as he makes it worthwhile to root for the bad guy even for someone like the ruthless and cruel as wilson fisk some other side characters such as foggy gives us the comedic relief and ben urich rosario dawson bob gunton and wesley gives us some really power packed performances the fight scenes are realistic and excellently done the plot unravels gradually but takes hold of you and charlie cox shines as the devil in these awesome show if the future tv shows are like these from marvel then am even ready for movie one thing for sure that punisher moon knight and other street level heroes deserves to be on netflix at least as supporting characters ', ' it five stars for me and was feeling charitable maybe am in the minority but enjoyed captain marvel unfortunately the things that made me enjoy it aren present in the sequel the movie is all over the place very hard to watch an overly convoluted plot real hallmark of recent marvel and dc comic book hero movies largely to their detriment with cookie cutter action all the action sequences have been done before and better there were no major set pieces that really stood out to me on the acting front brie larson did what she could with what she was given which wasn a whole lot to be honest same goes for samuel jackson as tired looking nick fury the rest of the cast were just bland even though the marvels was shorter than your average marvel film it was still huge slog for me if this is the marvel standard going forward they should just stop quit while they re only little bit behind ', ' title says it all season 1 is far better paced and focused than season 2 d say the first 3 episodes of season 2 are the best but once the plot moves back to new york its just 8 episodes of characters having mental breakdowns about billy season 2 is overly stuffed with villains and has tangled jamble of plot that doesn fully unravel itself until partyway through the season d say you aren missing much watching season 2 but season 1 is very much worth your time ', ' this shouldn be marvel series way too childish give us proper superheroes with proper backstory this is just nonsense knon they want to expand their universe but this is wrong way to do so ', ' it sort of flashback storyline natasha at the end took of for the skies scarlet johansson was in tremendous shape and you could by her outfits that she had 5 6 body fat ', ' an amazing marvel series hope they work for solo movie in the future ', ' it not gotham and it not dc but it ok marvel still did good ', ' was pretty excited for this movie but this is way below than my expectations the only reason give it 4 10 is florence pugh she was brilliant the story of the movie is certainly not up to the marvel standard and neither is the villain which appeared barley in the movie ', ' have no clue what some people were watching but captain marvel was fun and action packed movie brie played the character very well and maybe the only gripe would be she wasnt quite reckless enough neat twist great soundtrack and just an overall fun movie now cant wait to see her in end game ', ' probably would have enjoyed this as 10 year old boy or at least the grizzly action which admittedly is rather well done the drawn out dialogues would have bored me senseless as an adult initially found the slow pace and lengthy dialogues unusually intriguing for the comic book genre but these quickly began to seem out of place when set against the sheer stupidity and improbability of the repetitive plot the quality of the acting ranges from average the main protagonists to downright bad notable bad are the two useless sidekicks foggy and karen their existence in this series other than for bit of infantile comic relief is mystery to me by episode 6 in fact felt embarrassed and slightly nauseous every time they made an appearance in fact it was episode 6 the lengthy saga of the immortal russian that signalled the end for us if you re curious watch it and see for yourself but be armed with massive dose of suspension of disbelief why only 2 stars well might have given it 3 or 4 but wanted to compensate for the ridiculously exaggerated current rating of 8 7 seriously question the sanity or integrity of those who ve give this drivel 10 10 stars unless of course they re all 10 year old boys who enjoy lengthy meaningless dialogues ', ' m all for diversity but this is preaching to next level overdose of religion and super annoying this was good opportunity lost in trying to ponder over too many thoughts with no clarity and direction very disappointing the characters are hamming their lines no pun intended ', ' keep wondering who the hell is writing the scripts example hero got rifle and spies body snatching alien at 20 meters do the hero headshot the enemy nooo he goes fisting the said alien and gets his body snatched and so on and so on not just bad atrocious ', ' it so tragic that the best bits in this film are literally the bits shown in the trailer big disappointment also really kinda random mean all these people we never even hear is before lol jokes ', ' the patsy walker character wasn really done justice they added the token colors of her marvel costume that was it hellcat was an avenger defender in the comics netflix really isn doing these characters right by underutilizing source material clearly they could use writers with broader longer vision incorporating the material available they need to pick people who simply are more knowledgeable on comic book history ', ' it is the top 3 of marvel projects in its entire history the cast is magnificent especially carlie cox and vincent donofrio season 3 is based on one of marvel best comics born again the story born again is not traced but it will not be repeated for the series that marvel studios has announced for the future daredevil born again it is the best marvel series without doubt ', ' ugh 5 out of 10 special effects aren everything it seems on this movie marvel spent too much money on cgi rather than spending that money on other qualities for example better development of the story quality of direction movie pace character development better camera angles etc epic music in an otherwise mundane scene just to make the movie more appealing doesn work that well epic music in epic scenes that how it should be there are many good moments and for that the movie deserves respect and some rating but the bad moments balance those out so really we are just left with some disappointment feel that marvel could do much better but maybe didn bother hence 5 stars little improvement would get this movie to 7 stars for sure ', ' it just not good and feels for 8 year old girls it corny and the art style was actually cool and unique but they stopped doing it feels cheap and you can make young teen girls show good that 30 year old men like myself would watch simply to being apart of the largely story and mcu but it just not good ', ' but isn good the cgo is really bad and the story too d like but expected more ', ' m 10 years old and thought miss marvel was really fun she is really inspiring thought monica rambeau was good when she did some thing at the end for her friends and it was really good movie it was the best movie marvel had in really long time it was fun and inspiring and it was like just really really really really really really good it is probably my favorite marvel movie in long time and really like it highly recommend it um my favorite part was when your captain marvel danced it gets little confusing at the beginning but it overall the best marvel movie in really long time really hope you guys enjoy it a e positive attitude changes everything s watch once upon time on disney ', ' this movie was the perfect team up movie and was as great as it could have been everything about it is just great it has compelling villain with good motive very entertaining and exciting story and fantastic acting by nearly everyone we see this was basically the perfect end to the mcu phase one and an overall fantastic movie 9 1 10 ', ' wonder how much money was wasted on this film probably enough to feed the hungry in one country alone cheesey in parts formulaic in most frances pugh scarlett johansson and rachel weisz carried this badly written story that had so much cgi it had tombraider game feel ray winstone part was written from some 6 yr old comic and unlike the women he didnt carry it off m sure the pay was worth it hopefully between frances and the other two they can put their money behind beter script next time ', ' wow this movie was disappointment for all of us did not expect to be this bad it felt like the move was done by amateurs and was rushed the worst marvel movie till to date story line was horrible and the entire move felt it was cut paste at places the cgi felt like it needed much better work they could have used better writer and director most of the marvel movies would go and rewatch sometimes but this movie didn even want to watch it till the end this is exactly why am loosing interest in marvel movie the end game ended it all except the loki series which was amazing ', ' was waiting for the end the scenes were so basic doesn compare to the other marvel movies at all so lame wish it wasn so generic and bland ', ' this film had moments liked like any banter between rogers and stark however there was lot more issues with the disjointed comedy unoriginal plot and predictable story beats overall preferred the others films better ', ' expected better from mcu movie really liked nat since she appeared in mcu and she deserved better probably the worst mcu movie yet ', ' the special effects are pretty good which falls inline with good story and great acting great series to watch all day ', ' third act is disaster cant believe what saw that scene with car and that was fun scene loool worst scenes in entire mcu history bad cgi soap opera acting troglodyte villain idiotic script etc etc whole twitter canceled dorff but he was right about this one this was garbage 200m budget for this give me break lol ', ' this show is lazy and cringy the narrative is broken nonsensical and just plain embarrassing it honestly seems more like cheap cringy nickelodeon show for kids more than anything else it a shame because kamala khan is honestly great character ', ' don know what people linked in the movie the action starts pretty late almost 1 hr into the film action sequences pretty common based in city streets as seen in few other movies though little comedy by hulk makes action scenes bearable one other thing why would the army build by loki be of aliens thats funny right why will be the person claiming to be god have an army of powerless aliens with guns and spaceships the first hour of the movie is bit drag and feels like the director had to try real hard to put things together to make some sense which totally did not and after that what the movie offers in the second hour is not all that great to have waited 1 hour to get to that ', ' almost fell asleep in the cinema watching this and wanted to just walk out at some point but decided to remain in the hope the it would change for the better one of the most boring marvel movies out there with an uninteresting plot ', ' awesome superheroes and excellent script as well for an action adventure film the script was extremely detailed and that what appealed to me the most ', ' can say without doubt this show is phenomenal in every way imaginable from the dark gritty and realism atmosphere to the intense fighting cinematography this series delivers in all senses and makes out to be great adaptation to the man without fear character that which the 2003 film starring ben affleck failed to do so this show introduces the atmosphere we have never seen before in the marvel cinematic universe all actors perform exceptionally well especially the characters of matt murdock and wilson fisk played by charlie cox and vincent onofrio this show truly delivers ', ' unpopular opinion this show turned into senseless inconsistent lazy written plot holed soap opera ', ' this series is the best series in marvel better than loki and the panichar and its story is understandable and can be applied in our reality the action scenes are very wonderful and it also made me look at king bean in much better perspective and made me see king bean as one of the best villains in marvel and also preferred him over penguin in dc also think that charles cox played the role of daredevil much better than ben affleck and also liked that selected story unlike marvel stories currently also think that this series would be better if it remained under the management of netflix and not disney ', ' this movie wasn terrible but definitely below average m not blaming brie completely for this but the scenes with her were almost always awkward and felt forced feel she was terribly miscast for this role she seemed to act better in other films so think it was combination of writing and acting issues the other main issue was just that everything was bit too easy and not gradual at all for carol went from being ordinary to being completely overpowered and infallible in moments there were very slight tones of sexism towards men in this film which is common for lot of films to have bit of sexism but some of it was bit too noticeable in this case especially after the obvious agenda from media defending this film you almost wouldn be surprised if carol or someone else started talking about mansplaining after some of these scenes rotten tomatoes will refuse to post my review after 5 attempts over month yet they allow the 5 star review bots to flourish let see if imbd is manipulating the narrative as well ', ' after the appalling fatws tv series and mess of finale in wandavision had high hopes black widow would be return to form or least be half decent affair sadly it was not to be when taskmaster was announced as the villain couldn help but be excited yet turned out to be yet another pointless villain it only just over 2 hours long which is average for movie now yet somehow it feels too long the action is just ok the acting is largely passable apart from pugh who is outstanding steals literally every single scene she in but for me she was the only highlight of the whole film m becoming nervous for the marvel future for the first time they need to freshen up their approach ', ' ve never written review on imdb before but today is the day this is great film simple excellent performances between the leads with superb chemistry throughout it funny fast and filled with cool action sequences watched it with my wife who is not invested in the mcu but loves film and she was full agreement sadly this movie is clearly being down scored for what can only assume are malicious reasons d strongly advise anyone to take the chance and the 95 minutes of the running time to decide for yourself will certainly hope that these characters continue to form part of the future plans for marvel ', ' will keep it very brief major letdown how could they mess up so bad they probably wanted new approach on the marvel anti hero but missed by far the best punisher run in comics is the max one from garth ennis that the rendition want to watch the intrigue was sooooooooooo booring geeezz the action is at the most 1 2 10 the dialogue long and not interesting and yeah in some episodes we see punisher telling jokes yes that right the punisher is telling dirty jokes what garbage just watch the last 2 episodes that where we get some explosions shootings and hand to hand combat that the reason gave it 2 for the last 2 episodes ', ' hot mess with flashes of being ok the writers director producer whoever the heck was in charge made the enormous mistake of assuming that everybody had watched all the marvel stuff streaming on disney otherwise you wouldn have the foggiest idea who some of these people were d watched some but not all and still had trouble keeping track carol destruction of the intelligence supreme got explained eventually but wasn clear until 2 3 of the way through the picture the movie kept switching tone from being serious to having some pretty funny bits herding cats indeed all three main characters deserved better movie than this very very disappointing ', ' first of all d like to say that like joss whedon style love his dialogue the unique words he comes up with and most of all love the interesting characters he creates of the new shows in 2013 this was the one the most looking forward to knew it would be whedon show and was expecting bunch of interesting and original characters and was looking forward to getting to know them what you expect from tv show like this is variety of personalities some of them getting along others not so much while all of them more or less complete each other so imagine my disappointment when saw what these characters were like the only difference between them is what kind of geek they are you have the science geeks the fangirl geek the collectibles geek the desk loving geek and the socially awkward geek don get me wrong ve nothing against geeks have geek side myself but you can make show such as this when your characters are so much alike mean you can obviously but it wouldn be very good one personally found the show as boring as it can get if they are lucky they could ride the popularity of the avengers for couple of seasons but the bottom line is ton of wasted potential ', ' season one was excellent season two was worse than dental surgery as usual british person is the bad guy so formulaic but since dr who david tennant has been revelation in most of his work he was excellent in this season one cannot stress how bad season 2 is it was like falcons crest met battlefield earth without any good bits am dreading to watch season 3 ', ' storyline dragged not as good as having luke cage like the first season killgrave was smart and witty now in the second we have to deal with the airheadeness of trish what going on with marvel netflix at least punisher was awesome the defenders was so so and don even get me started with the iron fist guess not all can be like daredevil ', ' the characte building the emotions and the the payoff haven been this good in years iman vellani and crew have me more excited about the mcu than my most anticipated titles from the past two years don listen to the haters this show is the real deal ', ' after an okay ish season 2 breath of fresh air was needed to make the series best again needled to say the devil of hell kitchen has spectacularly brought his show back on track daredevil season 3 is easily the most entertaining installation of the series it has easily stepped up to the standards set up by the 1st season and in fact it has gone even further beyond everything that was loved about season 1 is back with bang murdock third year on small screen is darker grimmer less hopeful and hell of lot more brutal than you can imagine the only thought that is coming to my mind even day after watching the entire season is can season 4 come out now do have laundry list of things that loved about the season but won be listing them because know will end up giving truckload of spoilers all am going to say is that charlie cox has again slayed the role of matt mardock to be honest this season matt is quite different from all his other appearances but that hasn stopped cox from playing the character in the most perfect way imaginable also all other main characters have been given really good storylines and justifiable screentime this is the particular reason why this season is grand hit just like the first one unlike season 2 where the main characters were neglected and lot of potential was wasted on setting up spinoffs this season has gone back to the basics and has sky rocketed to succeess so yeah daredevil season 3 is by far the best comic book adaptation show have ever seen it a must watch for any and every comic book fan ', ' when they first announced this film was super excited for it as love black widow and love her character from the comics and wanted to see nat black widow in her own movie finally so the trailer dropped and it looked interesting as they were talking about the red room which is very key to black widow in her comic book storyline and was like we finally going to see her connection to the red room and the brutality she had to go through so this got me hyped and excited to see it so finally the movie came around and was ready to see it and had real high hopes for it my god wish never had high hopes what train wreck of movie that was like completely pointless completely pointless and not needed if you are going to make black widow movie do it about her origin and the red room that is what every fan wanted to see her origin in the red room but disney was like no let not do that let make pointless film set between civil war and infinity war which story and saga is done and over it was pointless and nat wasn even the main character in her movie it was yelena then red guardian then nat like m not even joking yer it a watchable movie and it marvel but it a terrible send off to black widow and that makes me terribly sad ', ' season 3 is amazing wished there were more episodes binged watch the entire season excited for season 4 ', ' m big fan of superhero movies but lately it feels like some are just riding the superhero wave bit too hard was into this movie at first but when they all started singing had to tap out it one of those films that assumes you ve memorized the entire superhero universe including all the characters from every movie and spin off series honestly there are so many of them that it hard to keep track and don have time for that and then they throw in power swap which just gets on my nerves after while and can we talk about the comedy get it humor is essential but now it like they re trying too hard it used to work when it was subtle and dry delivered by the right actors but now it just too much almost forced miss the darker vibes of classics like christopher nolan dark knight and zack snyder take on superman and batman m also craving simpler classic story structure something that doesn require me to rewatch bunch of previous movies or look up explanations on youtube why the obsession with multiverses and complex plots sadly this movie falls into the same category as recent superhero letdowns like the last antman thor and flash the earlier versions were fantastic but it like they lost the heart of the story in the latest ones it feels like they re trying to please everyone by throwing in too much and in the end it just messy jumble my armchair advice keep it simple ', ' like mcu marvel cinematic universe all movies and latest black widow movie is too good and scarlett johansson acting superb and thanks to marvel cinematic universe releasing so many movies in this year and iam much awaited for doctor strange in the multiverse of madness movie ', ' just watched daredevil totally awesome then punisher quite good not as good as daredevil to get the full picture jessica jones is on the menu but wasn looking forward to it never read the comics by hack bendis and read things here and there about the show but hey let give it shot opening tune is already annoying narrative voice annoying leave that to mickey spillane characters why don you 12 minutes in and already dislike the title character ooooh she a tough one drinking and having that disinterested tired behaviour yuck 20 minutes in and yay there the first lesbian couple luke cage yet to come oh golly it will be another show ticking off all pc boxes what fun made it to the end and gave 1 star for effort now will watch some more but m afraid ll not make it to the end of the series as this 1st episode was utterly total crap ', ' so the first couple of episodes start off with some action but it isn long before the storyline gets sucked up with telling story and completely neglecting any action so far with the marvelflix superhero and use the word superhero very very loosely only season 1 of daredevil delivered in both story and action could forgive the casting of joe bernthal as the punisher if the storyline was pumped full of action and exciting but it isn the punisher is strategic thinking gun toting unstoppable one man war machine who tall strong and athletic nothing like bernthal or the character we re getting this is so frustrating that they can never get the simple things right why choose an actor who doesn resemble the character and then worst of all blow the budget on non action melodrama masquerading as super hero series it not as if it requires any sfx he doesn fly shoot laser beams or throw cars sorry marvelflix but you ve let me down again big time ', ' black widow was dead to begin with this being prequel and the character fate already known there no peril here so what does that leave action sequences that are by the numbers some token character backfilling fairly mundane performances by all the cast and some cringe inducing politics johansson it has to be said is ageing and tired looking we know that she can give nuanced performances and is particularly strong at reactions but as the lead is given no opportunity to do so here still she has presence and carries the film barely florence pugh bring personable performance and some surprisingly appealing chunkiness she also gets to deliver the only real humour although the single joke is overplayed will she be able to carry the inevitable sequel m not convinced but disney will ensure that we get to find out rachel weisz gives her usual solid reliable performance and it nice to see hollywood casting female leads in their 50s ray winstone hams it up decently as baddie baddisov in the couple of scenes that he gets but he only there to embody toxic masculinity the over rated david harbour plays his usual fat bumbling slob and provides some fairly tedious comic relief in scenes ripped off from the incredibles before of course getting smacked around by girl for that matter the final action sequence is swiped from the start of saints row 3 and there not lot of originality to be found elsewhere it rips along at decent pace and it perfectly competent but only competent the score and sound effects are overblown as is annoyingly common now there nothing fresh or surprising or brave or clever here and the politics are so predictably in your face woman good men bad or incompetent of course but casting half the widows as african russians is bizarre delusional and jarring even by hollywood standards it watchable enough but it feels very contractual filler piece to close out the mcu and introduce next generation of younger cheaper talent ', ' don know what others are complaining about am on 3rd episode already loving this maybe for some its difficult to watch people from other race but not for me it good that we are finally seeing the true side muslims which hollywood and media hides from us 10 10 3 ', ' think disney must have hired couple of hundred people to fill up the internet with glowing reviews because this movie is not worth all the online awesome best movie ever quotes m seeing everywhere when give it 5 out of 10 think m being generous was bored and disinterested at least at 2 or 3 different times in the movie so waste your money if you want at the theater but suggest you wait to see it at home at least you ll have couch to fall asleep on to get through the middle part even the actors seemed disinterested captain america had no passion the king loki character was awful mottling feeling sorry for himself no fight mean come on he supposed to be king bruce banner was flat flat flat at least when he turned into the hulk he had some passion ', ' guys now we have got new super hero from marvel daredevil fighting sequence cant explain that but if you are marvel fan you must have to see it screenplay all thing liked in movie ', ' performances of scarlet johansson and florence pugh is just amazing the story has fillers and some unnecessary scenes which try to carry emotions but fails the 3 disney shows released prior to this move set the bar so high that this movie fails to reach audiences expectations looking forward to what florence pugh yelena bring to mcu ', ' how come marvel agreed to put their name on such poor series poor storyline highly confusing series between hindi english and urdu speaking characters no consistency and ending is worst please avoid viewers from this series and hope this character is not added to avengers ', ' as comics fan there was nothing wrong with it it was even spot on with body issues young girls have doing an awesome job and can wait for episode 2 ', ' at first wasn super into it but realized it was aimed at younger generation and it made the show better it had good heart and definitely isn as bad as other reviews on here say it is 1 the high school storyline allows the younger generation who have grown with kamala in the comics they changed things sure but marvel has changed many comic accurate details in other heroes 2 the difference in faith and culture was interesting as someone who doesn know much of pakistanian and indian that is explained by the partition as well as the parts of the muslim faith it was cool to see these aspects it may not be 100 accurate for some people but even the slight representation is still nice we saw murdock in daredevil fight with his catholic faith so again getting more representation is nice touch 3 it is fun it isn super substantial and the stakes are low some plot points don add up but when do any of them marvel has done good job with this and don let the comments against wokeness stop you it isn 1 of marvel content but it is good and deserves chance ', ' at 20 min spy cuts open the abdomen of another girl disemboweling her and her shirt is little damp no blood on the ground nothing oh god just stupid pointless pg 13 clap trap but it ll still earn 8 billion dollars sigh ', ' not very good story and just bad plot same old marvel story stop the badguy and dont let them control super soldiers ', ' if you had watched all marvel movies think about to watch marvel tv shows like this my suggestion pleased don watch this bored season look like the super hero with no super power very very bored seasons if you wait for when fight come and super hero win than your dream take 13 bored seasons to achieve that at least add some vfx that audience love to watch your bored season its boring to see 13 episode you think that some thing interesting come but you disappointed superhero always beaten by villains ha ha ha what impotent superhero if this tv show people make marvel movie than their movie definitely super flop movie disappointed on marvel why they make such disgusting shows in the name of marvel and superhero does marvel forget the meaning of superhero ', ' as fan of marvel have been waiting for movie of this magnitude for years am relieved that this movie wasn released years ago because it would have ruined the hype for this one this movie in terms of visuals directing plot acting is all on point was little skeptical with mark ruffalo as edward norton replacement for the bruce banner character but he did not disappoint there are comedic scenes that are appealing to people of all ages and some scenes are just so jaw dropping that you can only hope for whats in store for avengers 2 iron man 3 paramount has found director that can make billion dollars several times over with the marvel franchise ', ' m watching the pilot now it is unbearable the acting is sub par the plot and progression are rushed it feels like flip book you never actually get to take look at the individual pages beyond the form however the story suffers from one fundamental problem it uninteresting also for some reason broadcast networks always feel the need to put mediocre background music behind everything and mean everything action dialogue transitions interpersonal relations epiphany scenes etc it creates total disconnect with the audience never allowing the viewer to fully or even partially identify with the characters the cgi is below average as well especially for broadcast network if you aren going to green screen right don do it at all understand that the whole shield concept is supposed to involve future tech but the number of implausible inane gaudy gimmicky gadgets that are employed sing only one tune compensation and feeble attempt at that the movie was pretty good for what it was but this is an awful attempt at cashing in it seems to me that abc is targeting demographic e the groupies that they hope will overlook the numerous shortcomings of the show for the fanfare surrounding the genre just another poorly executed procedural ', ' stop overthinking it this was fun movie in the spirit of the original ant man movie so much wonder and joy over their powers and abilities usually agree with the mcu fan masses on reviews but not this time marvel spoiled us through end game with such variety of movies that brought funny and dark all together people expect that in every movie now instead of appreciating the individuality of each movie would have liked more character building and story from this movie but again say it was building block like the first mcu set of movies with original ant man thor ironman etc am ready for more marvels ', ' pumped excited mighty happy and satisfied these are just some of the feelings got right after watching this incredible movie driving home from the cinema talking about it commenting are favorite parts while storm is brewing over us it was like thor himself was watching proud of work that he and his superhero friends have done this is much more than summer blockbuster much more than popcorn flick this movie has point it is the culmination of everything that happened from iron man through captain america it starts with bang it ends with it it action packed funny and will keep your eyes glued to the screen for 143 minutes special effects are top notch beautiful simply incredible and if you choose to watch the movie in imax 3d you re going to shake in your seat but effects are just that this movie features an amazing cast they fit together so nicely everyone got just enough of screen time everyone motives explained many will again say this is not that much of an art it just lot of explosions and fights between superheroes but it is so much more you just have to see it to believe it me being sort of geek waiting patiently for this master piece since it was first announced and since nick fury first appeared in the post credit scene got what hoped for this is must watch ', ' it definitely one of the worst work of mcu request other mcu fans not to watch this it a big disappointed bad actors script writing screenplay etc ', ' was little skeptical at first but what great show can believe it been cancelled what stupid move ', ' carol danvers returns in movie that never really has the heft to feel essential but also doesn have the levity to make it good time as with many of the recent marvel movies an bland space villain wants some bland space maguffins and so our hero must step in to save the day the first 15 minutes or so is little confusing but there is enough exposition afterwards to just about get away with it the star of the show is without doubt iman vellani as ms marvel who is delight every time she on screen and probably saves the film from being bit of turkey brie larson and teyonah parris who supposedly have the emotional arc of the story are kind of drag in summary just about worth watching for ms marvel ', ' movie was alright other than the villain dude was so weird and pervy and his motivations didn make sense and kind of ruined the entire movie after learning about this dude went back to start and skimmed through and the fact that he had all these serious soldiers employed for his pervy schemes was ridiculous it kind of works if you don know the villain and their motivations but once you do the movie becomes joke that takes itself too seriously ', ' no words to explain wish could rate it more that 10 just get out there fellas an watch it super awesome movie till now in hollywood industry combination of all super heroes and they are fighting as united against loki this concept was very touching also the graphics and virtual of the movie just rock highly recommend you to watch it on 3d the film has live to its expectations nice work marvel and its crew and caste no words to explain wish could rate it more that 10 just get out there fellas an watch it super awesome movie till now in hollywood industry combination of all super heroes and they are fighting as united against loki this concept was very touching also the graphics and virtual of the movie just rock highly recommend you to watch it on 3d the film has live to its expectations nice work marvel and its crew and caste ', ' the series is mainly for children with very bad graphics far lower standards than what marvel has accustomed us to over the years struggled lot to complete it only saw it because it will somehow tie into the rest of the marvel universe but won repeat it again get serious and increase the age limit of your series you start to lose it ', ' you must watch this movie this is too good and very string story loved it will also ', ' ms marvel is just another entry into what going to be long list of mcu content that we are not allowed to dislike otherwise that means that there is something wrong with those who do that we re somehow villainous as marvel and disney continue to hide their various ideological priorities behind the guise of story telling and not even all that well for those who can see past the transparent veil pretentiously trying to fix every single culture except their own in any case ms marvel is authentically boring and inspires absolutely no excitement this show is bland and ironically though very colorful boasts an extreme sense of dullness know brown girl being superhero should be enough to have me doing cartwheels similarly to why we are expected bullishly so to love cw supergirl and batwoman because mean why else would this show explicitly with chunky dose of cunning casualness mention how kamala is brown girl right but sadly as it turns out sarcasm there is slight possibility that prefer almond brown girls more sarcasm so get it right next time marvel and disney even more sarcasm ms marvel is another flat addition to the mcu series installments with mediocre action at best actually the action in this series is all the way uneventful and lifeless lackluster lead though have no problem with iman vellani it just that her portrayal of ms marvel is as generic as they come an uninteresting and uncompelling hero plot twists that twist about as much as block of wood and are just as intriguing and don know m just trying to have aspects about this show to draw from but it really didn leave much if any impression on me ms marvel though it has no excitement stakes tension or high level of engagement and is to some extent an arduous watch is not bad suppose or maybe genuinely feel like m not allowed to dislike this show but it not good either it is simply representative representation represented in representational representation 5 10 ', ' love it one of the best series from marvel television best action best acting amazing comedy love it wonderfully amazing loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it ', ' it started off pretty good pretty strong but towards the end things really started to get pretty over the top and hard to believe could have been lot better movie if the creative choices were bit lese ambitious ', ' sooo not funny soo unfunny bit boring and not funny best part the litter girl that sang and the prince really sooo not funny sooo not funny this marvel phase is mess believe is still in the blip after thanos marvel is mess is shamful that is why everybody is wising that iron man captain america and black widow were back but this movie is sooooo not funny and is sad since the first movie was sooo good some fight sequence are good though reminds me of the last movie of thor that was mess too soo not funny too so hope you guys can get back making good movies ', ' what punisher he got more beatings than anyone the series was to be called punishment for punisher cute main actor but he got too beaten up for the main character too bad too brutal but no sense ', ' the main character interactions and comradarie was cute and fun the family was cute and fun the movie itself had many interesting aliens and spaceships and fights and what not cool technology had to read two wikipedia articles during the movie to understand the movie watched the other two marvel movies that had captain marvel but not the tv show was just not knowing the background of what was going on it felt like missed five movies to understand what was happening but didn miss anything it was awhile ago that watched the first marvel movie though though could understand what was happening it felt like walked in 3 4 into the movie or something like lot happened already and m coming in at the end that the feeling of this movie though it was very understandable even though wish we had more background on how the technology worked and technology of the aliens as well and just now background on the aliens and more understanding of marvels abilities and why all three marvels for that reason it sounds corny but they maybe should have come out with prequel to this movie or started this movie with recap like once upon time etc it made me more curious on the universe and everything though liked the group dynamics of the movie but it made it so there wasn a main character and you didn really get to focus and get to know one character very well either there a lack of intimacy and feelings of empathy with the screen for that reason ', ' this movie could not accept what it should be spy film just spy film would have been enough but it also had to marvel movie and when these two things collide experience becomes more and more irritating with each passing minute because the movie can not commit to neither one of these things ', ' watching all these marvel shows has now become like doing an assignment the quality of all these shows seem to be getting worse and worse and meanwhile they fail to secure the quality of their movies either as long time marvel fan just don like the way they are doing it now stop being so eager and greedy ', ' bloody conspiracies just the way the punisher should have been betrayed stays true to the comics ', ' in the netflix series marvel jessica jones is fantastic and brilliant series it is about woman named jessica jones working as personal investigator when jones was teen her family got into brutal car crash that killed her parents and her little brother after the car crash jones was adopted while dealing with the drama between her new sister trish and mom she found out that she had certain abilities that made her stronger than the average teen when jones got older she tried to become person that used her abilities for good one day when she was doing good man named kilgrave seen her kilgrave unfortunately had abilities too but his was mind control he could get people to do what he wanted kilgrave wasn the she superhero he was more of the super villain that fell in love with hero jones after all the bad he made jones do she eventually go immune to his commands and felt it was her job to take him out but only with the help of friends and loved ones like luke cage and trish love this show because it has wonderful story line and it is full of drama the story line was great because it like you never lost interest and you always want to know more also because it wasn just your typical marvel movie it was like story about regular person that just happen to get certain abilities because they were used as an experiment that went bad but in way good jones doesn even want to be known as hero in fact she is the total opposite she is always drunk never shows her feelings towards anyone and lives in crappy house that don even have proper door on it the drama of the show is what also makes it worth looking at it a big love triangle jones loves trish and all her neighbors that she eventually becomes close to but instead of saying it she treats them the worst and protecting them is the way she shows her love she also meets man named luke cage which was one night stand but it turned out to be the last person she killed husband and the only man she could see future with then there was kilgrave kilgrave loved jones so much that he didn want to control her he wanted jones to love him on her own the only thing is that he went about it the wrong way he tried to force her to love him by killing others with this great story line and endless drama netflix series marvel jessica jones is wonderful and brilliant show to see ', ' watched the entire series hoping it would get better alas that didn happen if you can get past the bad acting and guirella noises that frank makes all the time and just enjoy unrealistic shoot ups you might enjoy this worst marvel adaptation to date 2 10 is generous ', ' with this dribble it wasn anything like any of the other marvel movies it lacked excitement it lack suspense just plain bad all the way around blame the writing and the director when hiring actors make sure there is at least some measure of chemistry between them brie larson looked uninterested and it wouldn surprise me if she declines to continue the role samuel jackson was shadow of the tough authoritative nick fury were accustomed too the other actors were so bad they don deserve to be mentioned by name will say that zawe ashton was down right pathetic in her defense it was probably like the others gross miscasting if this wasn the worst marvel movie to date it definitely top 3 ', ' it has already been written over and over and yet this movie is bad another unnecessary example of marketing gone awry so many bad ideas no story cheesiness to an unbearable level awful taste by the ton nothing we haven seen before thanks to marvel but on an another level and that introduction to possible sequel had me shivering in horror please do not make sequel please marvel enjoy your money and do retire please disney enjoy the tax break from writing off the insane money invested to buy marvel inc let us close this sad chapter of the history of cinema rest in peace and do not come back ', ' though started with high expectations jessica jones completely failed to grab the attention that daredevil or marco polo achieved going to point out some details of it the story does not seems compelling what been the aim of the villain to love or to kill or both and many times the scenes jump without any reason within 14 days support group makes drug addict normal person the group is created and then broke down within the 14 days makes no sense significant lack in details prisoner who just killed parents are still wearing makeups the guy who does not need to leave decides to leave and then stay without any explanation and many more to be honest this is one of the worst netflix have ever seen ', ' once upon time had imagine want to see some marvel heroes in the same movie finally my imagine is real now thanks marvel there was an idea bring together remarkable people so we needed them they could fight the battles that we never could ', ' just no seriously how was this made who sat there and said yeah this is good let release it everything about this movie screams no the cgi looks worse than if youtuber did it in their basement the writing is more cringe than if 3 yr old wrote it black girl power wow just wow whoever wrote this has no idea how to make strong female leads look at aliens tomb raider scream all incredibly strong female leads with actual character building not just focus on their skin and think that amkes them strong the whole thing was pathetic and its time to end this garbage it offensive that they think people or so dumb and fickle that they would even consider making this the audacity is mind boggling the audience deserves better ', ' honestly don know what was worse the constant missed execution of forced low hanging humor or the lack in depth of any character to make you care about their wellbeing whatsoever watched it in full theatre and the audible gasps and laughs of 50 somethings and teenagers alike both made clear whomst this film was made for m fan of multiple marvel films m fan of myriad of action films m huge fan of brie larson and ben mendhelson and would have loved for marvel to make strong female lead character finally but this was just atrocious pandering to an audience that knows or wants no better shame it has even close to 7 on this platform ', ' don even know how this series even lasted for 3 seasons it was so boring and slow that regret wasting my time with it not even single thing caught my interest worst series ever ', ' season 1 one the the best tv series ever for comic books it creative legendary and copycat of batman with sprinkles of violence soason 2 comes the over wrote moral questions mid season episodes were dragging slow and we could shorten mid episodes and get better season season 3 the same as season 2 with skipable at least 3 episode and will make the season enjoyable ', ' started off ok but the entire first season can be summed up in the following way heroine catches sinister villain but won kill him despite knowing he is very evil and must be killed because of all the innocent lives he has ruined villain slips through her fingers repeat over and over that it too mono dimensional and not enough material to be dragged out to 13 episodes this should have been wrapped up in 3 to 4 episodes ', ' first off am sad to see people being nasty about this series over the fact its girl and she muslim get life people that said am giving this series an honest review based on the show itself the actress does great job for sure and the effects that go on are really well done but in the end this series is targeted for teen girls sort of how hawkeye was so if your not teen girl you probably will find the series boring cringe and forgettable her powers are sort of also unforgettable they are your typical powers you have seen with other superhero stuff again not saying this is bad series it just nor your normal marvel series that is made for everyone will say though if you are deep into the mcu lore you should watch the series because the importance of ms marvel is going to play big role later in the mcu won spoil how of course you may need to know her story for the future myself gave up on it near the end of the first episode ', ' the punisher is just as fast paced action packed as the first the overall storyline was engrossing definitely causing bingeing to occur as stated really couldn stop watching my only complaint would be how long im going to have to wait till s3 okay that the fact ben barns was still too pretty to be jigsaw but other than that this would still be great watch for anyone who enjoys action packed movies let me add jon bernal does outstanding portraying this character imo is the best punisher by far never have been quite as interested in watching any of the others before him kudos jon keep up the phenomenal work ', ' being used to the humor in marvel movies like iron man and avengers found myself surprised to see marvels answer to dc watchmen the darkest and bloodiest superhero movie know of and how did daredevil do let me tell you this weekend has been roller coaster barely any breaks between every movie like episode of this dark gritty violent and bloody marvel show you don even have to be superhero or comic book fan all you need is to appreciate well written characters great atmosphere as well as nearly perfect plot and choreographed fight scenes this is exactly what ve wanted from marvel in long long time also if you like arrow and or flash this will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat there is no question marvel daredevil is my new favorite tv show based on comic book watch it you won regret it ', ' it was inevitable that the avengers would be made especially with the cinematic gold that was produced with the iron man franchise thor and captain america though the hulk films have struggled to find any kind of footing to speak of in this critic opinion the individual productions dedicated to the aforementioned superheroes ranged from spectacular to borderline dreadful was especially disappointed in captain america to think that any one person could somehow blend all of these characters story lines into something coherent and as implausible as it seemed genuinely entertained made me more than skeptical but as the saying goes never say never the avengers is spectacle to behold it thrilling funny and actually musters up quite bit of unexpected character development how about that what makes it so fantastic is the fact that nearly every major player is given equal screen time wisely whedon decided to paint these otherworldly heroes flesh tone that is he makes them entirely human instead of being fodder for cgi carnage which paradoxically they are in very good way we become invested in them as individuals they have their problems and never is this more relevant than when egos collide aboard floating fortress scene that almost sees the would be saviors of the world nearly tear themselves apart another well played decision on the part of whedon was to play up the sociological angle of the mayhem taking place specifically the fact that the battle for humanity eventually moves to the streets of new york city evokes feelings directly reminiscent of the 9 11 attacks this strikes particularly vulnerable chord in most of us even though it been 11 years since the horror of that september morning unfolded general sense of unease still permeates our contemporary culture the fact that the avengers draws such clear cut lines between good and evil makes it unexpectedly powerful and the musings by many of the characters that the world could do with little old fashioned reverie is certainly well founded one actually have only one gripe with the movie it probably too minor in many people eyes to warrant mentioning but in light of the myriad accomplishments that define the movie simply can ignore it specifically it has to do with the hulk sudden ability to control his rage in such way as to be mindful of what he is and isn smashing no explanation is given as to how he able to do this in hairpin moment of critical importance and it something that could have been easily resolved with quick bit of dialogue or thirty second scene for everything that could have gone wrong with the avengers it a miracle that it actually watchable actually it a wonderful piece of cinema not to mention one of the best action movies that ve ever seen if you haven checked this out be sure to do so before it leaves the big screen skipping it would be doing your inner kid heck your inner human great disservice ', ' this is great one shot that marvel made with beloved character the writing is solid for the 10ish minutes that it is and the action is spectacular too atwell portrays carter with such confidence that it is hard to deny she is capable agent it is nice to see stark too keeping up with continuity that he was one of the founders of shield in light of continuity it is hard to gauge when this one shot takes place or if it is even canon after all it could take place after season 2 of agent carter but it is hard to tell atwell writing and action stark and shield hard to tell where in the timeline this exists or if it even does final score 8 8 10 ', ' how would love to have championed joss whedon for this but alas no the avengers is not great movie avengers is boring movie ok saw it in 3d the only other film ve seen in 3d was avatar and this may also indicate to you m not movie snoot rather thought avatar was ok unlike many who say it awful you would be right therefore to infer that the novelty of 3d hasn exactly had chance to wear thin on me yet let just get the 3d out of the way for me it was like watching holographic projection very unreal often there were only 2 maybe just 3 planes of focus and sometimes this made the focus too oddly focused g wobbling briefcase in the foreground that looked like something out of toy story also some of the action with johanssen is frantic cgi cartoony acrobatics and in 3d this just looks even more of mess anything but exciting was cautioned not to see in 3d that person was right the print isn compensated for by the darkening effect of the glasses think it affected me too eye fatigue plus the combination of how those glasses make the film so dark plus major major flaw in the film caused me to give up on consciousness and spare my eyeballs more than once yes in 3d at least this film is too dark to see what going on detail becomes elusive and the 3d focus only allows you to see one or two parts of the screen everything else is often deliberately way out of focus this makes the film visually uninteresting especially for us autistic background viewers and the major major flaw oh might have already let that slip this movie is boring surely can be so bored that easily by film ve never seen before it impossible avengers yes there some showy effects that may impress those that can get off on over 2 hours of blam blam blam but me yaaaawwn honestly was expecting to enjoy the avengers especially since kinda liked the thor movie nothing to do with portman who does very little for me and also my total non appreciation for the avengers goes against what d hoped that could say something great about this film and be able to champion joss whedon for new era of sci fi movies serenity was good very good albeit with forgivably tv movie quality unfortunately it seems budget wasn the limiting factor and ve now lost interest duncan jones do you hear ', ' first season pretty good second season poor too much dialogue and boring storyline think the budget was cut drastically for season two ', ' love super heroes stories but this series is totally waste of time they just keep talking talking talking and the kamala couldn accept her as super hero ', ' really don think ll remember the plot in 1 year painful memory new villain who wants to take over the world same satirical humor altho none are really that funny has some okay action but really don like all the camera shaking it sad because due to the pandemic they had plenty of time to refine the movie yet it still mediocre ', ' what did just saw what is the purpose of this movie ', ' black widow gives me old school marvel vibes with more basic storyline and downtoned action scenes that what appreciate with marvel that they really take time to do full om black widow story just for us fans also hope they stick with more down to earth movies in the future like it was so diffrent to go from watching loki to this that what like from marvel the opportunity to choose movie serie from what mode you are in and how you please fans feel like they suceeded to please me with this one as black widow movie but no suprises and the last scene was little bit dragged out also feel like it would have done better impact if this came out after civil war opening scene gave me goosepumps and is so well done love it strong 7 10 ', ' she so annoying bad actress bad running and trying to get attention ', ' really fun series that brings out the little girl in me with showing me her culture and enlightening me to new generation of child like minds know sounds creepy right actually mean what say and it is not creepy to want to be young again or superhero too think every one of you will enjoy this new series on disney this month to high acclaim try it you ll see for yourself cheers murf ', ' carol denverse teaches us by her acting that human is the most powerful being in this universe because they do fall and immediately they rise up ', ' never thought going into the cinema that the previous marvel films would amount to so much they are nothing in comparison to this masterpiece the films leading up to this being captain america thor the incredible hulk and the iron man films these films range from average to decent decent being iron man 1 which is the best out of the prequels this film works in so many ways it hard to know where to begin with the review the acting is good the story line isn complex but not too simple either each character is given good amount of screen time and no character is left under powered or look insignificant the effects are very good maybe some of the best ever so far in film making josh whedon has done himself proud loved firefly and now love this overall very very very good film it is incomparable to the dark knight or the other batman films as it is completely different type of film do love those films as well it just works ', ' the story was quite interesting in the first half buf fell overly extended in the end the villian was one of the most boring villians have ever seen and the sidekicks were pretty generic in my opinion the movie was ok but dont think that would ever feel need to rewatch this ', ' the marvels is here and it a mashed up film that is totally all over the place it feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows couple things enjoyed did like seeing carol danvers and monica rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows it allows iman vellani kamala khan to be the audience just as tom holland peter parker was in civil war did not particularly enjoy the ms marvel series but can see her being the shoutout for many think the script just touched on the surface of brie larson captain marvel herself so diving into her more is plus however the story did her no favors once again and did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one note performance in the first film teyonah parris is commendable she was the more science of the trio samuel jackson just feels inconsistent especially after secret invasion feels like this nick fury is variant he simply passing through in this film another thing liked was the incursions also briefly touched on in doctor strange in the multiverse of madness we all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into kang dynasty and secret wars finally this film it at least preps and teases what to come down the line the mcu villain problem is long known fact but here it only cements their problem even further now m fan of lee pace over the top performance as ronan but dar benn played by zawe ashton is literally copy and paste of ronan but female nothing new about it definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the mcu the power swaps were kinda cool so can give it that nia dacosta does good job executing the fight scenes but again as one should expect vfx is meh now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two doctor strange then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like misplaced musical lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an mcu film the skrulls are in the film and as fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it but just do not understand why this sequel couldn have been secret invasion one of the worst mcu disney shows secret invasion honestly should have been an avengers film or at the very least captain marvel sequel co starring some avengers kinda like civil war personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered captain marvel development due to her involvement with them and how she equally to blame for not helping them out when she and fury promised to find them home but instead she stuck with this material the mid credit scene is arguably the best part once again teasing things to come it stuff that like that that will maybe still garner interest in the mcu despite its current fall from grace the end credit scene is alright not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line on that note the recent variety article published about marvel studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble it was said that kevin feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly palm springs retreat to regroup and refocus so here hoping to next year being more consistent with quality seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality the marvels is season 1 5 for ms marvel and captain marvel sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things and let be clear at this point everything feels like homework that was going to be inevitable moving forward after infinity war and endgamge but especially when disney was announced making kevin feige spread out too thin but it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what marvel set up for us so to sum it up while did find it slightly more appealing than the first captain marvel and quantumania that isn saying much low expectations definitely helped is the marvels one of the worst no but it definitely belongs way down below the list 5 10 ', ' understand that this one is likely aimed toward teenagers but it honestly feels like show for 10 year olds in most cases would be fine but as piece of an interconnected series of movies and is confirmed to be in the next captain marvel movie aiming it toward the general audience seems like no brainer to me the character is uninteresting undefined powers and the show feels like bad modern version of freaks and geeks the script is stiff and unnatural and so is the acting ', ' mediocre film good acting excellent musical score but weak script and weak direction with fighting scenes damaged by too many editing cuts the pacing is not very good there a 15 to 20 minutes mid section when they only talk and the dialogs are rather boring also russian accents are ridiculous they should have employed russian actors instead of barbour and weisz that family would never speak english to each other while in russia they were not pretending to be an american family anymore ', ' this movie is retarded humanity must have seriously degraded if people consider this piece of crap the best of the best in cinema can believe this movie is just two points away from the same rating for scarface that movie was awesome not this piece of crap think the movie order should go like this 1 the godfather 2 scarface 3 star wars episode vi return of the jedi 4 alien 5 titanic those movies are legendary but this movie this movie is no where near legendary would rate this movie zero but since can pick that guess ll go with one star this movie has the most predictable plot ever to sum it up it goes like this bam boom bam boom cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue bam boom bam boom cheesy dialogue cheesy dialogue bam boom bam boom the end the dialogue is some of the corniest crap in film history batman and robin was corny and stupid but at least it was tolerable with arnold witty one liners the scenes that were supposed to be funny made me gag and the scenes that were supposed to be serious made me burst out laughing at how stupid they were seriously the stupidity never ends from iron man fighting thor for absolutely no reason to nick fury shooting plane carrying an atomic bomb with bazooka the plane is carrying an atomic bomb and your idea to stop it is to shoot it seriously don watch this movie it stupid and if your huge avengers fan it will be an even bigger disappointment if you want to watch good marvel movie watch spider man 2 that movie deserves an 8 3 rating not this kid friendly nonsense ', ' let me begin by declaring that hate feminism and identity politics am also very disappointed that they marvel have pushed that agenda when marketing the film the film itself on the other hand was positive surprise and no one can claim with any credibility that it is the worst film marvel has produced anyone who says that knows nothing about film and are clearly pushing an agenda themselves brie larson does good job given the role she actually plays as manipulated soldier without memories of her past am absolutely convinced that we will see her character develop in direction where she shows many more sides of herself captain marvel is clearly better than the first captain america iron man 2 and 3 thor the dark world ant man and hulk no one can claim anything else even if you hate feminism and identity politics as much as do it is on the other hand inferior to ragnarok infinity war civil war the winter soldier and the first gotg among the marvel films that have not mentioned find it difficult to place it according to feige they have also thought lot about what weaknesses she should have just so that it is possible to create some kind of tension in the films will be exciting to see what they will be ', ' mix of deadpool kill bill john wick but instead of black facial hair and tall dude its white haired short monkey and instead of having ryan reynold voice getting you on the edge of your seat its skiadis instead and he has done brilliant role here the fight scenes are really good with hint of bruce lee and the piece of art that is the drawings and the colours is like you are watching moving comic book so it has this mix of anime and marvel comics at the same pot mixed altogether for the fans of both arts ', ' the acting was poor like nickelodeon tween show bad the cinematography was confusing and disjointed was hoping good things for this show but for me it was miss for me would have scored this lower but the lead tried and the fam was on point ', ' this was terrible film the lines were cheesy the action sequences were predictable every sequence that rolled out on screen had already been done to death by countless action films before there was nothing new fresh catching or anything innovative for that matter in the way the film was shot scripted and acted just when thought things couldn get any worse the low brow tasteless racist slanderer of captain america yes know he was doing it to show this mindset was still of that of white american of the 1940 towards samuel jackson character made me want to walk out of the film and m not even black complete waste of money on my behalf to see this film receive the high acclamation that it has just goes to show how brainwashed the general population has become due to the continuous release and production of these utterly mind numbing idiotic films not even worth star ', ' this is fantastic series anchored by great 1st and 3rd season had to drop one mark due to the defenders and part of season 2 the best thing about this series are the character interactions there always someone who is mirror of the other person daredevil himself has people who want him to be better than he is or in some respects worse charlie cox is great in the role and the fight scenes are also amazing and as realistic as comic book series can be the supporting cast of foggy and karen are great as well they both help anchor daredevil in the real world and are flawed in their own unique ways other support characters are well thought out as well the only weak point is one of character arcs on season two which is the only time the show appears ott the star of the show though is wilson fisk for whatever reasons the marvel films struggle with villains not here it a credit to the show that you want daredevil to win but still love fisk the stories of themselves mostly have great arc and there are some truly classic episodes in here the only warning is if you don like violence this isn for you great comic book series but also great series in general ', ' always loved the character abd was waitting for long time for this movie but it was real dissaponitment missing lot of the black widoe history skipping the most imprtant part in her life and details of her turning to the black widow and just jumping to her last few years you really let us down by this movie nothing even near what we were expecting and waiting for so sad to ruin this character with such nad movie ', ' captain marvel is finally here in the mcu with an entertaining entry to add to the 20 movies that we ve seen over the last 10 years it not on the same level as an infinity war civil war or winter soldier quality wise but d safely say it better than about 50 of the rest of the movies it ended up pretty much smack dab in the middle of my ranking it got the usual light hearted comedy beats that most marvel movies have the action is decent though some of it is bit dark and shaky cam but overall it a pretty entertaining entry into the mcu it an origin story told in bit of different order than we are used to and think that makes it feel fresher than most of the origin marvel movies even though she the titular character felt like young er nick fury was the best part of the movie he teams up with marvel and they have bit of buddy cop vibe without him think the movie would have suffered bit but the two of them teaming up made the movie much more enjoyable it is nowhere near as bad as hulk iron man 2 3 thor 1 2 or ant man 2 each of those could tell was watching bad movie and there was little to no entertainment value here never felt bored or tired of what was seeing on screen captain marvel is solid entry into the mcu but it could have been better it not top tier nor the worst of the lot it a fun and serviceable movie who we can only hope will get better follow up films and appearances ', ' what an era marvel had until avengers endgame the infinity saga has lifted everyone hopes with marvel at very high level and the movies and web series we are getting day by day in this multiverse saga are lowering that at much worse level extremely boaring series boaring character not at all feels like we are watching some marvel series it feels like very much indian masala movies saas bahu serial womens serial etc this feels like bramhastra movie which is really worst no proper storyline no proper explanation given of lot of things on top of that the main character itself is not interesting at all her so called superpowers are also too lame really wasted my time watching this series just for the sake of understanding mcu plot for further movies had to watch this please do not watch this series directly see explanation video on youtube that will save your precious time ', ' was pretty excited for this one going in really enjoyed captain marvel and overall like most of the marvel stuff the main trio is great all together very funny and fun they all have very different personalities which gives it good dynamic it was great that is wasn 3 hours because that makes lot of marvel movies feel like bit of chore going in get the feeling that lot of the hater reviews haven even seen it it was very good loved the end credit scene thought ms marvel the series was okay but she was fantastic in the movie it felt like the exact way 16 year old would act around super hero idol and seeing crazy things in space very genuine flerkins are the best ', ' oh my god marvel movies series are like you need to stick to your screen but for this series am totally losing it feeling like am watching some old drama series ', ' black widow was much delayed by having its release slot given to captain marvel and then by the pandemic m afraid it was hardly worth the wait the story could have been good if it was properly devleoped the characters are good but the film is confusingly handled by its director many of the plot reveals are thrown away and felt in the end certain exasperation with this movie the farm scene is the most boring thing in the mcu so far it goes on forever and then we have flashbacks to if for plot reveals that just fall flat it could have been great in the end merely so so film that felt passe the moment it came out given the delays surely marvel could have done reshoots to improve the flow of the story scarlet is bad pouty actress ray winstone made for an awful villian with bad russian accent that he borrowed from cate blanchette in kingdom of the crystal skull the family theme is half decent and the reason gave it 6 rather than 4 still it was better than aquaman which watched couple of days later only just comic book movies are going downhill recently ', ' take the avengers m not even 40 minutes in and m already bored the overreliance on cgi makes everything the actors do feel forced and fake hate robert downey jr but like him am also on drugs and am spanking mine poon irlz whilst sobbing ', ' ms marvel is one of the few tv shows to come to the mcu that didn really expect to like going into it but after watching all six episodes can gladly say that marvel studios has pulled off kamala kan ms marvel introduction into the mcu when fangirl and wannabe superhero kamala kan finds bangle that is related to her family history and that has other outside sources interested in it kamala must discover her family history and secrets while also tackling the teenage life of her own while on top of it is also discovering her alter ego so first off iman vellani as the title character kamala kan ms marvel is more than perfect casting choice and is one of the best castings ever in the entire mcu the way she is able to capture the struggles of being up and coming superhero while also being teenager is entertaining while also thrilling to watch at times yasmeen fletcher as nakia bahadri is also great addition to the show matt lintz as bruno carrelli is definitely my favorite side character of the show and see why matt lintz was almost cast as peter parker spider man in the mcu before tom holland was but his role in this show fits him well other supporting characters such as kamala family and friends are also great additions in their own way while also exploring her culture and way of life if have any complaints say the way they handled the villains of the show could of been handled way differently as felt they didn fully live up to expectations also there were some scenes felt were unnecessary to the story but was able to be overlooked overall ms marvel is more than fine addition to the mcu that has one of the best casting choices in iman vellani kamala kan ms marvel that has me waiting patiently to see her once again in the mcu rating 8 10 ', ' just imagine someone has spend time and money to come up with this just imagine how out of touch with reality you have to be how isolated from the world you have to be to even think someone with healthy mind will like this and enjoy it who are these people and more importantly why do they have the power to make such nonsense try imagine it cause really can this is peak 2022 can go on forever with this but its not really worth please take step back and see what you created and why nobody likes it ', ' just finished season 1 now so it might be too early but honestly can get over how bad his acting is couldnt bare one more episod from vincent onofrio all his scenes seem too forced ', ' awful acting terrible dialogue and russian accents nonsensical script and long periods of utter boredom makes this one if the very worst films have ever seen ', ' really loved the first episode it lets you get to know about kamala and her culture family little bit it also puts you into the shoes of 16 year old and let you think about what time was like for yourself back then see lot of myself in kamala in the way she daydreams about wanting different life and being amazing but also having to deal with her future and the fear of college she a total nerd who is good person she doesn want to hurt her family but at the same time doesn feel that this life they want for her is for herself can wait to see how she comes into herself and becomes ms marvel ', ' as far as introductory marvel hero movies this is success the movie takes no time throwing you in to the story there are few familiar characters lot of mcu lore that pops up and doesnt feel forced soundtrack is great and some pretty interesting re imaginings of marvel comic stories ignore brie larson and her heavy handed discrimination ignore the politics and enjoy heavily anticipated addition to the mcu ', ' from the beginning off this movie turned one completely off the choice of bad guy was horrible pure hype machine of movie robert downey is good actor but his trite portrayal of being charming grows tiresome marvel movies have alway lacked depth and true heart however this movie engages than cruises by fast popcorn movie full of great marketing movie like this deserves one view but really easy to forget its poorly written acted due to all the hype its time for robert to hang the the suit up the first iron man was the only good one the character is now dull and annoying liam as thor has no on screen like ability or charisma chris evans plays somewhat convincing role but he couldn act his way through fast and furious mark ruffalo is the only saving grace of this movie the hulk will always be hard hero to get right he makes it work on all levels all in all this movie has become pop culture thats all dumb popcorn movie that works until it starts and ends another mediocre marvel movie pretty much this leaves nothing to the imagination ', ' the problem nowadays is that everyone seems to think that every new marvel film is going to be avengers endgame level and absolutely blow your mind this is more of short fun and chilled out marvel film that is actually in my opinion levels above the first captain marvel film ms marvel is one of the most charismatic mcu characters and captain rambeau and captain marvel herself are also lot better than usual pretty lackluster villain doesn stop this film from being lighthearted and funny but not the cringe kind of funny from an mcu film like love and thunder it also has two fantastic post credit scenes in conclusion go into this film thinking of it as more quick and fun mcu film and you ll probably like it as much as did solid mcu addition ', ' this movie just did not do it for me the movie was box office hit it made 623 279 547 in the united states alone and is third on the list of top grossing films of all time however movie earnings do not suggest it was great film obviously the concept was hit comic book superheroes converging to save earth and fight interstellar enemies just think the movie was flat though myself am not comic book enthusiast so do not personally care for superheroes and the sort but the movie itself just seemed so bland the characters actions seemed forced and there was just too much action for the movie to have any sort of depth of course there had to be action since they are superheroes but just felt like so much more could have been done with the film did not think the actors did very well either think it was just the film though most of them are great actors crossovers and ensemble character films usually do not do well and this film is prime example it was bland predictable and lacking in many fields such as character depth and plot maybe it is just my own aversion to comic book films specifically marvel ones did not even like guardians shoot me now but think many would agree with me in saying this summer blockbuster was severely underwhelming there was nothing incredible mighty or iron about it ', ' first seen this and oh this looks good and it new so m going to watch was so excited then everytime they use move of any kind it announced no matter what the move may be repulsor blast hulk smash shield throw plus introducing each character so big every time new one shows up as if you don know them would understand doing it the first episode once but after seeing about 10 minutes automatically new it was anime done by japan if disney is really going to start outsourcing marvel how long before they totally ruin it this isn even good for children growing up watching this you ll never get that feeling of knowing what marvel really is and it true depth of tremendous characters and stories this is just pure trash if you love true marvel don waist your time on this ', ' our house loves most marvel things this is one of those few that just doesn make the cut have been trying to watch it for weeks now and hve just made it through the 4th episode it just cant keep my attention fall asleep walk away or start playing on my phone because there is just no direction can connect with it ', ' was waiting for something in hawkeye style but the further look already watched 5 episodes the harder it is to me to force myself to watch new episode the show is just very badly written and it a shame because this series had everything for success professional film crew cute actress good comic base excellent cgi but failure at the script level is failure of the whole project ms marvel is an example of how you can ruin good story idea with your inability to develop characters and write dialogues all dialogues are disgustingly primitive no other marvel project has made me facepalm when hear characters talking even five year olds don talk like that the conversations are incredibly dull and boring sincerely hope that the next marvel project will have more skilled writers ', ' generally the first and best of the marvel netflix superhero shows the first season carefully sets up the formula that to come and it has little too much lightness and humour throughout but it counters that with some really strong action sequences the corridor fight in particular being highlight found that season two was even more enjoyable thanks to the inclusion of the punisher in the storyline with jon bernthal getting every one of the season best moments to him the third and final season is notable for quality writing in the character of wilson fisk and generally more mature feel it has some missteps random episode enveloping back stories for example but overall this show is one that nice to watch ', ' daredevil works because the viewers are invested in the all the main characters while charlie cox daredevil portrayal is great vincent onofrio wilson fisk elevates this series to be among the best from netflix he conducts his business on an operatic scale complete with such music when he contemplates his next moves here is master chef in his element even the supporting characters have their story arcs fleshed out while the action scenes are great and gritty watch this for the character driven masterpiece it is ', ' when did disney lose its ability to entertain adults and children in the same show this is so cheesy it makes stilton look mild it like day time nickelodean the whole script is laughable it direction amateur the acting so ridiculously over the top disney is creating more misses than hits weirdly since disney started ', ' the best version of web series of marvel with damn good actor charlie cox love you and best series please make more season with charlie cox please ', ' black widow is movie that ve wanted to see for years ever since civil war ve wanted solo movie about her and we finally got it too bad it was an epic fail black widow is one of the worst marvel movies ever made the fight scenes are absolutely terrible it insanely predictable and the villain is one of the worst they did such bad job with her it also has one of the worst lines of dialogue ve ever heard at the end and this is filler movie it just seems like placeholder for other things in the future did it also seem like fanfic written by 13 year old girl yep did only watch it for the post credits scene yep why does yelena have no accent in the beginning but she does as an adult it makes no sense black widow is really cool hero with really interesting backstory but they failed in every way florence pugh carried and she was the only good part the finale is horrible black widow is one of the worst marvel movies and m gonna give it d ', ' not much to say about this one that hasn been said millions of times before brilliant comic based movie that is for me personally the second best marvel movie ever made right behind howard the duck kidding kidding the first iron man film obviously joss whedon further proves as if any more evidence was needed that as writer director he amongst the top of his field this is also the best hulk film ever made and makes it more of shame that the ball was dropped so badly in his own films bruce banner is the stand out but all the main superheroes have their very memorable moments save for hawkever whom is woefully underused and hope his role is tad flashed out on the upcoming extended cut but really my minor gripes about the movie are few and far between loved this film ', ' have to say m really irritated by jessica jones daredevil was an outright triumph and when they announced the next series would be based on the character jessica jones was bit mystified as she not character know from the golden days of marvel unlike dd luke cage iron fist having done my bit of research put faith in netflix in going one better than dd how wrong am she doesn have any focus or lust for justice like dd she supposed to be super strong and can fly ha apparently she can fly she mostly falls wtf as for super strong let just edit that down to strong she good at breaking padlocks and that about it snoooooooze boring fail to see how or why they ve chosen to make series on character who might even be bit pretty if she wasn so goddamn miserable all the time moping around and getting drunk so flipping lame don even get me started on why the hell she hasn just offed kilgrave by now also lame she doesn seem to have problem lying to threatening and turning blind eye to all the people kilgrave has killed or attempted to kill seriously yet she so moral she feels she has to catch kilgrave and bring him to justice lame think netflix have made huge mistake investing in jj dd deserves hell of lot better if they are going to form the defenders maybe netflix thought the defenders needed team member who was morose drunk and about the most pathetic superhero you could imagine booo jessica jones and netflix give us proper superhero who can actually fly and do more than break padlocks ', ' have always preferred dc movies to marvel however avengers really changed that and provided marvel movie that could go toe to toe with the best of other comic book adaptations this is one of the best superhero movies have ever seen certainly the best marvel has put out the jokes are hilarious the action is intense every character even loki and nick fury have scenes that give us insights into their characters one of my 5 favorite movies of all time and must go for any fan of the comic book movie genre can wait for the age of ultron and the avengers 3 with thanos 10 10 ', ' after seeing the movies with dolph lundgren tom jane and ray stevenson was looking forward to seeing the new series liked jon bernthal in the few things saw with him the walking dead and wind river and really don see anything wrong with his portrayal as frank castle aka the punisher however this is not the punisher first of all it drifts off to many times that asked myself was still watching the punisher or was is the super agent madani show secondly it got overloaded with sjw crap few examples the female lead is muslim iranian special agent dinah madani from dhs investigating how the forces of evil namely the cia and the us army tortured and killed poor muslim in afghanistan there an nra fanboy who is your perfect liberal portrayal of an nra member old white fat all talk no balls constantly on about the second amendment and how our rights are slowly being taken away but in the face of confrontation he is coward yeah the plot drags on and is really predictable suspense nuh uh not here action remember some in episode 1 and 5 hey look like good thriller and conspiracy thriller but like my punisher like the two later movies stick to the action the tragic figure and keep out your sjw bs we ve got enough hollycrap movies for that ', ' that was really weak plot that would have worked as just 30minute short film stretched into movie after the trailer everyone was expecting to see an action packed movie and there was none taskmaster had to be the most disappointing entry in mcu universe so far barely had anything to do and not even had decent fight it also missed the humour that we usually have in marvel movies they tried to be funny but missed miserably 5 is the best rating this deserves ', ' it clear that this show is targeted to younger audience than the rest of the mcu but that fine it still charming creative show at episode 1 had low expectations but m looking forward to see where this goes ', ' there a strong feeling of sabrina the teenage jadu garni here an outsider home life featuring strong but kooky wamen and contrived teenage problems which can be solved with combination of learning lessons and just making up new superpowers as necessary but sabrina had writing that was sweet sly and subversive with plenty of delightful little easter eggs for parents as well as children and there precious little of that here it absolutely basic witch exposition conflict and resolution with modest effects budget that splashed on jarring adhd fireworks and hyperactive score m sure it fine for tweens and below but disney really should sort their marketing and stop pitching all their shows to all viewers there zero chance that d be interested in this it all ages appropriate but not all ages appealing ', ' m not sure what everyone else thought about this film was worried really worried it just seemed that the studio was rushing it through watched it as soon as it came out before had even read any reviews and have to say that so far it in my top 5 films of the year easily joss whedon has done fantastic job each avenger is given good amount of time on screen with iron man having the lions share the dialogue is snappy and all the actors do great job with the script mark ruffalo does superb turn as dr banner as does tom hiddlestone as loki who clearly likes being the bad guy in fact there is not one thing could say is wrong with this film there are few good laughs in this as well 2 of the best come from the hulk wont spoil it for you but one of them actually laughed out loud on and very rarely laugh out loud in the cinema overall this is fantastic film one that you could watch even if you only had small understanding of the marvel universe if like me though you are marvel fan and read the comics you will enjoy all the subtle references in the film as well as all the action go see it you wont regret it ', ' was fully expecting to not like this movie because haven thought much of iron man or captain america movies but the story behind this film was better than expected also you need to have seen previous superhero movies to get this movie especially thor loki thor evil brother comes to earth to lead an alien invasion and it up to the superheros to stop him the black widow and hawkeye have very little to do and could have been left out so basically the heroes are chasing loki around until the invasion when there is huge battle at the end the battle was cool with cool computer effects this is when the hulk gets to play his big part but the main heroes in the film were thor and ironman and captain america gets to make few decisions too final verdict ok action flick but you need to know about the previous superhero movies to get this one ', ' have to say that this is the worse thing that marvel put out for the marvel fans to watch will continue to watch only to see if there are any references to up coming marvel movies or shows ', ' ve never seen the comics its pretty good just some minor stuffs that don like pretend it did not happen don trust the ratings review bombing is getting out of hand could care less about who or what color is the skin as long as the show is good it will be recommended rate based on the show not the color of the skin ', ' loved the girl playing the kamala role movie is very nice much plot is very interesting loved every bit of it waiting for more episodes to come marvel did fantastic job shoutout to all the actors for their hard work ', ' the avengers is truly film that should be considered an instant classic joss whedon does more than do justice to getting four superheroes on the screen but he makes tremendous yarn to go with it yes the greatest strength of the film is the screenplay the one liners are keeper and it comes with some great performances as well particularly with robert downey jr and mark ruffalo the film entertains in action succeeds in comedy and manages to be one of the greatest films we re bound to see this summer and potentially one of the best films we ll see of the year and an end note if you do sequel please keep joss whedon without him expect the avengers 2 to be less entertaining overall ', ' don know what happened to marvel they are just wasted hadn many expectations from this series but still like many others couldn complete it this is just unbearable cinematography some actors were pretty good other than that everything was rubbish can summarize my review in just one sentence this series looks like mixture of youtube content indian drama soap opera ', ' the first two episodes are wanda and vision basically 7 minute trailers for upcoming wanda vision tv series anticipate the next two will probably be falcon and the winter soldier these are basically compilation of clips from the movies nothing new and not like the marvel 1 shot series inbetween the movie releases waste of time ve seen better fan made clips on youtube ', ' found that predicted every single thing that happened in the episode there is no thought process to it and for the simple minded the acting was bad and they changed phil personality too much it was absolutely unnecessary to show that woman in bra at the beginning and focusing on the on girl breast during the interrogation scene if you are going to show off women give the female viewers some eye candy too it was sexist and pointless if you think you story sucks so bad that you just have to pull crap like that then just cancel the show there are lots of females who are interested in these type of shows so why don you gear some not all things towards them btw when does pg mean you can show women in bras the rating was all wrong for this crappy show would not let my child watch this show know most pilots suck so am giving it one more chance but that is it ', ' after the mind numbing dullness of guardians of the galaxy 3 the dire antman and not so much the wasp in quantumcgioriwhatever the truly desperate hell of secret invasion and the bland morass of loki season 2 so far my expectations were low but this is great if anything it could have leaned into the more fun elements harder the three stars are three excellent actors getting to enjoy their characters the main weakness is zawe ashton feels like she acting in different film to everyone else it not done the box office business which is weird and such shame won watch any of those other recent marvel efforts again why would anyone do that to themselves but can wait to see the marvels again that the multiverse came so soon to the mcu was always very desperate sign this shows there is way of simply ignoring all that self indulgence embracing the fun and telling story ', ' let me start by saying that did in fact enjoy this movie however 8 whatever is farrrrrrrrrr from accurate you re meaning to tell me this ranks up there with films like the godfather and shawshank redemption come on now there were some really good parts there were some almost unbelievably bad parts first 10 20 min was like watching another flick entirely acting was up and down but overall it wasn bad by any means dialogue was spotty but had some good lines and few laughs loads of cgi but the action was intense af so at the end of the day it entertaining couldn watch it 5 6 times but none the less entertaining now for those who can seem to understand how ratings work was it the best movie you have ever saw no ok don rate it 10 10 was it the worst movie you have ever saw no ok don rate it 1 10 simple and for those expecting some original new fresh plot and amazingly moving dialogue seriously go somewhere else with that sh what could they have possibly done that creative with superheros especially ones that have been around for 60 years sorry ranting bit conclusion if you like superhero movies you will likely enjoy this ', ' keep thinking what this movie would turn into in the hands of zack snyder had exactly the same kind of feeling when watched the first justice league movie figured out why felt like that after watched the second one instead of following broken hero journey due to poor story telling and character development one should bear not so good jokes and ok visual effects with such resourceful story and talented cast so much can be done what waste ', ' loved the first couple of seasons started struggling in 3 and then with s4 had to almost force myself to watch till the end wasn going to watch s5 but had spare day and thought would give it go so glad did ended up binge watching the whole season the characters personalities are back humorous the writing was great and good storyline yeah m happy nerd ', ' the movie did have some redeeming qualities but brie larson was terrible she took character who in the comics isn the least bit interesting and also made her annoying between brie larsons cockiness and the characters lack of literally anything redeeming and what they did to fury didn even want to finish the movie ', ' bland movie with some funny scenes was really looking forward to seeing this and almost fell asleep ', ' could not believe the camerawork and the editing in this show they did some difficult and impressive stuff here stuff that many acclaimed directors couldn do don think most people even noticed it but cinema fans are going to get their minds blown the actors also were great since their first scenes don know how the series is going to evolve but you can consider me impressed ', ' how 7 years had been flying since the 1st avengers movie this man avengers dream coming true ', ' couldn reach another level of stupidity after thor love and thunder well with time very little work and poor writting skills they ve outdone themselves with the marvels and proved us all wrong they could do worse and they surely did the marvels is truly marvel of nonsense and stupidity if you enjoyed this movie it only shows that you were so taken by the little kittens and the bollywood charade that you failed to notice your iq dropping during this disaster of movie but hey this is what happens when you put all your money into special effects and you are left with very little to pay good writers well good night everyone m gonna watch an episode of cosmos spacetime odyssey and pray that neil degrasse tyson can help me recover the neurons lost while watching the marvels out ', ' what disappointment ive never though that could see so bad movie from marvel hope marvel stop making movies from black widow this is not hero ', ' this film is very underwhelming the jokes arent funny the characters are badly written apart from l jackson the film was rushed and uneventful it would have been more suiting as l oreal advert as captain marvels hair was wonderful at keeping its volume through all fights keep your money go to different film ', ' don usually comment on film for which m completely neutral but this film deserves neutral comment as it such waste of time and money it exhibits the typical american obsession with violence and little or no character development after fast forwarding through all the crash bang wallop scenes and still keeping track of the plot still didn care what happened to anyone including the planet scarlet johansson is completely miscast as the black widow she should be tall and willowy mark ruffalo is perfectly cast as the hulk as it suits his style of acting which is usually dumb really am fan of joss whedon and own the entire buffy collection but counted two maybe three snappy lines of dialogue in this very disappointing was going to give it 5 out of 10 but decided it deserved 6 towards the end barely just too corny for words and silly in the extreme ', ' what magical spiritual and underrated pakistani superheroes that what disney bought and tried to sell me on this one my mind was blank slate so much room for storytelling with so much potential sadly disney completely obliterated opportunity we aren left feeling more connection with pakistani culture or history we aren even left thinking ms marvel should be remembered we aren left with lesson other than not to trust another woke disaster save yourself six hours and forget this show this is not the marvel you re looking for ', ' tend to be very critical of these new disney shows but ms marvel has really surprised me it was really refreshing first episode the acting was all really good as was the set design and cinematography the pacing was perfect and the episode didn drag at all the sets felt vibrant and alive the productive value was surprisingly better than thought it would be it was also nice to have diverse cast the family dynamic was really interesting to watch the show feels really grounded and it a great departure from the other large scale interconnected cameo driven disney shows this was fantastic introduction to kamala khan and m super excited to see more ', ' must admit that hadn gone into the pilot with high expectations all the same this show was even more pathetic than predicted the character development is terrible also even with full forty minutes hardly any logical plot line is developed the acting is extremely poor and the script could have easily been written by toddler everything about this show is utterly revolting all the same there are worse things on television for instance reality tv don squander your time on this poor excuse of television show that is unless you are certifiably stupid ', ' the intro for this movie may be the best one yet in mcu history overall great acting good cgi good music but the second half was not as good as the start unfortunately ', ' the show is garbage the twist on her powers and origin is lame there is no action it too boring and childish total waste of everyones time and money disney is ruining marvel ', ' great mcu film that is able to stand alone although makes numerous links to the wider universe deserved leading role for johansson after being secondary character since the early films however the spotlight is definitely shared with the introduction of some brilliant new characters pugh and harbour play their parts to perfection adding to the action but continually providing bursts of fun and humour the exciting thing is that although this film brings close to an enduring character these instant fan favourites are given an opportunity to star in the future the choreography is excellent although for some of the more outlandish action sequences the cgi seems bit wayward or the screen blurs the plot advances swiftly allowing no time for boredom and who have thought that ray winston could be russian villain things lose their way little towards the end and the taskmaster isn the most inspired villain in the world it hard to tell whether the accents are any good being an outsider but you can definitely notice at which odd points the dialogue switches from english to russian there little consistency there odd bits thrown in such as whistling at the end which is either callback to something that didn happen or to something that wasn memorable for all its faults black widow does justice for character that has served for so long it fun it exciting and it a good send off ', ' awesome story plot awesome cast awesome culture must watch how they created beautiful scenes with different culture people thumbs up looking fwd to see farhan akhtar when any avengers show up eager to wait it every episodes excite me ', ' good actors and great cinematography but silly plot and villain ve always loved black widow in the avengers movies but she deserved better story in her own movie this one was bit messy and boring great cgi and effects though but ve seen this kind of action so many times before very good but sad after credit scene ', ' worst marvel movie ever poor story line wasted 3 hours of my life ', ' look didn like the first act lot the amnesia angle rarely makes for great entertainment in my eyes and this movie is no exception don think every joke landed although after reading some quotes have the impression that some stuff was lost in translation watched it in german not every action scene was as good as most others in marvel movies so why still eight points eight points for me is rating for movie that is either plain good without being extraordinary or good movie which lesser things are compensated by the good the latter is th case for me here liked brie after the first few scenes her acting is good and the flat acting some complain about is actually motivated by the story and shows her growth or rather rediscovering who she is like the message and the way she overcomes the obstacles for all those complaining how she is too powerful and was never in danger did you actually watch the movie yes the end she is pretty overpowered which is one reason this character could not join the mcu earlier but until that point in the story she gets her ass kicked few times and is never shown as actually much more powerful than any other character only after she uses her full potential could agree but that is the climax so not really different from many movies especially in this genre and fitting for this character all in all this is not great movie for me but good one an entertaining one ', ' maintaining the same heavy and dark atmosphere daredevil introduces us to more complex iconic characters of the marvel universe elektra and the punisher without forgetting the existing ones we see lot of character development on karen page as she investigates the punisher and constantly questions her own values and beliefs as well as foggy we know his insecurities and beliefs better as his friendship with matt murdock is once again threatened have to point out that did not like the evolution of karen and matt relationship although understand why they decided to include it in the show because of the comics was not much of fan although we got glimpse of the constant internal debate of matt murdock in season one this time matt seems to be constantly struggling about what wrong and right what a hero and villain with the introduction to the punisher and elektra this debate was inevitable and this is one of the most exciting things of this season was always trying to categorize the three of them into hero or villain and came to the conclusion that not that black and white humans are so complex and for that reason there is thin line between good and bad person we are not just good or bad we have both traits in ourselves jon bernthal plays frank castle aka the punisher who is vigilante who not afraid to use violence murder kidnapping torture etc in his war on crime frank castle is fascinating character an antihero that can make us love and hate him at the same time he brings lot of violence to the season which we all love jon bernthal gives an epic performance and hope we can see him more often in this amazing universe that netflix created what mean is give him his own tv show elektra played by elodie yung is trained violent assassin but she also an ex girlfriend of daredevil loved the tension between both of them and also all the story of their past and why she appeared in new york looking for his help when they are together we see matt murdock actually enjoying his powers which was really fun elodie yung was pleasant surprise after watching this season can imagine elektra being played by anyone else she gives an amazing performance and also wish to see more of her in the future elektra is fascinating character and there still lot that has not been told in other words give her her own tv show some people criticize this second season by not having consistent villain don agree with that first of all enjoyed the different approach of introducing two new antiheroes instead it shows that the creators are not afraid of trying something new the fact that they don want to repeat themselves and have always the same structure shows that this tv show should be praised also the complexity of elektra and the punisher completely occupied the show leaving no space for villain quite enjoyed wilson fisk appearances and can wait to see what happens to him next season daredevil managed to surprise me with once again impeccable action scenes all over the season marvel daredevil did not disappoint couldn help watching the whole season in three days and honestly can wait to watch again the intense atmosphere spectacular script breathtaking action scenes and stunning performances made me completely surrender can wait for the third season and also for the rest of the tv shows related to the marvel universe on netflix marvel luke cage is next and if it is as good as daredevil and jessica jones netflix will make history ', ' this movie is getting immensely good reviews universal critical acclaim d hate to be the sore thumb standing out giving the movie an average review or what sounds below average compared to all the other reviews but was having hard time enjoying this movie part of the problem was an overwhelmingly distracting midnight premiere audience liked it better the second time few weeks later when the theater was much less attended but not whole lot because of reasons ll explain next though this is combination superhero movie the idea of which really like and though it likable how the interactions between the heroes was important wasn so completely sure the relationships between the heroes was very believable sometimes it seemed so but not really expected there to be more time devoted to the heroes getting to know each other as if they were actually unaware of each other before the start of the movie but instead they all knew each other pretty well pretty early it seemed the heroes showed little less respect to each other than they probably should have in fact in several parts heroes got into fights with each other which really don like seeing in the movies would have liked to see captain america my personal favorite of the avengers heroes in more of leadership role than what he was given but would the captain shield forged by mortal muggles back in the 1940 really be able to deflect iron man or loki power beams which is maybe just minor complaint speaking of loki he and his brother are back from thor and loki seemed to stand out little more as good villain than he did in thor but then there is the awkward situation that those characters as gods or demigods or whatever you call them contribute to the story this combination superhero movie makes the point that team of superheroes can do more than what one superhero could do by himself but because loki god was the main bad guy spent most of the movie believing that thor also god would have been the only hero capable of stopping loki would also have liked to see more of the supporting characters from the pre avengers movies show up in this movie erik selvig from thor and pepper potts from iron man were good showing up and it had to have been hard bringing back most or all of the captain america characters what with them being from the 1940 but wish we could have seen don cheadle or terrence howard as rhodey from the iron man movies william hurt as general ross from the incredible hulk anthony hopkins as odin from thor or the heroes girlfriends liv tyler as betty ross from the incredible hulk natalie portman as jane foster from thor or hayley atwell as peggy carter from captain america pictures of jane and peggy both appeared briefly so that was okay the existing supporting characters were good for the most part particularly nick fury and phil coulson though don know how nick fury apparent lack of superpowers puts him in rightful place to lead h e d or team of superheroes but also have to say it was awkward that natasha romanoff black widow and clint barton hawkeye were on the avengers team though romanoff is pretty good at spying and kicking butt she not superhero m sure that some showbiz news story reported back in 2009 or so that black widow would be villain alongside whiplash in iron man 2 but it was disappointment to me watching iron man 2 that she never turned out to be villain she still not villain in the avengers her name natalie rushman as used in iron man 2 seems to be completely fake and her name black widow was used couple times in the avengers which was infinitely more than the number of times it was used in iron man 2 and why is she called black widow she not african american she doesn have dead husband that know of and she was never bitten by radioactive spider hawkeye doesn have any interesting or significant name either and his superpower is nothing more than notable skill in using bow and arrow and though he appeared briefly in thor which didn notice the first time watched it couldn tell how his involvement made the movie much more interesting so describe this movie as being about four superheroes not five or six or seven one supervillain supervillain army of evil baddies and four muggle supporting heroes maybe m just not familiar with the comic books these characters are based on and maybe m just overthinking this little too much on the other hand the action was marvelous and if was to judge this movie entirely by its action it would be the best or almost best action movie ever made while still sitting in the theater my first time was little bothered by how pessimistic about this seemed to be but walking out of the theater felt little more optimistic that m sure ll like this more when see it more times ', ' an entertaining movie remarkable how much the bad guy reminds me of harvey weinstein maybe that just me ', ' ms marvel is great as someone who isn familiar with the ms marvel comics they are doing great job with the backstory also cultural accuracies can speak to but think they did nice job making it more up to date and just gives you perspective of where she comes from people need to relax and let things play out every marvel series started slow ', ' looks like the losiest of marvel shows and that includes wandavision which was miserable mess honestly there just is nothing worth capturing the imagination or interest in this so far ', ' never thought mcu could stoop so low never ever though that would give mcu movie 1 star but this movie deserves that looks like the writers were sleeping always knew dc comics were better that marvel comics but earlier movies were written so spectacularly written they overshadowed the story but movies of late are definately written in bitter state wonder what else is in store miss the good old days of mcu but not this kind of garbage this movie has to be the in one of the worst written movie only advantage is that the length of the movie is short so can skip everything in 15 minutes this movies does not add anything just made by 10 year old think ', ' loved this movie scarletts and florences preformances were amazing loved every second of the movie and m seeing it in the cinema fir the second time tomorrow and watched it 6 times since it came out on disney ', ' this friends is the comic book movie that all other comic book movies wish they could be it the pinnacle the ultimate the surely unsurpassable achievement in its particular oeuvre grand adventure full of humor action tension fan service and an undeniable pathos for anyone fearing that all the hype years and years worth of hype might cheapen or otherwise overshadow the final outcome you may at last be at ease because the joss whedon avengers movie is exactly as good as we all hoped it could be maybe even better the avengers of course are superhero team made up of iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth hawkeye jeremy renner and the black widow scarlett johansson other heroes have come and gone amongst this happy few in comic form but here all you need to know is that this film serves as kind of sequel to previous marvel movies iron man both 1 and 2 the incredible hulk thor and captain america bringing the billionaire tony stark the scientist bruce banner the demigod thor and the recently defrosted world war ii veteran steve rogers together to fight against an invading alien threat alongside spies clint barton jeremy denner and natasha romanov scarlett johansson and under the auspices of nick fury samuel jackson agent of h e d man it awesome awe some oh it by no means perfect film whedon is perhaps just shade too in love with h e d technology and the weight of portent which is given to some truly innocuous lines especially the final line feels little off kilter flashing up computer image of natalie portman jane thor love interest from his movie felt little like an apology and the shadowy government hacks who attempt to control nick fury are by the numbers backroom power players of the cigarette smoking man school ruthless and annoyingly clich everything else though simply outstandingly without shadow of doubt incredible just for fun let talk acting all our returning superheroes reprise their roles with ease downey jr once again delight as the arrogant billionaire stark and evans stoic and earnest as the displaced cap the award for most improved has to go to chris hemsworth whose thor is given chance to rock some deadpan wit here and rock it he surprisingly does johansson of course is gorgeous and ass kicking as ever in her black widow leather but is happily also given new levels of intriguing backstory at which to hint and play out and her friend hawkeye is given somewhat more to do here than he was allowed in thor jeremy renner relaxed performance once again worthy of my beloved marksman bow and arrow clark gregg mild mannered agent coulson is adorable in his hero worship meanwhile our main antagonist in this film is loki thor resentful trickster brother once again played with consummate creepy cool by tom hiddleston oh and hello again gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts aren you funny and great of the newcomers will admit to having had some reservations about mark ruffalo bruce banner as had been true devotee of edward norton turn in the role but am big enough to admit when am wrong he was terrific here as the mousey mild mannered science guy with chip on his shoulder and the uses to which his hulk was put throughout the course of this movie have almost entirely changed my mind about his place in the marvel universe it was that good elsewhere how met your mother cobie smulders as an agent of h e d did lot with little enough to hope we see more of her lithe and loyal lieutenant character in avengers 2 indeed after rollicking outrageous hilarious outing like this one who wouldn already be eagerly awaiting sequel it is unequivocally the best comic book movie have ever seen and ve seen well all of them more than that it is my favorite movie so far this year whew was so hoping battleship wouldn continue to hold that title for too much longer and one cannot wait to see again avengers assemble they say audience assemble say and assemble and assemble and assemble again and make sure you stay through the credits for the now expected next movie teaser buffy and angel fans will be particularly happy even if they don quite get the somewhat obscure comic reference this review first appeared in geek speak magazine www geekspeakmagazine com ', ' demand the film be remade asap this retconned and that tony masters be given his due apart from that good action movie with decent story ', ' the movie is as good as you would expect from marvel product just nevermind the jealous dc fans ', ' season 1 9 10 season 2 7 10 season 3 10 10 this show is awesome it intense violent the action is awesome and it well written watched this because disney announced new daredevil series so figured should see this first and it totally worth watch seeing it for myself also lead me to believe that disney will without doubt mess their show up can do it very much justice just by explaining it so go watch it yourself also keep in mind that you need to watch defenders between seasons 2 and 3 it okay like 7 10 but it only 8 episodes long so it not too painful to get through ', ' just boring movie silly story that you can tell in five minutes so they filled it with lot chasing and fighting boring boring boring ', ' agree with most people that marvel is becoming uninteresting this movie is the same uninteresting enjoyed captain marvel so was let down with this one the story was played out with generic villain and predictable action sequences however found one thing surprising iman vellani did fantastic job in this film she was breath of fresh air honestly wouldn say liked the ms marvel series so had no hopes for that character that character was refreshing because of how bland most of this movie felt but regardless of why it did the trick for me she was good and the film was okay ', ' could have been much much better disappointed awful casting poor acting and the humour just doesn land found it hard to warm to any of the characters give it 5 as did at least manage to watch til the end just ', ' brie larson gave an average performance and her supporting cast constantly stole scenes the movie lost steam toward the end and almost fell asleep this happened in scene where brie was supposed to give dramatic performance but it fell far short as did my interest at that point overall this is good movie if you are mcu or action fan ', ' first off once again imdb making me review show as whole vs it independent season is downright criminal season 1 is fine season 3 is sooooo stupid boring as hell at parts just ignores basic humanity at others m mad watched it all the guy is serial killer and he human kill the guy already omg ', ' everyone has their own set of morale that they think is good or evil or right or wrong or just brilliant composition of people struggling with their decisions like the rest of us there are just no words to express discontinuation of this show this show along with most of it orginal characters has to come back ', ' boring movie the villain taskmaster didn had any impact on the story the story was very simple and predictive all the time nothing is great about this movie ', ' to much clich to much feminist hope marvel studios stops to make any movie like this anymore ', ' to me this show feels like throw back to an earlier time in comics related media unfortunately not in good way the show feels dark and edgy in an effort to seem grown up in way comics did in the eighties and nineties it the way teenagers sometimes hate the things they liked as children in an effort to appear grown up find it little disappointing that this show has been reviewed so well at time when superhero tv shows had appeared to have moved on from that and have grown up and embraced their roots m not prude don mind nudity or violence if it serves the story and it the story that the problem it just too bleak for me m sick of heroes who are cursed by their power and certainly don need villain as vile as kilgrave there enough of that in the real world shows like the flash have shown that it possible to do great characters with great stories even while utilising some of the stranger elements of their source material there are even great shows with female leads in agent carter and supergirl all those shows have an energy to them that jessica jones lacks because no one in it has any joy love the mcu and wanted to see the netflix shows come together and see how they fit into that universe so it really sad that just don want to watch this to the end of it first season think it the first superhero show ve ever quit but m not going to endure this when there are so many good superhero shows on television right now ', ' season 1 the storyline of this show was great the main character and story was dark really liked how they build up the whole story for the punisher there were some good action scenes but jon really nailed his role this guy really made this show more fun while being the punisher ending was great too 9 10 season 2 this season came with some new surprises and some interesting twists there were some good action scenes and then there was great ending but it feels so bad that show like this got cancelled it deserves chance to get renewed jon really need to get back as punisher coz this is absolutely fire 9 10 ', ' for one enjoyed this yes it pretty disney fied but it made to appeal to specific demographic that demo being kids teens and true blue comic fans thought it was all done really well learned bout about different culture and see the necessity of this being in the world as white guy cannot speak for how pakistani or muslim people feel about this character series but feel that it filled void and offered positive representation for the people especially kids of that and similar cultures it was especially heartwarming to see how happy and perfectly cast iman vellani is to be in this role when reading the reviews imagined salty white men writing all the negative ones try it it effortless good job marvel and disney for bringing this into the mcu ', ' the movie was way too long we fast forward through the beginning of her childhood the acting was boring and soulless was this comedy or what ', ' better and better a big fan now man ce sa zic de serial ', ' this movie had nothing to offer other than just expanding the marvel universe so if you re not really keen on keeping up with every marvel detail this movie is quite hollow apart from being marvel movie this is just another plain formulaic action movie 4 10 its yikes for me ', ' know this is always down to personal opinion but my order so far is as follows wandavision 9 10 loki 9 10 what if 8 10 hawkeye 7 10 falcon and winter soldier 7 10 moon knight 6 10 ms marvel 4 10 hope it starts to improve ', ' dont waste your time looks like it was made for 5yo kids on nickelodeon complitely uninteresting not engaging confusing and unnecessary twists unreasonable characters grown ass men and women taking the most childish of decisions also brie looks miserable is she okay this movie shoud not ever be associated with marvel and cpt marvel should not be considered an avenger after this movie the writing is just horrible all over the place looks like the movie was 30 cut am trully sorry that wasted so much time of my life to watch this disaster it is very difficult for me to understand how something like this passed and reached the box office ', ' the movie was great great bg action packed scenes the cinematography nd direction was the best plot could have been better the villain is not given enough exposure not so much is shown about natasha past unlike where expected hell lot of about it how did she join shield how did she escape the red room what about the dance sequels shown in age of ultrons not so much is shown about budapest nd natasha operation with clint in budapest while don expect endgame level movie but natasha deserved better farewell ', ' first season is fun ride second season is garbage season two is stretched thin and long its almost pain to watch its outrageously stupid watch the first season and give the second miss else 13 hours of your life you ll never get back ', ' first started to watch when the show just aired in 2013 and gave up after 5 episodes gosh did feel like marvel had let us down with cheap and stupid product then last week january 2016 ended up on agents of shield imdb page and saw whole lot of reviews saying that the show got really good around the middle of season 1 well ll be one of those many now ok it starts out really annoying and you may even wonder if the target audience isn teenage slugs no offense to slugs but it totally worth suffering through don wanna spoil it for you so here ends my review ', ' with simple plot each character gets to shine brilliantly and despite all the previews there still plenty of wit and action to keep you grinning from beginning to end it an incredible feat that joss and all the team have pulled this movie off there one very minor little criticism where two scenes noticeably seemed to cut off the characters heads that said ve just seen this film in 2d and will be going again to see it in 3d brilliant s m totally in love with the hulk swoon hopefully this heralds new hulk movie headed by ruffalo and an action intensity following on from the avengers that was lacking from the first two attempts ', ' this show is just lame lame typical story of an anonymous hero who is being dealing with the past as well as working through their issues plus they have been seen by somebody uhhhhh big twist marvel has become so popular that tv makes are taking small time heroes that are cheap to lease form them and trying to make them into cool tv show well it is too much for me it is the same story over and over again but this time there is chick who name is jessica jones really failed attempt on making second daredevil show and almost as lame and cheesy as arrow but not quite all the people saying this is amazing and awesome had been possessed by the idea wow every original series netflix makes is great no this is lame and waste of my time ', ' david harbour was the only thing enjoyed in this movie don relay follow the mcu so had no idea what was going on and what how black widow is and what why she is doing any of this the action was very cringey and the constant camera switching made it look so broken up and every where not good movie just watch some martial art movie instead ', ' it was okish but very nickelodeon style show meant for the wizards of waverly place crowd and if that was their plan then hey they achieved it don know what they were going for so can be too hard on it it will probably appeal to the pre teen crowd older teens might think it is bit cringey ', ' this show is my least favorite mcu series by far the story is slow af and woke and the comedy is beyond cheesy few times do actually find myself interested really hope they can turn this around with the remaining 4 eps ', ' nope not my cup of tea this is just bad this hero is not well known so introducing her in different series instead of having her own standalone show would have been better the characters are meh not much depth to them also does it even has villain mean good villain can make or break series overall im very disappointed with this series ', ' season 1 was entertaining enough that looked forward to season 2 but boy was that fustercluck found myself looking at my phone for pinterest ideas on postage stamp art in the middle of fight scenes ', ' she also love going fights and battles she knows how to control her emotions better than anybody and they didn really do that in this film which was kind of aggravating little bit and understand you know oh it the path she taking whatever but still at the same time when she in the middle of fight or war she knows how to shut her emotions off until the time being is over and mean they were making her care too much that not who black widow is and that not how she spends her the whole every mcu movie yes she at the after the battle is over and everything but not in the middle of it she doesn try and grab an enemy hand help them so they don fall thatthat was very aggravating the other thing is yes training is great and yes understand they did all of these girls were assassins and they all were trained you know but there a whole other thing when it comes to life experience fighting for your life and fighting and natasha don have more than all of them put together so for them to even come close in fight was kind of upsetting as well and that even including the villain taskmaster because if you think about it he really not in that much so and know what his power is but they also did his power wrong he doesn like carbon copies someone he figures out their moves and then figures out with their next moves going to be ', ' this is best representation of muslim super hero big love from pakistan so proud to see total pakistani vibes in this tv sgow true pakistan represntation love every bit of it ', ' what great show it feels so organic genuine heartfelt and the beautiful colors design music and story had me on the edge of my seat and wanting more really don know why it has so many poor reviews it better than some of the shows that have been done like falcon and the winter soldier and hawkeye really pale in comparison please watch this one kamala actress is amazing ', ' love it its breath of fresh air for the marvel universe and american cinema the more the minority presence the better also of course they had to have white savior character for her which is her best friend ', ' this movie was great don let any of these sour little boys try to convince you otherwise much more entertaining and enjoyable than any captain america movie ve seen all of these negative reviews are written by men who are used to every female character being written through the male gaze great movie worth watching ', ' overall this film delivers and this compliment comes from marvel fan though each individual hero remains true to character from their singular franchise the film is nearly live action cartoon there is humanism that live action brings to screen that animation lacks it called emotion and marvel avengers noticeably void of it regardless of that critique no one goes for these types of films for ultra realism but more so for the production value great action choreography johanssen is terribly hot in black leather plenty of explosions and the hulk does what he does best smash the idea of some of my favorite hero banding together overcoming inter personal differences during time of dire need and ultimately saving the day left me satisfied this one is must see and recommend paying the extra to watch it in 3d btw don forget to hang around until the full extent of the credits have passed there are two additional scenes one of which gives clues to sequel and if you re marvel fan you ll be giddy as school girl with bag of lolly pops when you see it ', ' the whole script is total garbage the dialogues the jokes the characters simply everything said and most of the things done are cheesy silly and way off the movie made me sick black widow deserves better move way better movie mean what kind of person wrote this script and thought yeah this is great script and then what kind of person approved it thinking it will make great movie ', ' one of the best marvel films so far like that her costume is so close to the comic its so funny and full of heart ', ' in the last two centuries of the screen or maybe one we get one thing big that represents pakistani character but everything about it is indian what the hell is chak day phattay no one says that in pakistan whatever the culture or the behavior is presented in the series has nothing to do with anything pakistani did they even bother to have look at how pakistani people talk what are their lingual features ', ' have this weird thing where go for the reviews first and then watch something always do this so did for agents of h e d the reviews were not very bad but some were where people compared this to the movie the avengers mean come on if people were expecting something at that level it was their mistake so it a pretty straight forward show with some great graphics action and terrific cast know it a little to early to say but think the cast was fine it had humor action thrill suspense and everything you expect in something by joss so before you see it don read the reviews because it depends on what kind of person are you some may like it some may disliked everyone thinks different ', ' found this entertaining m not sure why people are being so critical the action and fight choreography are the best ve seen in marvel film the performances worked for me give it chance and see what you think ', ' the avengers is almost the definition of good time at the movies not burdened with the need to spend great amounts of time on character origins this superhero film takes conveniently short amount of time to put the game in play and once it does that the game is played with flair and showmanship quite frankly the plot itself is absurd but guess that was bound to happen when you combine the worlds of five different marvel heroes in less capable hands the avengers may well have ended up getting muddled from trying to do too much with joss whedon in the director chair it actually very strait forward two hours with good level of focus while new york ends up getting the same treatment as much of michael bay resume the experience is far less superficial the avengers does not insult our intelligence quite the opposite in fact it embraces it the avengers best quality is that it never ceases to wink at itself this is movie where even the villains the same quick fire one liners as the heroes good protagonist of course is also the difference between good action movie and good movie simply put these people or rather super people are just good fun to be around while none of them are ever quite fully rounded when they come together as team they seem far less superficial than they did in their individual movies with the exception of iron man the films of thor captain america and the incredible hulk were not all that memorable when it came to characters the avengers makes you realize how distinctive each character is one thing was little disappointed in was samuel jackson while he is very much at home in the role he plays it seems pretty obvious that he just playing himself perhaps there is hidden positive in this as supporting character you don wanna upstage the people who have top billings personally think he could ve given the avengers little bit more love last summer was somewhat underwhelming year for superheros it a pleasure then to see film like the avengers fly in to save the day it a film made with love and the work has paid off ', ' visuals check it ok story first episode so the story must unfold nothing to say about it yet point of view from child perspective of being superhero for who kids about negative reviews see the message behind the script most people just want guns and yeah ', ' so initially coming out of the theaters after watching the marvels thought it was better than ok first thing thought the movie itself was fun there were moments was laughing smiling and overall just enjoying myself they definitly didn skip out on the overall set designs and wardrobe designs for the movie it was colorful cinematography was gorgeous the fight choreography was clever and fun the sound design and overall soundtrack was pretty good thought brie larson character needed some much needed character growth and comparatively to the previous movie we got more as far as character moments for her she expressed more than previous which was good but sadly for me still think she plays the character little bit to stale at times thankfully she wasn leading this movie alone teyonah parris did great job alongside brie and definitly had some really good character moments iman vellani hands down was the standout you can tell she was having ball with this character all three characters felt played off of each other pretty well in my opinion can say the same for zawe ashton villain though zawe ashton sadly falls right in the lines of mcu villain obscurity she acts like more of an obstacle than an actual character unfortunately overall would say that initially think movie has much clearer vision than previous and more memorable moments but doesn really offer anything we haven seen before that still doesn change all the positive i ve already said s stay for the credits ', ' avengers assemble is big budget summer blockbuster that action packed perfectly cast it so awesome to see these heroes we all grew up loving on screen together in big adventure fantasy thriller avengers has the right amount of seriousness light humour the action scenes are awesome it amazing seeing captain america hulk thor iron man together fighting side by side we also have the awesome hawkeye black widow joining the fight the cast is excellent we have the legendary samuel jackson as nick fury the guy who assembles the avengers when threat against earth rises chris evans is perfect as steve rogers aka captain america he my favourite of the avengers team one of my favourite marvel characters ever along with the punisher daredevil evans has the perfect balance of lost weary old school soldier also in control tough confident leader when needed he a fantastic complex character the whole cast is perfect though thor is fun tough loyal that down to great performance from chris hemsworth robert downey jr is perfect as rich guy super hero iron man he playful funny super smart it a fantastic performance mark ruffalo is excellent as the big mighty incredible hulk another perfect performance bringing nice guy scientist bruce banner to life the big green beast within the absolutely beautiful scarlett johansson is outstanding as extremely tough super smart black widow she extremely dangerous extremely brave also we have the excellent marksman hawkeye played perfectly by jeremy renner who is probably my 2nd fave character after captain america hawkeye is cool tough loyal warrior this first avengers film is truly outstanding big piece of pure fantasy entertainment near perfect super hero film director joss whedon is genius he writes this brilliant stuff directs it ', ' love the punisher the best there is luke cage iron fist jessica and afcorse daredevil you are awesome and flawlessssss thanks for everything love to see your series it is apic coolest stuff have ever seen punisher you are greath respect ', ' this is thoroughly enjoyable serial the special effects in this film are extraordinary especially the flying sequences and especially considering that this was done in 1941 as comaprison watch the two superman serials shot serveral years later with the late kirk allen where suddenly allen turns into cartoon when he takes off tom tyler was perfect as the world mightiest mortal aka the big red cheese as marvel was known in the comics properly stoic this is definitely the best of the super hero serials this should be enjoyed by young and old alike definite 5 star serial highly recommended ', ' black widow can make up its mind about what kind of film it trying to be it shifts quite abruptly from family friendly jason bourne knock off to parodic spy family comedy to nonsensical cartoon plot the beginning promises generic and intense action movie which fails as soon as the protagonists display completely invincible durability negating any tension the second act is by far the best part of the film and brings together the family members back together great scenes like the prison escape sequence yelena distraught longings for family and the ramblings of red guardian really deepen the emotional core and relationships of the characters the third act is mind numbingly absurd as it escapes its grounded spy movie feel and transcends into traditional marvel territory any pretense of hard hitting action and emotion give way to overly obvious green screening unnecessary monologues inexplicable sky fortresses freefall fights and legions of girl drones controlling current events around the world ll take the sisterly banter and skip the mind controlled pigs please ', ' big fan of the marvel series and how they were able to have success in challenging time for cinema however lately it seems that they are cutting corners similar to netflix it looks like their goal was to mass produce low quality and cost shows and hope that they stick off brand name alone and similar to netflix you can see that it just doesn work the script was boring the characters were bland and stereotypical it one thing when you make spin off shows off existing characters who are already known and loved falcon and winter soldier loki hawkeye this was shot in the dark and predicitably and unfortunately wide miss ', ' ok just imagine this you are watching movie everything is good everything is going great you are middle of movie and suddenly cuts to the final act this was what felt movie was going good and just cuts to the final act just see why they did it we needed more time with red guardian with his family they are having family moments and they cut to the third act ', ' the avengers features an ensemble cast of some of the biggest and best names in hollywood including robert downey jr as iron man chris evans as captain america mark ruffalo as the hulk chris hemsworth as thor scarlett johansson as black widow and jeremy renner as hawkeye just to name few the film writing is excellent it has very well structured and engaging storyline that effectively balances the different characters and subplots in way many crossover superhero films lack the film humor is also noteworthy point for me with joss whedon signature wit on full display throughout the action scenes are also visually stunning and exciting with the special effects and cgi in particular being dazzling the acting is also fantastic with each actor bringing their game to their respective roles the chemistry between the cast is magnificent with the various characters bouncing off of each other in way that is both entertaining and believable overall in my opinion the avengers is an excellent superhero film that is sure to enthral with its strong writing excellent performances and exciting action scenes ve rated it 9 10 primarily for its effective storytelling top notch action sequences and standout performances from its talented cast ', ' sorry but her sarcasm and attitude makes this show so enjoyable ', ' this movie is the absolute reason go to the theaters in hopes that film will be made this well and be entertaining to boot had figured this would be good movie but when saw it was blown away the characters were spot on each having the right roles in the movie another thing is this movie made me laugh it was witty at just the right moments ever character defending earth in their own way the story was good plot was good as well can only give this movie 10 would give it an eleven but you know have to stay withing the rules is this the best movie every made well everyone is different so probably not to everyone but if you do watch this movie and don like it you really should check your pulse to see if your even alive cause it just plain awesome ', ' marvel has pretty much fallen after endgame their shinning bright light was no way home but post that every series movie has been disaster somehow loki season 2 was different and good but again this movie was worse from every angle such weak cast poor storytelling didn feel any kind of connection with the movie it was more like watch and forget then and there not at all recommended don understand what the marvel house is thinking of their future because it not looking good with these kind of disasters one after another watched this movie just because of being loyal fan to marvel for the last one decade but now feel it time that stop watching these in theatres it not worth ', ' in the grand scheme of the mcu this movie feels really pointless couldn tell you what this movie was about or what happened in it it was that forgettable please don pay 30 to watch this movie it is absolutely not worth it ', ' think this movie was made for 16 year olds who ve never heard of the word hegemony who just want hulk to rescue iron man without understanding what motivates his change of heart towards tony stark or who see nothing wrong with shots concentrating on scarlett johansson butt and don understand the inner conflict of the characters the film tries to use humour and action sequences to gloss over poor story development poor character choices and action sequences that really don propel the story or characters forward but that seem to happen for their own sake on the plus side there are some very clever witty lines especially from tony stark but they re wasted opportunity to explore thor and loki relationship more which was set up so well in the thor movie unfortunately the movie is full of so many clich that you see them coming mile away there also lot of cringeworthy dialogue trying to sound profound if that not bad enough the film has no heart something that the 1st iron man and thor movie had in spades there was clear arch with the characters we knew what their pain is and what they needed to get by the end of the film the avengers in this movie are paper cut outs with no depth they re almost parodies of themselves and this is very obvious with hulk vs bruce banner which is pity because the animated series on sabc 3 currently shows how interesting the character dynamics can be without sacrificing what makes each character tick here didn feel anything for the characters didn care whether they live or die or get anything new that we haven seen in their past incarnation instead was bombarded by dumb 1980 drivel about how we need big brother america and right is might mentality ja nee actually the film is more about how america sees itself and what it thinks not so subtle indoctrination into why we need team america world police this time in form of the avengers it a pity that movie with no proper character development story with no build it actually throwback to time were escapist films were far removed to anything resembling peoples lives values or smart comment on our times will make millions until people realize that the emperor is naked like they did with spiderman 3 well if you want movie where you will check out your brain at the door and watch things explode then this movie is for you if you want to laugh in short bursts in between then this movie is for you but if you want an action movie that will move you suggest your rent iron man 1 and thor instead ', ' yooooo this movie slapped it had everything it got dark but kept its humor well dude pray marvel movies all start being this quality usually think they are just fun but actually cared about the characters and the story like dang the action was so entertaining and felt rawer and ms romanoff got to be more of person obviously it wasnt all perfect but am just glad that it was better then expected and far more substantial then the 3 ironman movies sat thru cant believe had to wait this long smh no shade to mr stark but god d give up all his movies all of captain americas and most of thors for another one of these ', ' the start was good with great beginning but after that the movie story and action are not strong enough the villain will have no strong appearance was not convinced by the reason they are fighting for the good thing was when the comedy starts to show up ', ' you can ignore all the extremist grades because they re obviously biased in my humble opinion as 41 yo m just watching it because it marvel and will have connection with the 23 capitain marvel movie as show for itself it is indeed aimed for children not for the whole family but specifically for children maybe if was teenager d like little bit more maybe if wasn such huge marvel fan d probably like it little bit less btw there are currently only 2 episodes aired so there a good chance things will gear up from now on fingers crossed update yeah they didn ', ' after the events of captain america 1 peggy carter works code breaking and data analysis but due to her boss is not allowed to go on field missions hayley atwell in the role proved so popular that they had to come up with ways of bringing her back this is the first and least awkward the action is great combining tension and humor cinematography and editing are excellent this runs 12 minutes or 15 and half with end credits this is currently available on disney plus recommend it to fans of the franchise 8 10 ', ' said d be back here when watched it tried to stay off my ipad but yeah well could ve been worse suppose did not learn anything from this movie like had hoped and ended up writing the next chapter based on godzilla instead heh however 3 movies to go maybe the next 3 will give me some ideas for my story enjoyed it though it had it moments but overall it was not bad d start the second one unfortunately also have to watch fusion war and honestly zamasu obsession here so that first to watch than can continue the rest of the movies and hopefully gain something new or if not at least finally ll have watched all the movies ', ' one of the worst films that have ever seen the story line was drab the acting was terrible and plot holes everywhere people actually walked out the cinema even fell asleep for 20 mins cannot recommend this film at all if the film was food in restaurant would have asked for my money back total rubbish ', ' this is the first review have written on this website but having seen some of the negative reviews for what feel is brilliant film felt the need to weigh in the avengers does everything that it sets out to do perfectly it pulls of huge action scenes with 6 major characters without making them compete for screen time it has funny and clever dialogue and it manages to actually give the film strong sense of continuity with the previous titles in the series in way which works very well saw this film with my 13 year old brother and for once we both agreed with regards to our opinion of film we loved it the action was impressive the jokes were funny and the characters were likable the main area of criticism have seen so far seems to be that this movie does not deserve to be held in the same regard as other high scoring films on this website all can say is that this film is pure and simple fun it is well worth the money and is well worth your time to go and see film doesn have to be meaningful or deep to be great it just has to be an experience and the jaw dropping excitement felt towards the climax of this film is not something will soon forget ', ' ve been struggling for while now with superhero movies m really into fantasy and science fiction and most of my friends like superhero movies this supposedly being the ultimate superhero movie gave it go there are some good things to be said for the avengers the special effects are quite decent there are some funny moments and actors like johanson and hiddleston do an awesome job however simply can fathom how people can so tremendously and even zealously enjoy movie without story in effect what this movie does is tie together couple of superheroes introduce threat to earth and spin that around for 2 5 hours into some unnecessarily long action sequences and don even get me started on all the major plot holes it is shame that for all the money that goes into big production like this it seems they didn spare any to hire some half decent writers ', ' this show is so relatable to people of cultural religious background people that do not have culture religious associations cannot relate protagonist handling social life and cultural identity on top of that have dreams and inspiration is what make kamala different kamala is basically one of us nerds who happened to have powers the trajectory of her show will change and mark my words she gonna be the highlight of the marvels movie ', ' skip the 1st 16 minutes of your watching with kids it not good for kids to know about child trafficking and being split apart from their family and friends ', ' how ironic the show called ms marvel is actually the story of how became dc fan this show turns ms marvel into green lantern while making bunch of pretty cartoons happen in the background to distract you from the fact that not much is happening with the story it like the screenwriters poured tube of glitter on very blank piece of paper the villains are very one dimensional and the family is very stereotypical and none of the characters go through any archs or development not recommend ', ' this is great action movie brought out things we all might not have known hate done if the critics views as they are stilted this is movie to see abs enjoy on the big screen no more ad don want to add spoilers ', ' was very excited about this loved daredevil and then jessica jones and luke cage iron fist was disappointment but after seeing punisher in daredevil and having seen the movie was very excited to watch this so turned it on on day when had lot of spare time just so that can watch at least two episodes and enjoy it and it was just huge disappointment it doesn get you involved as much as the others and the story is kind of crappy didn even watch 2 episodes that day kept playing it throughout the next few days while was at the house doing chores just as background but it so bland that it just doesn keep your attention you just feel like you could be doing something else instead of watching it don even know what episode am on now don care probably will see the whole thing eventually but who knows when saw the whole season of trailer park boys though that was pretty damn good especially compared to the punisher ', ' there where sooooo many ridiculous scenes that was laughing almost non stop thought that this movie is action adventure thing that if marvel will continue and make such kind of movies they should change from action adventure to comedy movies because black widow is one of the funniest and fiction movie they have ever made including wandavision they spend so much money to make this disappointment of movie at one point and after it just sad the things they try to pass on to people as normal just sad and disappointing ', ' won go into the ins and outs of the plot ll just say brie larson despite widespread negativity was great as the most powerful of them all onward to her second outing in the blue gold and red inside 2 months can wait to see where marvel studios take her after endgame ', ' ok imma be honest didn think this show was gonna be incredible or anything went into it with pretty decent expectations but this show completely blew them out the water alot of people say it only for the younger crowd but feel like there is ton an older crowd can definitely enjoy toothe way it shot and the creative detail and just over all style and flair and the direct is just so incredible marvel has made stuff with distinct and creative visuals before but this is like whole new level also just love the relatablity of it all like you don have to actually be brown teenage girl to understand the feeling for disappointment and hurting your parents wanting to go to an event like concert or convention navigation friendships getting your liecense being dragged on shopping trips by your mom etc etc etc it just such breath of fresh air and besides no way home to first marvel thing ve really loved and absolutely cannot wait for the ready of it ', ' everybody seems to like this film don i respect everyone opinion but must say m little puzzled by the public response to what consider to be just an average popcorn movie the storyline is weak but everyone seems to agree that it isn the most important element of the film its major points are 1 the action 2 the relationships between the characters with regard to the action scenes felt nothing but indifference the main reason is that can stand cgi everything seems flat and unreal and the avengers is cgi fest if you like that sort of thing you ll love it if you are an old school action movie lover you ll probably be bored as for the relationships between the main characters was even more disappointed dialogues in the film are just an endless series of supposedly funny jokes the entire movie plays as very loud and expensive comedy can stand robert downey jr anymore someone had said that he is tony stark but the fact is that tony stark is robert downey jr he not playing character he just being wise ass actually he does it in every movie he in it unbearable the other characters are equally bland except for tom hiddleston loki this man a great actor and maybe mark ruffalo david banner hulk overall was bored and even embarrassed to watch the movie even though m aware that have the minority opinion ', ' loved it great chemistry and compelling characters ', ' my wife and took my daughters to see captain marvel the movie was really good we all enjoyed it thought brie larson did great job sometimes felt she was little awkward in scenes but mean wouldn you be awkward if you were carol danvers and were dealing with an identity crisis well played brie samuel jackson is awesome as always goose the cat added some fun for everyone as well all the hype surrounding this movie and what brie said was all s just trolls looking for reason to troll and most people took their bait think for yourself go see it with an open mind then make your own decision dont let social media decide for you my daughters are 7 and 3 and loved seeing brie represent badass woman just as have always loved seeing batman wolverine and hulk we as family cant wait to see her slap thanos around loved it and would see it again ', ' black widow was unfortunately bit disappointing but still had fun watching it scarlett johansson is of course great as black widow but florence pugh portrayal of yelena is outstanding also loved the bond between yelena and natasha scarlett as they are sarcastic yet charismatic together alongside with the chemistry between rachel weisz and david harbour who is hilarious in the film but my big issue with black widow is that it mostly feels like what you expect from marvel movie with some of the over the top action scenes with fights explosions and epic orchestral including teaming up with people at secret base and having them help the protagonist in the climax there also is humor as you would expect from marvel movie laughed at some of the jokes and implied humor but it felt little too constant overall wouldn say black widow is one of the best superhero movies unfortunately but still would recommend it to marvel fans ', ' got to see sneak preview tonight in 3d it really does have everything great action movie needs the story was good lots of kudos to the director joss for making it an amazing movie there were moments of intense action scenes of sharp humor and each character got to show their strength in very good way and not just the physical portion of it can wait to watch it again to see everything didn catch the first time this will hopefully blow away the critics of the comic book genre and make new fans it really brought lot of what the avengers is to the screen can wait to see what next ', ' season one and two are great season three was complete joke it like it was completely difference show ', ' thought it was better then almost half the other movies marvel has done so really enjoyed it good storyline acting new characters plenty of action as well def worth the watch and rewatches ', ' and boy did they this is amazing it starts off nice and it keeps getting better by the episode honestly had my doubts love marvel but they just kinda do the same thing over and over again plus didn know what to think of charlie cox but do now he perfect for it so are the rest of the cast this show believe it or not has much darker tone than the movies and welcome it just finished the second season what ride all can say is without complicating things is watch the show you will absolutely not regret it sure gave it 9 10 because of course it has flaws but they are tiny ', ' this show does not give you the same atmosphere as all mcu projects it feels serrated and too corny not very realistic when it comes to the atmosphere they try to set knew this would bomb from day one ', ' captain marvel has been brought to kill thanos means all earlier superheroes were useless in front of thanos to defeat only thanos now there are more than 20 superheroes after endgame thanos will be remembered as cult feagure who tried to do honest work by wrong methods the dangerous power of captain marvel explicitly say us that what happens when power and mind help villain like thanos it doesn matter that thanos has infinity stones but has dedicated desire thanos will be defeated in avengers endgame not because he will be less powerful but he is satisfied because he has achieved his goal he will be an ideal for the avengers so that they always remember their mistakes and the reality of our environment ', ' m coming out straight up to say this is he most freaking amazing comic movie adaptation have ever seen best movie of 2012 best marvel adaptation ever have to say what he freaking fuzz can believe ve just seen movie as great as this from hollywood where could it ever go wrong from cast ensemble to character arc to character development to story to omg spectacular kick ass action pause to catch my breath my mind is still spiraling from what have just seen this is movie want to watch this next minute if have he chance my only downside to this movie though is not seeing it in time oops ha that is no downer to he movie itself it made me laugh get tear eyed marvel in wonder at pure awesomeness jump out of my seat tremble in fear its just great sorry can find he words still as large as he hype to this movie is it still didn do justice to how awesome this movie is gosh great job joss whedon he really is passionate comic book writer who does justice to this ensemble shuffling up things to boiling point between characters and can even start to describe his major villain whose actor gives an oscar worthy performance never had bad ass bad guy that kept me awestruck this much since he matrix tom hiddlestone does justice to this character in way that truly signifies real god of mischief scheming and plotting with thoughts and plans coming at split second intervals tom hiddlestone still gives his character that dynamism of brainiac with deep inner pain that you think could boil over at any moment mind blowing movie for super hero generation if are comic book fan you would drool over this movie and m not just saying if you are not even there no reason why you shouldn watch this movie still it just couldn go wrong panting ', ' disney and mcu is turning to complete trash wish we could ve found way to keep stan lee alive forever so that kevin fege or whatever his name is not worth spelling correctly could stop destroying the marvel legacy with this muck ', ' david harbour carried the movie if not him and the 10 dollars paid would of stop watching ', ' the show pace is pretty atrocious the content and the quality is not quite there it feels like the show is just trying tick boxes to satisfy certain group of people overall think the show is targeted at the younger audience which is fine it feels cheap and forced rate it cw kids show out of 10 ', ' truly appalling mess designed for 8 year old girls and misses even that terrible concept plot script destroyed in the editing awful fx graphics and not to spoil but why was the scene with the cats flirkin include sympathy vote and then the whole section on the 2nd at risk planet the old tv series adidge applies if your series is failing drop in musical episode well here we are in very expensive movie this was when many left summary movie without heart no one involved and certainly not the script had any heart this is barren dry hole as highly educated old very old male who has watched every major sifi and fantasy movie since 2001 et and close encounters including all the star wars and marvels movies and tv shows this film is by far the worse ', ' we just saw actions and all it didn make sense to me looks so low budget and the characters had less emotions on their face dosed off like 2 times seeing the movie it was very difficult to understand the movie as no main story ', ' the only good thing about this movie is the 90 nostalgia other than that it a basic sci fi movie with the marvel brand slapped onto it ', ' know its too soon to judge but after seeing the 1st episode feel that marvels story line keeps going down phase 1 2 and 3 had some interesting story line great action sequences amazing actors its true that mcu needed more gender representation but recent shows are just not up to the standard cant even compare the recent shows with movies like black widow or shang chi great movies and good representation of different communities or shows like agents of shield or loki ', ' this film is agenda driven what laugh had watching it the dads dumb mums super intelligent girls unstoppable and unfortunately mainstream bias against males ', ' personal am big fan of marvel but this session is very boaring and poor and acting and also story is also not interesting this series is waste of time only ', ' it was too bad movie to be befitting marvel quality if we remove the cgi scenes the movie will be about 3 minutes in total the script is bad the acting is bad it a bad movie ', ' this was really good film in the cinema as it set in between captain america civil war and avengers infinity war it would probably have made more sense to have made this film prior to infinity war however really good watch great characters and made me laugh several times ', ' found this series quite boring honestly prefer iron fist ', ' positives 1 action scenes 2 funny moments negatives 1 too emotional 2 sometimes unrealistic ', ' m not huge fan of action movies and m not familiar with the marvel universe at all but enjoyed this movie it has good pace variety of settings and good dialogues and lot of action the one scene that dragged on bit too long was the family reunion scene the scenes with the robotised henchman were also bit hard to believe thought would be lost at the beginning knowing nothing abouut marvel but the story unfolds quite naturally ve never heard of the red room dragov not even the avengers but that wasn a problem to understand and to enjoy the story loved some of the plot twists never dull moment in this film maybe should check out another marvel movie ', ' watched this to see how marvel intended to move forward with the mcu having chosen to interweave their tv shows and films this film is one of the worst films have ever seen at no point did feel gripped by anything that was happening was not endeared to any of the characters including samuel jackson who until recently was on top form as nick fury why was this film even made it feels like filler as though the folks at marvel stopped trying after having had multiple successes culminating in end game captain marvel excluded that was also soulless debacle and decided they were untouchable and that we were all going lap up whatever they put out from there on bree larson attempts to exhibit more emotion in this film compared to the wooden performance she gave us in captain marvel but still comes across cold arrogant and ultimately unpleasant nick fury is babysitter here nick fury one of the coolest characters in marvel has been reduced to grumpy babysitter who just wants some peace can believe this is what has become of franchise that dominated the box office for decade this film is pointless it trys to be fun and fails the special fx are poor for marvel and the cast and story are flat shan be giving anymore of my time of money to this franchise marvel ended with end game ', ' can enjoy it but tried was expecting to see something like the arrow and the flash series have to offer the heroes fighting known villains from the comics but alas where are they in this show it started out good but soon enough you get to see that is all about that skye character skye not only being bland character is also not interesting don care who or what she is m not interested in her background at all want to see villains and heroes that we are sure will never get debut on the silver screen want to see the minor heroes and villains want to see epic fights not personal drama only come on ', ' watch if you like gritty netflix originals like daredevil any of the wonderful jessica jones cast members action television that still manages to develop its characters and personal relationships it hard to believe that jessica jones exists in the same universe as the avengers there is complexity and darkness in jessica jones that is simply not present in the massive big budget films there is graphic content that is used to tell story that would be inappropriate and unappealing for the family audience of previous marvel projects with the exception of daredevil however for those who fall into the target audience they will not be disappointed the way in which jessica jones uses graphic content bold dialogue and solid story lines is one that is both unsettling and entirely addictive in many ways the show is like jessica herself gritty testy and unsure at times but also entertaining likable and extremely strong it is the balance of these attributes that makes the character of jessica as portrayed wonderfully by krysten ritter and her equally interesting cohorts the driving force behind the stable and interesting yet not extremely original or remarkable storyline overall jessica jones is able to do what so many action movies and television shows have failed to do it has captured the audience attention using violence and graphic content while still remaining very much character driven while the story lines may be considered average at best by some the writers are able to successfully tell story that is simultaneously surreal and deeply personal that victory alone makes it worth the watch ', ' can see this being loved by niche market mostly young teenage girls and maybe the ethnic group it based upon however for the rest of us it not what we are used too in other words don expect the usually high calibrate marvel product instead expect story about love struck young muslim girl trying to live out her dreams ', ' first have to say that enjoy the show but must say that from the beginning do not like karen page too much drama and hated the fact that she got more and more involved in the show is all that drama needed ', ' brie larson is horrible actress as captain marvel no emotions no acting no motivation thrre is no anything good in this film horrible direction absolutely disappointing movie the dc wonder woman with beautiful gal gadot is much better captain marvel is the most poor and worst movie at marvel univers brie is horrible ', ' so disappointed in these reviews this movie had action comedy and plot just like every other marvel movie that had every other dude screaming it praises in the past brie larson did an excellent job playing badass woman who didn need to have sex appeal in order to be powerful read lot of reviews saying how she had no emotion throughout the film however this is completely contradictory to the theme throughout the movie where her one weakness is that she lets her emotions control her actions as human beings think we can all agree that she does not need to show her emotions in order to be feeling them and know that if her character were man we would not even be having this discussion in the first place lol forward to her reprising captain marvel in the next avengers movie and it about damn time movie like this was made ', ' disappointed expected more form this movie after endgame movie was no of marvel level ', ' it beautiful excellent writing excellent showing of my pakistani culture and the best version of ms marvel if the ratings were out of 100 would give it 1 000 it deserves more praise then it is being given now ', ' where to start very cheap story bad acting cant understand other people reviews especially about florence acting she have so stubborn face exprecions anoying voice overal sarcasm all the time through the movie and not funny at all in any moment to much talking and almost none action avoid this at any stake dont waste money in cinema ', ' m tired of all the haters this marvel movie is better than the last few it was action packed it tied in wandavison and ms marvel into the marvels it hinted the young avengers was coming you even got surprise in the post credits it was better than the last antman thor and eternals movies really didn like secret invasion and she hulk so you have an understanding of where m coming from just because you have female lead cast don mean it will suck the marvels was way better than captain marvel in my opinion hope they have more adventures because they made great team so watch it ', ' welp don think anyone thought this was going to be smash hit but this was just surprisingly terrible just steaming mess totally boring and worn out plot edited to the point where it feels like lot is missing but somehow you are also relieved because you don really want any more either characters are unengaging and frankly not likeable or interesting brie larson still can act her way out of paper bag and has stopped even pretending to look interested in what she is doing you get the vibe that she shot this on lunch break from some other thing she actually wanted to be doing total waste of time miss this one ', ' the first few minutes of the show were bit rough for me because it a bit corny but as the show goes on it can be very heartfelt really like so how to show is dealing with her struggle between being young teenager and her parents traditional views you can tell how much they love her but the cultural differences are very hard for them people giving this bad rating are forgetting that it is made for kids and so far really enjoy the message can wait to see how the show goes on the show is like young teenager scott pilgrim vs the world ', ' as fan of all comic boooks for nearly 40 years was extremely excited when netflix began daredevil loved the first season particularly because of the way both matt murdock and wilson fisk were portrayed finally it was the murdock and fisk that had grown up with then came jessica jones lower tier marvel character who is now on the list thanks to stellar first season now comes the second season of daredevil and it is the best yet it is not spoiler to say that the second season includes elektra and the punisher elodie yung plays elektra perfectly hitting every level of pathos brutal and dangerous when it is called for but under the surface is heroic and even sympathetic warrior john bernthal brings to frank castle aka the punisher what always should have been there rage with heroism buried beneath forget thomas jane or even ray stevenson who gave his best to what he was given finally we have the defining punisher can say enough about the other stand out performances but once again matt foggy and karen are pitch perfect the twist at the end of episode 8 will blow you away and the verbal confrontation between two characters in episode 10 is emmy worthy if had but one complaint it would be lighting when daredevil is fighting battles at night d like to be able to actually see them this was problem in season 1 as well but it is minor when balanced with the overall quality of the show bring on the defenders because the man without fear is more than ready season 2 of daredevil brings the comics to life and is the best tv offering marvel has given us yet ', ' 1st season was pretty good after that it a downward slide into terrible acting and worse writing by the end of the series almost no character is likeable what wasted opportunity for something good ', ' very weak strange meaningless film for the marvel cinematic universe and in principle no one needs it as fan of the cinematic universe you try in vain to grab onto something to justify the time spent watching it but unfortunately nothing weak computer graphics incomprehensible motivation of the characters except for ms marvel apparently since she quite realistically portrays child who meets an idol frankly flat acting by almost the entire cast scrapped nick fury frankly uninteresting plot in the end the positives were highlight just some of the jokes and the charisma of kamala khan family ', ' the lack of inspiration is visible from the beginning as the first scenes and the opening credits are copy tribute to the americans tv series rest of the movie features nice cgi fights but then again uninspired as the only difference between the all women assassin team and regular assassin team is to have women instead of men m simplifying of course but widows could be replaced by widowers without major changes to the scripts ', ' after hearing my family rave about how incredible awesome amazing blah blah blah this movie was my wife and went to see it we are huge marvel fans and we were excited to see the movie our expectations simply were not met relative to all the hype and this film is not worthy of an 8 6 rating it a very good movie but not great by any means here the good and the bad the good the special effects were outstanding as you would expect the acting was also nicely done the script was somewhat well paced although we both felt it started fairly slowly the movie did had some of the funniest moments of any super hero film ve seen the storyline was ok but that brings me to the bad the bad the storyline was just ok won spoil the movie but suffice it to say the anti heroes motivations were somewhat silly to me that said it follows somewhat to the comic storyline so the plot was never really all that interesting to begin with the actors and directors did the best they could with the plot but was never pulled into the story that deeply nor did it strike any emotional connection or interest for me it was just great action movie that was well acted with reasonable script avengers is very good action film and worthy of seeing on the big screen however to see this film rated so close to the dark night is preposterous those films are in totally different leagues ', ' season 1 was good but season 2 and 3 are an insult they should have just ended it after s1 ', ' enjoyed this movie it an ok movie the kind of movie that would ve gone under the radar if it wasn because it ties to the avengers and the polemic around brie larsson persona if anything captain marvel piggy bagged on the avengers fandom because otherwise mist people wouldn be interested in this version of female superman samuel jackson the cat and the aliens save the movie and make it worth the ticket not so much the captain marvel character and her story line ', ' god miss daredevil such great show great acting great fight scenes great atmosphere great everything ', ' another steaming pile of cr from disney who seem to have the heart set on producing nothing but bland drivel yet again the agenda is clear as day no effort put into decent story telling the 1 dimensional characters are only there to push narative ', ' the way they made this colors graphics it just shows what going on in kamala mind it shows how big of fan she is of avengers it charming and heartwarming to see ', ' this felt all over the place the fighting scenes were horrible ve seen old western movies with better fight scenes this movie felt like this was written by teenagers to obsessed with ideas of trying to make it awesome in their own eye just throwing ideas like this would be cool if we did this they had singing in the movie again just felt all over the place trying to please everyone by trying to clicking off every box they thought would amuse the audience at best this movie was ok but nothing worse than 3 out of 10 with 5 being ok the new characters felt rushed and were just flip flopping left and right this movie felt very rushed like this could ve been easily 3 movies over time but they decided naw we ll just throw it in blender and see what happens ', ' season 1 dragged at points but picked up points with grit and action season 2 was pure american junk like an american car it looked good but had no substance or point poor quality and boring waste of time utterly disappointed that another good show is ruined by the need to accomodate the unintelligent masses guns no logic no intelligence endlessly pointless plot lines midany billy russo so bad so boring and predictable such shame ', ' do really like this show they constantly work at keeping it interesting with plot changes the characters evolve while still maintaining familiarity the only thing that drives me nuts is them constantly throwing in unnecessary political jabs can not just watch show that has nothing to do with political without politics randomly being thrown in ', ' bad move to stop this great entertainment and an excellent female lead ', ' not sure who this is for not your typical marvel fan imagine it pure garbage at best only one episode in and m pretty sure it will only get worse ', ' summary d say that people who have never heard of dd or read any comics would still be able to watch and potentially enjoy this programme series 1 is compelling viewing series 2 is all build up and no pay off there isn a great plot so we re left to only care about the characters who are inconsistently written sans dd himself as say above the series is very much character driven instead of story driven the emotional stakes for the city of new york are practically non existent and the villain end games are never fully realised with this being the case then quick summary of each character spoiler warning daredevil matt murdoch charlie cox is excellent in the role and hits it pitch perfectly there is none of the martyrdom we see from bruce wayne or clark kent in murdoch and none of the confused one step behind the villain buggery that you see in most other superheroes when he daredevil it worrying however that the blind man running around the city in pyjamas is the most sane and relatable character in the series foggy nelson lawyer matt business partner comic relief and poor at it to boot later in s1 starts behaving like wife going through menstruation and projecting husbandry onto matt his partner in their law firm it so hokey and unbelievable that criminal lawyer as foggy is could be that naive about the issues that cause contention karen page burdensome legal assistant someone that desperately needs institutionalising the character goes through personal tumult and trauma early in series 1 and uses this as nice jumping board for descending into fits of either euphoria or hysteria depending on how intensely foggy or matt whom her romantic interest flits between eyeball her alternates between wanting to bang nelson or murdoch and treating the two like they are her parents on the verge of divorce really poorly written an emotional wreck in each episode and given far too much screen time ben urich internet hating journo nolan esque character that so world weary and depressing you think he might just sigh out his inner organs he believable though and plenty brave he fits in nicely with how they ve painted the city wilson fisk kingpin antagonist big bald bastard with constant does my end justify my means doggerel flowing out of him he a good character and good actor plays him but it just too intense and silly man with emotions this out of control could never rise to the position he occupies plus we never get any context about how powerful he is in comparison to the other crime lords in ny half the time seems furious half the time seems terrified all the time seems sad and little bit bored claire token marvel sassy woman nurse the worst character by country mile dd saves room full of kids from torture and death and gets them to the hospital for her to treat in secret she thanks him and comments that he saved lives tonight later dd is on the roof of the hospital advising claire that he needs to keep watch as the kids captors will try to steal them back claire then gives him lengthy and naive lecture about the city not needing him and matt being martyr having messiah complex and when he refuses to come downstairs and join the rest of the humans she leaves him where he is shaking her head as she goes in the very next scene the hospital is besieged by the child swiping ninja and her friend gets butchered because dd couldn get to her in time she then very nearly gets killed herself mean seriously seriously worst of all she doesn even repent afterwards and the audience gets no closure because she doesn acknowledge her own foolishness and matt heroism quite the opposite in fact frank castle the punisher bernthal is perfect for the role just awesome physical specimen of sublime ferocity with demeanour of pure unstoppable retribution driven rage his character biggest problem we are shown time and again how cartoonishly depraved the criminal denizens of this new york city are and yet we are expected to have questions about the morality of castle actions because he kills those whom he knows have wronged others he the harsh antidote to all of the cringey naive friends of matt that think the impossibly corrupt legal system still has all the answers and that it not up to vigilante to save people lives nah matt let that little girl get butchered in front of her family we need you to come out for beer tonight wish was joking elektra natchios member of the 1 not as pretty as others seem to think psychotic manipulative completely selfish and utterly without redeeming qualities does what she does because she likes it and not necessarily because it does good for the world terrible that she and punisher co exist in the same series they re only slight variants of each other overall it is compelling viewing but binge watching it will leave you more than little confused about why each character behaves the way they do stupidly as it already on netflix and as such free would recommend it ', ' this is one of the first series watched on netflix and yet one of the best after many years the story of matt murdock is commonly known amongst marvel fans and the ones who were enough ill fated to see that horrible ben affleck movie if you belong to the latter mentioned please do me favour forget the movie and dive right into this amazing tv series marvel daredevil has everything it needs to enter your heart and gain special spot in it forever drama crime the right amount of violence great actors an amazing plot run by flawless direction and captivating soundtrack to merge all this into an incredible product the best mention goes first off to the script never boring difficult to predict and surprisingly deep and mature for superhero driven story first and third season are full fledged crime story where narration owns the stage also thanks to great cast heroes and villains altogether second season is bit more action oriented but it does introduce one of the most brutal yet emphatic and human antiheroes ever frank castle aka the punisher the second mention need to make goes to the cast charlie cox suits perfectly as matt murdock almost as they wrote the character for him and his co stars deborah ann woll and elden enson play their supportive roles exceptionally making you feel like they really are the dysfunctional family you witness on screen regarding the villains think you ll agree with me when say you can hardly find such complex and fascinating criminal character as vincent onofrio wilson fisk on screen his work as daredevil nemesis has rightly gained the favor of the critics last but not least jon bernthal as the punisher never before ve known comic character portrayed on screen and thought that him just as imagined as saw it for the first time in action it like jon really is the punisher and it is soooo good to see him on screen as supporting role in daredevil and even better as the main one in his self titled show in conclusion this is masterpiece to me and it a real shame the show got canceled after three seasons damn you disney but let look at the silver lining we could have had none so hurry up join netflix and watch this show the devil of hell kitchen deserves this ps if you love fighting and martial arts as well daredevil really kicks ass ', ' enjoy season 1 avoid season 2 as it was painful to get through hopefully season 3 will sort itself out and you can watch the recap and dodge s2 ', ' love the style and direction of the show all the whiners here prove the point how marvel archived making show that is not the 112th repetition of their formula but something both young girls and old gen farts like me can enjoy ', ' when saw the trailer for jessica jones was excited for the series it was very entertaining but this show has big problems if don call it for what it is nobody else will so im just going to tell you exactly what the writers of the script already know blasphemy is the act of insulting or showing contempt or lack of reverence for god this series has 13 episodes and counted at least 3 of the major characters continuing to take the lord name in vain time after time in every single episode they really do go out of their way to take the lord name in vain this tells me that majority of the people involved in the series are more than likely satanic the big hollywood director is always the guy seen in pictures wearing his alister crowley shirt and since crowley was devil worshiping lunatic he did everything in his power to defy the one true god exodus 20 7 says thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain actors and actresses are professionals so when they get into character they know exactly what they are doing right say hold them accountable for what they say in these movies and television shows as well even if the writer of the script is satanic and you are getting paid to play role it doesn mean you have to say yes to everything they are asking you to do does it bother them to do these things it bothers me to watch it every time they took the lord name in vain felt it and after was finished with the 13 episodes felt really dirty for viewing it if counted the amount of times they did it the number would probably be about 100 there is an old saying in the recording industry what type of sorcery is this well we know exactly what type of sorcery jessica jones is the satanic hollywood agenda is working in full force and this is the most blasphemous script have ever seen in the history of television don care how great the acting and the story was because the true message behind this trash was made loud and clear am sure the atheists the devil worshipers and pagans can wait to tear me apart for this review however according to the bible only god can judge me if you don see the staggering amount of satanic influence going on in hollywood would encourage you to really open up your eyes and be more perceptive about what you are seeing on the television screen ', ' was really excited at first but hardly able to keep up till 20 mins because wanted to give it chance will not continue watching it any further that for sure if had to watch slow pace house hold story wouldn have clicked marvel or dc in the first place like the doodles tho 3 star for that ', ' like the other marvel movies you get what you pay for no big surprises and stuff but great entertainment ', ' does my tv keep switching to the cw channel whenever try to watch ms marvel or maybe it syfy or possibly lifetime is the oprah channel still thing it certainly not the same channel that produced moon knight ', ' although would have loved to beans and cheese all over this show they only really talked about the legacy of wandavision not how they made it that about all have to say beans and cheese ', ' iron fist not so good luke cage little better daredevil and jessica jones pretty damn good but all hail the punisher there aren enough words to describe how great this show is gritty violent dramatic and well acted action packed and pulls no punches it delivers and then some just watch it ', ' ms marvel is show that was not one bit excited for but it ended up really surprising me and from the first episode onward actually really liked this show it a show that perfectly pokes fun and makes light of the 90 and 2000 disney channel shows such as lizzie maguire and it ends up having lot of fun while also being very serious at some parts it hard to believe iman vellani doesn have any previous acting experience because believe she will be future star of the mcu she is fantastic as kamala khan perfectly bringing the childish aspects of superheroes like spider man and human torch while also giving us real relatable character to look up to ms marvel is great character in this series and all the side characters have perfect chemistry with her especially bruno who was once again played excellently by matt lintz and it also has one of the biggest twist endings in mcu history in the final episode while episode 5 was pretty messy episode 6 did really good job wrapping up this series and also teasing one of the best superhero teams of all time no spoilers m gonna give ms marvel an ', ' the only thing like about the show is the scenery lighting onto the rest typical 1980 pi script pi is suffering lost loved one or insert your tragedy here always speaks monotone and burst into offices drowns sorrow by drinking heavily and ignoring real life did mention the monotone dialog she always has it so bad that turned it off this show is just as bad as the rest typical story lines bad cgi and actors who seem to be confused with the roles characters are difficult to warm up to the industry keeps churning out these horrible shows and people just keep accepting it ', ' have never seen it why missed why it a great movie for me but you maybe like it if you be one in black widow fans funny part is so smooth it suppose to be no 1 movie forever in mcu ', ' don understand what point this show is trying to make super slow and boring without anything deep ok identity d suggest never have ever instead of this embarrassing kid show ', ' wow was looking forward to watching this for long time it definitely no daredevil the acting in this is so bad it just so over blown and melodramatic that at times you just want to stop watching ended up watching 9 10 episodes due to the fact it may overlap with daredevil well there is no way m going through another season of this crap again trust me when say this there is no comparison to the daredevil series the daredevil series is 10 this is no more than 4 as mentioned earlier it due to the horrible acting the writing is horrible as well the villain is okay but he no kingpin they portrayed her powers horribly just found this show too boring and unwatchable ', ' seriously thought she hulk was bad the eternals had better plot more action and better acting do love them trying to branch the mcu universe but isn the tva supposed to step in and stop these rogue branches loki you are needed on set end this madness already or have carol danvers show up take the bracelet and give it to thanos the story line sucks the acting is ever worse the stereotypes are louder than sony walkman wanted to give it chance the trailers looked promising but in the first 42 seconds of the show we completely learned the ultimate question why disney why ', ' this show is so relatable to my real life and appreciate marvel to showing accurate pakistani immigrant family and also love iman acting her expressions ', ' in the jungle of predominantly weak superhero movies one day they will laugh at our decade saying didn they know how to make any other films this one actually has heart florence pugh is awesome in both comedy and emotion rachel wiesz can convey every emotion with sinle glance scarlett johansson is fragile and forceful and even the guy playing their dad was funny there is big part of this movie that is actually movie not just fights and stuff blowing up and that part was excellent good dialogue connection to characters then there was the big final battle and that just went overboard felt like there were levels and every win made restart in lose position on another level the cgi was not all that fabulous either was really sick of the fight sequence when it was coming to the end too long too unrealistic neverending thank god they stuck piece of actual movie at the end of it still the red room storyline has little too much of dystopian feel for my taste kinda depressing florence pugh character really should be developed in further films she is excellent and her dialogue delivery in the russian accent is to die for is there any way she and jensen ackles can be cast together in flick with good script they would be so fantastic as they are the same kind of comedy drama geniuses ', ' great film to watch with your family the plot is very good with villain that has something else on their mind that just power the chemistry between the three main characters is great the script is full of silly jokes that make you laugh out loud more than once action scenes are also very well choreographed it seems like good change of gears for the mcu really hope that we get some more like this in the near future it not just superhero movie there are some deeper meaning under that comic it more about how to open to people you care about and how that makes you stronger rather than weaker ', ' there is one question that have never found reasonable answer to it imagine someone prepares lot of food and drinks and arranges very nice decoration and when he was asked what is the reason of this party and who are going to come and he replied no reason and nobody now back to the movie business when there is no script or story line what is the reason for the big budget and preparation this marvels is just satire of captain marvel just quick look at its cheap comedy and just imagine there are dancing and singing in the marvel universe in the scene of cats would not be surprised if see garfield in that between ', ' following the success of iron man 2008 marvel comics came up with the idea of putting all superheroes together in the avengers sequel to iron man and films like thor also played their part in building excitement in the run up to the film release its biggest star robert downey jr reprises his role as tony stark iron man and has scarlett johansson as natalia romanoff black widow who had role in iron man 2 for company there gwyneth paltrow in brief role as pepper potts also from the marvel universe there chris hemsworth as thor tom hiddleston as his brother the villain loki samuel jackson as nick fury director of shield chris evans as steve rogers captain america mark ruffalo as dr bruce banner hulk and jeremy renner as clint barton hawkeye are the other first billed actors the story starts at secret facility where scientists are researching on an unknown energy source the tesseract then things go awry and portal is opened up allowing norse god loki to come through and evil loki plans to use the power source team up with an alien race called the chitauri and subjugate earth with the world on the verge of falling apart nick fury can only rely on his superheroes to save the world but getting these larger than life characters with massive egos to work together proves to be tougher than it seems the rest of the story plays on the good vs bad theme replete with action stunts and cool gadgets the film selling point is not its theme but the way they go about telling the story for one it doesn have heroes coming together spontaneously making speeches about good and bad and then going all out battling the bad guy here they are shown to have their own issues and obviously issues with one another the altercation between characters gives us some really nice one liners one of my favorites was when captain america asks tony stark iron man big man in suit of armor take that away what are you to which stark responds uh genius billionaire playboy philanthropist with his usual arrogance the avengers is also visual treat filmed on digital media it was converted to 3d in post production and was digitally remastered to imax format the special effects are state of the art and offer edge of the seat action although watched it on regular screen with 3d it would definitely be worthwhile on imax since it is based on comic book theme and superhero theme there are those who may choose to skip on the pretext that comics are just for kids ah get over this idea and let the avengers overwhelm you with its action and fantasy ', ' her performance was forced uninspiring and flat not looking forward to the next movie with her in it ', ' lot of reviews are from people angry about female lead under the guise of attacking pacing cinematography or brie larsen acting ignore them as the first female led mcu film to date captain marvel sets high standard for female leads and origin stories alike without giving any spoilers captain marvel acquires and learns about her powers at rate consistent with the tone of the film and the overall feel of the mcu as whole brie larsen and samuel jackson both deliver consistently wonderful performances that express their characters and the supporting kree skrull and humans of the film are similarly well acted the music generally suits to the vibe of the action onscreen and reinforces the 90s throwback setting some reviews claim there is an in your face feminist agenda there isn it a film about female superhero learning her place in the world learning to overcome struggles both personal and from things larger than herself and few moments that mirror the everyday experiences of modern women it empowering not preachy all in all captain marvel is great film and definitely worthy collection in the mcu it may not quite be my 1 but it easily top 5 ', ' the punisher has been on my list to watch for while and finally got round to it and what show it is it starts off little slow in season 1 but when it gets into its stride it certainly gets into its stride jon bernthal is truly amazing as the punisher such great actor think there also great supporting cast it very violent in places but don mind that and the action scenes are great but it not all action as there a good storyline for both seasons and good character development let just hope they make third season now it on disney ', ' have enjoyed all of the marvel and dc based shows until now thought the ben afleck daredevil was bad but this is just painful cant help but wonder if the good reviews are for arrow or the flash and left here by mistake its just bad started this after finished the new episodes of agents of shield flash gotham and the arrow after the others had great hopes for daredevil but after 2 episodes almost wish was blind and deaf this show might be good some day as rifftrax or mst3k fodder if mst3k comes back but as stand alone show it does not cut it if can not an alternative may be forced to actually start reading books ', ' ms marvel is story about race not only do we encounter the pakistani family in the us and the rather ordinary cultural and racial themes but we also deal with interdimensional races and the same problems of not belonging appreciated the race topic and was able to relate to it lot being also the son of an immigrant though it was rather stereotypical and nothing out of the ordinary the plot itself however was quite mundane the villains feel weak and unmotivated and so does the entire backstory of course there needed to be fight with the love interest but the high point was resolved too quickly and randomly we don even really know why these special forces were there and kamala powers feel random there are weird location and time jumps and one wonders what happened in between the show is called ms marvel but up till now there are few connections to captain marvel sure she likes captain marvel and her name means marvel but other than that it was such clichee ending to have the father tell her that she ms marvel m pretty disappointed and was quite bored watching this show ', ' this is by far one of the weakest and most boring mcu movies since the black panther and what bothers me is movies such as this and black panther are only praised not because of actual talent from production actors but because they uphold social justice not only was this an sjw ridden crapfest its also very boring the lead female actress is terrible monotone and immature jude law would have been far superior as the main character waste of time and money ', ' the punisher for me is almost perfect the action in this show is amazing most of the characters are developed excellently and given interesting arcs there are few side characters who felt held the show back and were overly dull but as soon as we got back to castle jon bernthal it picked up again and was hooked devoured this series over the course of two days and thoroughly enjoyed few sjw lines felt forced and out of place and you will recognize these moments when they come but apart from this small flaw loved the punisher think this is marvels second best netflix show to date beaten only by daredevil season 1 9 10 ', ' the first episode is so beautiful it looks like production by pixar marvel did lot of work not to mention the incredible performance of iman vellani ', ' this is my 2nd review of captain marvel because have more to say why in the world did marvel decide to sink to level of bad movie making that puked out justice league did they think zak snyder and company needed company am at total lost for words as to how they could screw this up so badly seeing as though all their other movies were so good have been pondering in my mind as to what is the worst thing about captain marvel since there are so many worst things have boiled it down to three 3 is the acting it lacks everything except awfulness 2 is the directing this movie was directed my children 1 is brie larson no personality no charisma no fun no life no style no charm no understanding of the character or of comic book movies this movie should drop between 60 and 80 percent in its 2nd week of release justice league was so horrible that it should have made no more than 350 million worldwide in its entire run captain marvel should do no better than 400 million in its entire run it will make much more but it shouldn this movie is absolute proof that marvel can fail and they have hope the russo brothers take charge with brie larson as captain marvel and make her rise to the level of the rest of the avengers in endgame please deliver her and us from this justice league gutter trash that we ve witnessed in this movie ', ' recently watched the marvels and have to say was extremely disappointed with the movie not only was it unorganized jumping back and forth between different timelines but the acting was subpar imani khaliani person with no acting background was poor choice for lead role and it showed in her performance it is unfair that thousands of talented acting students put in time and effort yet someone with no experience is chosen the plot was confusing and hard to follow making it difficult to fully enjoy the film overall the marvels was disappointment and would not recommend it ', ' everything was either done poorly half assed or haphazardly the only character development was done outside of the movie itself they turned nick fury into comic relief which is in direct conflict with his character in every other appearance there were so many aspects and ideas that if they flushed out and did properly or even explained in competent manner the movie wold have been passable streamed this movie through disney and still wish could have my money and time back the only thing that was nice is that brie larson felt human in this that it that the only redeeming aspect even then they didn give us nearly enough of why she better or proper character development and conflict resolution bad storytelling bad worldbuilding bad explanations if any bad antagonist development mediocre costuming decent sfx cgi for the heroes only ', ' ll explain to you folks in simple way racism and bias although the series is not perfect can assure it is beautifully executed the action really good specially from kamala the score trully amazing understand if you say that you don like the character or so like don emphatize with some mcu characters as well but don understand the hate can only assume that the bad reviews are because she is female brown and muslim some will say that disney is wrong in including controversial themes like the partition of india but strongly disagree in fact this series mande me curios about the theme and ve been reading about it since don let youserf be influenced by the bad reviews of some men in their 40 give the series chance and you will see all the effort they put in it ', ' just couldn get through it and that says lot because usually love marvel movies it was all so cringey not real background story no real emotions just badass women fighting and showing some moves all of sudden they are on some sort of mission without us even knowing what really going on this is not the one for me great idea horrible execution ', ' it a marvel movie you think with all the big budget and the fantastic story telling and the cast you get great cg effects to compliment the story crappiest big budget cg for movie of this calibre nevermind that loved the comic and action sequences top notch please work on your cg quality ', ' it like juno meets after school special the show insists itself on the obvious and the reach for the throwback is gimmicky ve never been fan of this character but really did try to enjoy this show the first episode was enough for me it reminded me of the hype of the square enix avengers videogame and then finally playing it and realizing money grab add inclusion and the current culture squabble and people sadly fall for it you think these production companies would realize by now that most people don like being forced opinions ', ' had low expectations of the film and was surprising pleased and enjoyed it the whole time florence is an absolute scene stealer followed closely by david great story and the end credit scene is awesome ', ' now this is not marvel best movie however it is nice to see the first female avenger have her own movie which is definitely very late it funny but think the only scene that is important for upcoming projects is the end credits as black widow is dead ', ' having been brown kid raised in america this show is quite accurate to that lifestyle kamala parents being pakistani cling to their values like many brown parents do and being teenager raised in american society often conflicts with that would say it is still the weakest out of all the shows at least for me it simply does not pack the same punch that the rest of them do it is an enjoyable watch with good pace my only criticism is that she should not have found it that difficult to drive car in the beginning of episode 1 ', ' the only good thing in this movie is the cat and the young nick fury anything else is just garbage have nothing more to say just speechless dont waste your time and money ', ' d watch this in timeline order if were gonna through the entire mcu again wouldn look forward to it though m surprised that scarjo took an executive credit on this because it hardly an origin story or really any story that provides interesting insight into the characters history what it is is vehicle as many of them are to setup the whatever comes next in the verse performances were fine the action was fine the pacing was ok pretty vanilla overall the only thing about the movie that really bothered me and many others was how they butchered task master the character had been portrayed many different ways from goofy henchmen to arch nemesis for some of the most popular characters in marvel without spoiling too much ll just say that nothing about this incarnation made any sense or did any justice to that character shame because tasky could have been better rogue in better movie ', ' let me start by saying loved season 1 and enjoyed season 2 but what happened netflix did you run out of ideas did disney marvel take all the rights to all the other characters the same villian who seems to have better plan than all the other characters have to say season 3 has not been up to the standards that dardevil has set you bringing back the same characters same storyline and same character controls of placing darkness over every character is getting outdated and on top of that it been stretched out to 13 episodes introduction of bullseye was much needed positive in the show that is at best mediocre from the screenplay to writing to direction the only few points that save the show are good acting by characters that have been given very little to work with in form of screenplay the storyline needs much work if season 4 is to be better showing ', ' don know watched the first show and liked the idea thought it was cool well the idea in itself is cool but there were somethings in that series that simply did not enjoy like the over use of some extremely dramatic song on scene that is of almost no importance it just felt to fake over all especially when you bring all the religion into it don mean to sound like some asshole here but really religion is just not something that is going to grasp you big audience these days well at least not in europe this series had fine story overly dramatic acting sometimes borderline bad acting well bad acting at times over dramatized scenarios some of the character interactions are weird don know it just didn fit well with me my sincere review please don hate me for it ', ' don think that this movie worth to be one of the marvel movie soo boring wasted my time and my money ', ' season 1 was all about the cat mouse game with killgrave but with season 2 noticed what powerful role malcom is ', ' think this is must watch movie am not big fan of superhero movies even tough watched it because my friends dragged me to watch it and must say didn get bored single second of it the action is awesome and the dialogs makes the movies one of the funniest movies ever the credit should go to iron man and hulk who makes it all happen through out the story just two words simply amazing there is no big difference in 3d and normal screens but max should make it look even better my rating for the movie on scale of 1 to 10 action 9 comedy 10 story 9 overall 10 because it is an excellent movie would recommend you to watch the iron man thor captain america movies before watching this if you are not good at understanding english then use subtitles because it would be shame to miss hilarious line in it ', ' m very happy jessica jones got final season before being shut down like the other netflix marvel shows enjoyed season 3 overall rachel taylor as trish and carrie anne moss as jeri gave award worthy performances the villain of foolkiller was sufficiently scary even though he wasnt super the story did lag bit in the middle but m ok with that this season raises interesting questions about what it means to be super does that mean one can take the law into their own hands and become vigilante trish says yes jessica says no and if so who gets to decide who lives and dies understand trish rage but it is slippery slope it seems that violence had become trish latest addiction that very dangerous for her and everyone around her be they guilty or innocent would liked to have seen more upbeat ending but that probably not true to jessica jones the character and the series0 ', ' it just super lame all actings dialogues scenes and so on they are all great actors but bad director could degrade all of them still don understand why even two normal humans should be in avengers between gods and super humans m guessing to promote but it a lame act this movie could be something like captain america series but they terribly failed if you don watch it you won miss anything ', ' it started really slow on season 1 kept on watching for the fact that phil coulson was in it but my god what journey the show has made for past 7 years it was emotional humorous action packed thrilling and intriguing the ending season was basically gift to long time watchers by bringing back so many old faces and story lines from previous seasons very logical and satisfying ending of the series and creating big possibility for spin offs ', ' long story short season 1 was very good didn rely on the clich superhero character and gave us more substance season 2 didn rely on the clich superhero character x10 and gave us nothing extremely poor writing period the fact that netflix and marvel think they can peddle season 2 off as entertaining just goes to show how arrogant and complacent they have become throw their labels on it we ll bite not anymore lesson learned ', ' understand why good number of people didn like this movie but for me its great its even one of my favorite mcu movies this is mainly because black widow is my favorite character and don care about taskmaster ', ' probably the biggest issue with black widow is the fact that it is clearly forced to become part of the avengers franchise the amount of plot details derived from this effort just crams up especially throughout the first half of the runtime making it near impossible to keep up with the already complicated plot moreover the main concept of the movie being really solid and grounded it feels like the whole sci fi marvel tone just didn fit in had the protagonist different name and the filmmakers not the need to satisfy the franchise needs the movie would instantly become near masterpiece and here why the technical aspect of the film is excellent precisely what one should expect from 200 million production the cinematography is spicy yet coherent doing an excellent job at creating both the suitable atmosphere and brilliant looking piece of video the visual effects well stand up to modern big budget action movie with well executed set extensions and proper simulations as for the plot the idea of bringing the aftermath of the cold war to the present day is meticulously interwoven with the topic of family the latter definitely better executed than the average budget driven cinematic disaster of our times the characters feature well written and distinct personalities and for the most part decent arcs as well the acting does no bad job of helping out in this area to mention some barely significant downsides the directing does fall behind at particular action sequences where it gets hard to even tell the two opponents apart moreover despite the plot being well structured there flow of information is not resulting in the first half of the movie sounding more like an online lecture and the second half being pure chaos finally we all know killing protagonist off in between installments is not good thing but killing them off in the final credits that a whole new level of weird choice anyway ticket to the sequel would probably be good buy for me ', ' as pakistani while feel proud of my culture being represented on global platform but to do it right is the main thing upto the third episode was loving it but the fourth episode is down right disrespectful and ugly to my culture and the ideology of pakistan it feels as if someone on purpose has tried to distort the history and the sacrifices of the millions that gave their lives during the partition partition may not be such significant event for people living in the west but for us in the subcontinent it is it pretty much our holocaust but on much bigger scale one of my elders who have been victim of the partition literally was on tears when he saw the history being rewritten and presented in the wrong way imagine someone belonging to family of 15 only to be reduced to 1 because of this tragedy and then the story of it being presented differently it heart wrenching on top of that it felt like marvel have actually shot some of the scenes in mumbai india instead of karachi pakistan that the biggest disrespectful thing they ve done it really felt downright ugly and m even more worried how the fifth episode is going to present the partition and if they do it wrong there would be around 2 billion people demanding apologies even the governments might jump in the bandwagon in that case it would be the end of ms marvel for good hoping against hope that they wouldn follow someone personal agenda and try to distort fact as fiction ', ' its so good from all sides this has intense actions best cast best intro best character without overpowered things which hate in wanda liked how they investigate and how mat help the law by fighting enemies and how he get people in jail without killing them and liked his friendship so much with nelson and karen page how defense people together the series showed frank castle aka the punisher which one of my best characters and he helped mat late in s2 which one of my best scenes in the series over all the series is so good and who wants to fight me let fight ', ' really liked the retrospect and the effects were great as superhero captain marvel was rather modest but also interesting there was no mcu movie with woman in the main role however brie larson did well in her role in the movie there were also funny elements where could laughed well but that was not so often jackson tried to show his funny side of fury and think he did it well he was very different than in the films before he and gregg both have been able to give their younger selves character which have deep impact on the chronologically later films series the end of the film found rather unspectacular as far as fury and an important animal are concerned have more the rogue were different than had hoped and therefore disappointed me captain marvel costume is well done and the colors look good on her the music was perfect as there are both exciting film music and pop rock music from the 90s which again underlines the time back then 1995 and makes you feel more into the time actually in the fight scenes fits this music super pure the film is perfect for anyone who loves sci fi action and marvel films larson symbolizes strong woman which is why the film has positive impact on many people in my opinion theoretically you can watch the film without any prior knowledge on the previous ones watching movies apart from the post credit scene give the film 7 out of 10 points he was good but not really special but definitely worth seeing cgi 8 5 10 music 10 10 heroes 9 5 10 supporting roles 7 5 10 costumes 9 5 10 genre 10 10 dialogues 7 10 storyline bit confusing but 6 10 villians 7 5 10 conclusion worth seeing marvel comic film with varied plot with good origin story is both exciting and funny stan lee who recently passed away has cameo appearance in the movie as in any mcu movie so far ', ' bad screenplay bad script bad acting and bad music scary bad the only mildly entertaining parts are are the special effects that even though impressive take away the only thing this movie desperately needs reality and not just green screens this could have been something for the masses but this seems more directed to the youngest audience at least when it comes to the painful and effortless performances of the actors budget almost comparable to what peter jackson had for three lord of the rings movies it makes me sick to see money be wasted on something like this star wars episode ii and iii comes to mind want my two hours back please ', ' it feels bit slow for some parts of the movie but there were moments that made up for it definitely worth watch at least once ', ' as comic books fan must say he daredevil one of the most complex characters loved it the characters story line fight sequences scores production cinematography direction music everything was great can wait to see the next season season 1 8 8 season 2 9 5 season 3 9 3 thank you marvel thank you netflix simply perfect show ', ' captain marvel is another solid addition to the marvel cinematic universe series of movies while don think it a top tier film like the avengers black panther or captain america civil war or even second tier set of films like doctor strange the thor series or ant man it is really entertaining and fun with lot of world building the film tells really good story of empowerment self discovery and not taking things on face value because there is always more than meets the eyes the script is filled with great character moments especially developing nick fury and making captain marvel total bad there a lot of funny lines and snarky remarks that are true to the marvel formula my main issue is with how the film handles its plots they pack lot in to making the film fit within the mcu that it tends to rush through lot of interesting storylines that the film sets up and we get some hollow victories the stakes also don feel completely all there because we know the outcome of most of the characters on the flip side we do get lot of great character moments speaking of the characters this movie has tone of great ones sam jackson as nick fury is great as ever and we get more softer moments with him he always been harden soldier and it great seeing him early in his career when he was bit more naive brie larson as captain marvel is true standout and great addition to the plethora of great marvel characters she has some of the best parts of every characters that make up the mcu she has iron man snark cap leadership thor confidence hulk strength and widow resourcefulness so she is great culmination of the heroes we love while being her own ben mendelsohn and jude law are both great as powerful threats and allies again captain marvel isn a groundbreaking film in the mcu but it is film with lot of entertainment fun and world building it has characters that are great additions to the mcu and the film does great job of building up towards avengers endgame it is worth the watch give it 3 5 5 ', ' would not change thing and could not ask for more thanks to all who created this show ', ' started with some great action found the story line average guess was expecting lot from this movie everyone is looking old now need to get new blood in and getting family drama in action movie nah ', ' not good show first 2 3 episode were nice and rest of them ar very very baaad the miss marvel character is very cute and girl playing it so cute but it is not the only thing watch series for ', ' the punisher as concept is not really my cup of tea so started watching this series quite while after the season 2 came out just because didn have anything else to watch and boy oh boy got hooked after just one episode it an action filled series that doesn just tell the story of the punisher but focuses on other people around him too adding quite few different points of view in the story for me there is not one protagonist in this series but many and clear message of the damage war and greed can cause what so amazing about this series is not just the plot and the direction though but the unbelievable performance of the actors in it with jon bernthal at the top owning his role so many great talents in this series just well done highly recommended ', ' this is decent show period idk what some people expected to say this show is so bad it about teenage girl lol if you don get that marvel was trying to make lighter more fun show with this then you are just dense and that why you didn like it also nothing is worse than moonknight that is the worst so if you want just fun interesting story about different kind of hero this is something you ll like if your looking for golden glove action drama just keeps scrolling and find something else it is what it is ', ' season 3 the editing was average the fight stunt were horrible in the first 4 episodes the american hindi speaking actors can speak hindi the screenplay isn tight enough very elastic and could have cut short by 4 episodes the first 3 episodes were bore on overall at episode 9 it is clear that hell kitchen is on the likes of being gotham but daredevil isn a batman finally this felt like batman joker saga as far as the drama is concerned this is marvel best tv show all seasons ', ' first of all like marvel as it is but this is the first story that happend with people all comments are so negative but this twist love it think because this story is about muslims and good muslim people thats why it is not so successful can watch this with my kids one is spiderman fan and one is iron man fan but they were so happy watching this that can not understand the negativity it has been the cultural side of us immigrants in the western countries it reflects it that our boys and our girls are trying there best to keep up with the western society and thats why this serie deserve so much more ', ' if you are looking for story plot with logic and mature writing this first episode ain for you tries too hard but feels artificial let see if future episodes are any good ', ' will try to keep this very simple if you are an avid tv series watcher this tv show will most likely entertain you but not satisfy you jessica jones is not bad tv show by any means it has everything it needs to be entertaining but marvel is trying way to hard with this show to close the gap between the shallow entertaining mcu movies and the more demanding deep meaning tv show crowd in the past few years the entertainment industry learned that with deeper more meaningful content people can be baited into watching tv as shown with mad men breaking bad game of thrones etc and there is lot of money to earn with this kind of demographic and this show tries to pitch in on that demogrpahic without actually accommodating the demographic it barely scratches the surface of what could be and sadly relies on what already is right from the get go it doesn take longer than episode 4 to make the entire series rely on the mcu marvel cinematic universe to please the crowd referencing the hulk and thor directly which is just sad as if the whole genre couldn exist without the success of the avangers movies once again jessica jones is not bad tv show by any means feel like have to emphasize on that but it not nearly as good as it could have been if it wouldn rely on the mcu that much the cast is well chosen especially kryten ritter as jessica jones seems like an obvious choice and david tennant as the antagonist is almost like match up made in heaven there is so much potential in this cast alone that the generic plots and average scripts based on todays quality of tv shows just makes you think of what could have been and what actually is in the end it all boils down to marvel being more than confident that whatever they throw towards their demographic they will eat up happily without any complaints but compared to actual original tv shows jessica jones is just what the majority of the mcu movies are people pleaser without any real depth that by itself is not bad thing by any means there are lot of tv shows out there who could wish to be on the level of quality of jessica jones but that doesn change that jessica jones is missing out on lot of potential if you wish to be entertained give this tv show shot it is on the level of tv shows like king of queens or the early tbbt and taahm seasons but aside from that it doesn have much to offer just be aware of that and you should be fine this won be another breaking bad or anything like that as long as you are aware of that you shouldn be disappointed ', ' this show could have been great opportunity to introduce or re introduce the inhumans to mcu but instead we got some silly uninspired plot about djinns and magic bracelets the heavy religion themed propaganda disguised as cultural diversity does not do the show any favors either ', ' to go from moon knight which was very self contained for an mcu entry to ms marvel which practically vomits mcu all over us from the word go was an interesting change of pace as male in his mid 30s ve been on the mcu train since iron man in 2008 and ve been beginning to wonder when d be left behind while the mouse house attempts to get its claws well and truly into the teens of today the ms marvel trailer had me thinking that time had finally come this just wasn for me and maybe was finally starting to outgrow the mcu not today ms marvel pilot episode was refreshingly fun iman vellani has been expertly cast by marvel studios as uber fan kamala kahn hers is the peter parker origin story that the mcu denied us with tom holland spidey vellani herself is self confessed mcu nerd which just ingratiates her to me even more her charm and enthusiasm for the role shines through brilliantly especially liked the art style used for some of the visual storytelling throughout the pilot evoking memories of scott pilgrim vs the world and spider man into the spider verse overall the latest entry for marvel on disney plus is off to strong start much to my surprise here hoping the show can keep the momentum going through its 6 episode run ', ' the movie engages the viewer from very strong opening sequence through the two bonus scenes included in the closing credits the nearly two and half hour running time passes by swiftly and leaves you eagerly awaiting follow up sequel while whedon smartly recognizes how key downey jr stark is to the story he also allows most all of his cast heroes and villain ample opportunities to shine both in dialogue and action solid entertainment and much better than d expected from the maestro of midcult joss whedon visit http bollywood updates net ', ' most negative reviews about vulgarity etc are most likely coming from the interracial coupling on the show however my grievance is one of acting set design dialogue and pacing of the script nothing works strong female characters can be believable if done right such as beatrice kiddo in kill bill krysten ritter is simply not good enough actor to carry the show her delivery seems like she just read the lines from script and has something more interesting scheduled in her personal life after the shoot also dialogue such as the gem our marriage is over we don even do oral makes you think how far removed the writers are from real life this is no daredevil and does not deserve its placement in the same universe just watched few episodes and couldn force myself anymore missed opportunity ', ' had high expectations for agents of h e d judging by the success of marvel movies such as men thor and iron man and mistakenly thinking this tv show would be reminiscent of its dc rival arrow was eager to tune in this show is lacking on so many levels interesting plots lines intriguing characters that thing that draws you so deeply into show you think you feel like you are there most importantly though this program is lacking on the one think that the agents of shields existence rests upon superheroes agents of shield can learn lot from arrow in fact to even compare the two is quite offensive ', ' the show where every important character can survive anything and be on their feet in seconds like the story and the characters and the drama between them but am so tired of these ridiculous action scenes the important characters are basically super humans than can brush of every injury they get while the not so important die like flies when will we get intelligent action scenes again without these stupid plot armors ', ' they copied everything which is indian and present it as pakistani culture mehndi songs and the way we celebrate wedding and dress and think its pakistani why they dont include lollywood culture into this and celebrate it why they themselves are ashamed of their actors and the customs ', ' entertaining show clearly geared towards younger audience but still enjoyable for adults just don expect an action packed or serious story when watching this it a fun and mostly light hearted origin story of teenage superhero character is different from the comics but seeing how they have to work around certain copyright restrictions that was to be expected all in all found it more enjoyable show to watch compared to the more recent marvel series ', ' special effects are especially bad too childish for the mcu would like to see them go in different direction this feels like disney channel throwback show ', ' it was action packed and kept me hooked all the way through and the cast were so good scarlett johansson is always good but was so impressed with florence pugh she was brilliant it nice to see david harbour and also great to see the beautiful rachel weisz m little bit baffled by the low score as in my opinion it better than many of the other marvel films ', ' ve liked brie larson in other films but she showed zero range in this when your main character in superhero movie is unwatchable you already have problem in addition captain marvel has no weaknesses which kills the tension immediately there is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing or any danger at all for that matter it an ok origin story but it makes no sense as to why she supposedly so powerful the cat was good ', ' have only finished watching the first season of the daredevil netflix original series but enjoyed it so much that immediately wanted to write up review so forget all your worries and listen to me sit back and relax this is spoiler free firstly although have not read single daredevil comic and therefore cannot consider myself die hard fan was still vaguely aware of the character and the universe he inhabited before going into this series also like many of you was extremely disappointed with 2003 feature film in which daredevil received his big screen debut therefore was hopeful that the netflix series would finally do the character justice thankfully upon hearing good reviews for the series became quite excited to see the series for myself however house of cards swept me off my feet first eventually decided to take break from that series and take look at daredevil to see if it was as good as others said fortunately was not disappointed this series contains everything that hoped it would tremendous action engaging narratives relatable characters and believable performances shall begin by divulging further into the characters as feel that they help make the show all the actors do fantastic job of bringing beloved comic book characters to the small screen charlie cox portrays believable daredevil and his clear chemistry with co star elden henson who plays foggy nelson makes for far better nelson and murdock pairing than affleck and favreau am convinced that these two are best friends and want to see things go their way also really loved deborah ann woll as karen page and vondie curtis hall as ben urich both actors portray their characters as strong and fierce individuals who are willing to fight for what right am glad to see that karen wasn reduced to damsel in distress role however the performance that really stood out to me was vincent onofrio portrayal of the kingpin the man has proved that he can play captivating villain but his performance drastically differs this time around onofrio gives the kingpin very human qualities to the point where we begin to sympathise with him this is what makes the kingpin so captivating and complex when you stop to think about it he isn wrong however he goes about creating his vision in the wrong way and this means he has to be stopped despite all the great performances from the leads they never take the spotlight away from the supporting cast many minor characters show up and disappear as quickly as they arrived but they all leave an impression on the audience and that is something to be admired furthermore the story telling in daredevil is also top notch in my opinion it provides realistic depiction of what it would like if someone decided to put on mask and fight crime in each episode we see matt struggle with his inner demons as he tries to continue to do the right thing and calm his mind we see him struggle as he hides this secret from the ones he loves and desperately attempts to balance his normal life with the life of vigilante was thoroughly hooked by the narrative of every episode every time jumped back into the world of daredevil the series quickly grabbed my attention and didn let go until the credits rolled one thing loved in particular about the new daredevil series is that although the series contains brilliantly choreographed and intensely thrilling action it doesn rely on this you will see lot more of matt murdock than you will daredevil but the scenes with murdock never get boring am always interested to see what happens next in his personal journey as result viewers are rewarded for their patience and loyalty because when daredevil does show up there is massive pay off all the action seen in daredevil would fit well into feature film and the fact that we get this on the small screen is certainly something to behold in fact this series contains one of my favourite actions scenes on television which reminded me of certain scene from oldboy which won spoil here but those you who have seen both daredevil and oldboy will know what mean overall daredevil is fantastic series never thought that superhero show would keep me hooked for as long as this one has given my current distaste for the over abundance of superhero films that bombard our cinemas nowadays thoroughly enjoyed every second of the series due to its story telling character development performances and action not to mention that it one of the best looking television shows out there today it hard to find fault with the show but of course it isn perfect however it is quickly becoming one of my favourite shows alongside house of cards and breaking bad am glad that have netflix account and if you haven seen the show yet what are you waiting for ', ' this review pains me to write because genuinely think that season 1 was the pinnacle of serialized television it had amazing plotting satisfying ending terrifying villain characters that loved nothing superfluous beautiful cinematography and tone it delivered on every promise that it made could not wait for season 2 and those two years were tough alas it finally arrived knew going in that it had tough act to follow and so made concerted effort to judge it on it own merits and not to dismiss it just for failing to achieve the impossible by living up to the first what went wrong plotting all over the place with little focus terrifying villain try no villain characters that love yes but the two leads are mostly kept separate from each other for some strange reason nothing superfluous carrie ann moss and her entire sub plot was boring and irrelevant jessica rival pi was flat plot device satisfying ending wouldn know couldn get past episode 8 it was putting me to sleep the season did continue to have beautiful cinematography and tone atmosphere but that gets no points from me if the writing is dull nutmeg can make good egg nog great but it not appetizing when eaten on it own think the biggest problem with season 2 is that it fails to deliver on jessica jones core promise it is sci fi super hero show about tortured loner who does not want to be superhero but is none the less forced to fight super villains because they are threatening her and the people she loves in other words season 2 was jurassic park without dinosaurs m giving the show 5 perfect 10 for the first season and 0 for the second ', ' very boring to slow and then the action scene to fast disappointed ', ' used to trust imdb scores but if this movie achieved to get score above 8 stars than it is just reasonable conclusion for me to move on without sounding mean avengers has nothing not one single original idea the script was probably written by bunch of marketing professionals and mindless script writing machine if you find pleasure in having your daily coffee in the mccafe if you like to buy things on the tv shopping channel if hanging out in shopping mall is the ultimate sunday plan for you than go for this movie you will not be disappointed ', ' expected lot from this show episode 1 was kinda ok but the second one was just plain bad it just kept dragging on and on they were trying way to hard to keep it interesting and nothing was exactly happening in the show will give it one more episode and hopefully they recover ', ' truly one of the worst films have ever seen utterly slow with many unnecessary scenes save yourself the time trouble and cash do not see this movie ', ' as someone who has not read marvel comics has not seen the films captain america the hulk thor or iron man ii this film failed to pull me in as standalone movie the avengers feels like mishmash of rapid surface level character introduction and way too much action little attention is given to character development as it seems viewers are expected to come into the film with degree of knowledge however this is not to say that think the film would be great if did have some knowledge of the backstory there little in the way of moral here or deeper meaning as this is just good guy saves world plot it one that like many superhero movies before makes me ask if character development or thought for that matter really are being extinguished by money driven action wouldn even call this popcorn movie as found few laughs and absolutely no connection to the characters in my experience like action movies but need to be drawn in to the characters in order to care about the action the avengers didn even try to draw me in it just said here are the heroes now watch them fight if the first hour had established some human element for the heroes might have liked the action as it stands the audience is thrown into the arena with the invincible combatants and expected to immediately feel for them despite their inherent invincibility must ask why should care about action when one side can lose and haven been told otherwise why should root for the yankees the only reason can see is because the bad guy loki wears ridiculous looking costume keep attempting to find redemption in society reception of this movie maybe that why hope that m just missing big part of the backstory m big whedon fan and came into the avengers hoping to see some more of his magic was rewarded with two and half hour snooze fest of cg action my only sincere hope is that the millions he makes off of this movie funds real projects of his in the future ', ' just sat thru 14 or 15 hr superhero marathon ending with the avengers at around 12 midnight it made all the previous superhero movies that came before it feel like small tease snack leading up to the epic meal time main coarse all can say is wow the way they actually gave almost equal screen time to the characters and yet your favorite which ever one it is feels like they got the perfect amoount of screen time to compliment the movie perfect balance and mean perfect the length was also perfect stay after the credits priceless cant say enough about this movie id say this was better than than any superhero movie before it including the dark knight this actually has the potential of dethroning avatar as the top box office this was epic ', ' not really necessary it did connect the two movies together iron man and the incredible hulk and explained why stark was chosen to go to the general which was nice to have that connection but it didn add to anything and the information wasn really needed it was extra short as well which didn help the music took away from it making it feel cheesy and not very serious it always nice to see agent coulson in action but felt they could have added lot more to this to make it more of story even some filler scenes would have helped it just felt cheep and out of place it needed more ', ' yes those exist the soundtrack of this film couldn have been more generic it depressing to the ears the jokes are corny and are only mildly funny at the theater with other folks upon the first viewing it try hard comedy the film itself is joke and massive disappointment these are awesome heroes the film should have been more awesome it could have it could have had great writing less alien cgi and more care for its characters it simply boring but hey if you like action if you like generic if you like cgi if you laugh at anything if you love these comic book heroes so much you ll make yourself believe this is good movie just so you can be happy then great for you all power to you but this is as average as average cinema gets and stand by that ', ' honestly after iron fist was beginning to lose faith in marvel contributions to tv however just finished the punisher all 13 episodes in 5 days my faith has been restored bravo marvel bravo new standard has been set in the genre and it is high have no idea where the naysayers are finding fault in this well cast well scripted well woven plot 10 10 will look forward to season 2 ', ' rarely we get perfect casting for comic book characters and most renowned ones are the ones who wear down on us through time however this series introduced characters who were perfectly cast charlie cox as murdock vincent deonofrio as fisk john bernthal as castle elodie yung as elektra wilson bethel as poindexter are few of the exceptionally amazing casting fits like glove is the term right but the side characters are so good really didn enjoy debroh ann woll character development season 3 gave us special insight into her character which was amazing elden hensen character was less used compared to ann woll but it was very well done too the story is very well done the suit used by matt during the start and the end of the series shows diy suit basically black sweatshirt and pants and scarf on his head which really grounded his character eventhough he has this crazy powers which also were very well done same goes for the villains none of them have any over the top powers and everything feels very real and very close like it could actually be happening in some part of the world the world building is pretty good and isn just background but quite interactive side characters which are introduced were amazing namely rahul nadeem father lantom etc somehow they bring forth the soul of the story the sound design is very well not too excessive and over the top it will hype you up when needed tense you up make you feel sad but all the while never overtake the scene and that amazing cinematography was on point there wasn any shaky cameras used or if done where very skillfully handled it wil give you the vibe of the nolan batman fighting in the alleys that street fight kinda vibe everything is to love about the series docked some point cause the season 2 was bit if mess and didn quite mix well and there were few decisions made by some characters which don really make lot of sense but this is highly recommended show and ask of you to give it your time you won regret it thanks for reading see you later ', ' great cast very nice visuals breezy tone for the majority cool action scenes very lean story with lots of pace and sequence in the middle that was so bananas it had me laughing out loud the bad guy whilst having very strong motivation was little one note m not sure it completely nailed the landing with some squiffy logic at the conclusion and personally would have enjoyed bit more carol danvers character stuff but overall this was thoroughly enjoyable entry into the mcu even though they didn include the mcu fanfare music at the beginning which is always crime ', ' remember when marvel took their time and made good content all these series are just watered down rushed garbage disney has great library of content there is no need to pepper it with all these cheap projects take couple of years and build the next phase properly with well developed characters this is pure volume over quality ', ' don know what to say or where to start everything about this show is below mediocre the casting the acting the costume the dialogues the cgi everything is bad it doesn seem like an mcu show don know how this project script got approved its more like an indian soap opera ', ' it my first review here the reason why don review movies here is simple it because english is not my first language but found the avengers score to be so ridiculous that decided to make my first review the avengers is not the first overrated or underrated movie here but usually such overreaction about movie last for 2 weeks or 1 month after the fans saw and reviewed it the score adjust itself when the people not sold to the movie start to see it but in the case of the avengers it seems that there so much people who gave the avengers not deserved 10 that to this day even after the disc release the score is still way too high 8 4 more than scarface and only 0 2 point away from apocalyspe now you got to be kidding me right but enough with my imdb criticism here my review of the movie personally try to review movie with an open mind and rate movie for what it is and what it tries to be if movie features some of the best special effects or action sequences ever m gonna consider it in my review but what actually makes good movie directing acting casting special effects soundtrack costume script editing makeup cinematography soul personally don think great movie needs to masterize all those few movies actually did shawshank redemption was really close but think great movie needs to be at the very least top in at the minimum 2 or 3 categories so let see for the avengers let start with the script honestly it one of the worst script ve seen on the last 10 years it makes tron legacy script looks like chef oeuvre the directing this is where the avengers shine little bit and it the only place it does it a miracle joss was able to make something good out of this awful script the acting was not bad but it was uneven tom hiddleston did good job as lokki fassbender would have been better downey was good as usual but sorta under the autopilot ruffalo was okay but did not play big role renner and johansson did the best they could with uninteresting characters but they were certainly not able to outdo themselves to make those characters interesting evans was awful as usual can stand this guy hemsworth was not really credible as semi god but can really blame him when semi god gets owned by modern day mr hyde overall the acting was galaxies away from fifth element have lot of respect for most of the actors in the avengers who is to blame for the not exceptional acting the script the directing the casting lack of interest in the project by the actors maybe little bit of all of those now let get to the name of the game which is the action sequences and the special effects and this is where disagree with people giving this moving more than 7 while the special effects were technically great those were very far from being in the top league tron legacy had far more interesting special effects and tron legacy did not succeed avatar was leagues over the avengers avatar is major league the avengers is farm club inception too even if did not like it as much as wanted to the avengers special effects don have soul they are artistically nothing to write home about already forgot them when got out of the theater after seeing avatar 3d felt like when was young and saw terminator 2 for this first time felt something had not felt in years was impressed by the special effects alone everything else was not important the avengers special effects are meh it like 10 years old kid designed them and they spent millions over millions to make them technically look good now let get to the action sequences hero is league over that the firth element is league over that terminator 2 is league over that the matrix is god creation when it comes to action sequences if you compare it to the avengers now m not saying the special effects and action sequences were bad cause they were good what m saying is it not worthy of 8 9 or 10 and not even close to it when you consider the script and uneven acting the special effects and actions sequences were certainly not good enough to make this movie great there hundred and probably even thousand of movies with better special effects and action sequences when you compare them to the movies released at the same time now when started this review intended to give the avengers 1 star but doing so would make me as bad as the people who gave this movie 10 so decided to give it the score it deserves which is imo 6 9 now personally think that imdb should think about the way it calculates the weighted average 10 and 1 rating weight way too much let be honest for second we have enough fingers to count the number of movies worthy of 10 or 1 m astonished to see that close to 40 of the people gave the avengers 10 really don see how someone could think this movie is perfect even fan of marvel the script alone is enough reason to reduce the score don mind short movies with no script when they embrace it but sadly the avengers was close to 2 hours and half and actually tried to tell story and this is where imo the movie actually failed ', ' was expecting to see the greatest hero movie ever made but it had nothing new and actually had less than other much less hyped movies they spent waay too much time and money advertising the movie should have given more of that to the writers let them polish the script hollywood producers are forgetting that good movie starts in the script not in interviews not in special effects not in the hype judging by how much money this movie will make though bet next time they will give even more of the writers share to the market team ', ' like this show don get me wrong but personally don like it for me the character development is bit poor the story is great the scenes are great the lighting and the texture are great also but just not feeling it living up to its potential it could be way better for me there is not enough action taken place the characters have you to much to spare by talking about nonsense am just not fan of this show as much as d like to be this show has its adversary of net letting the characters dwell into place there all mixed up with acts that they re not portraying it to be good job maybe next marvel will choose better character to build on ', ' love you scarjo the black widow this is good sendoff to oblivion you deserved better but also you re goat ', ' just can understand why the critics gave this film anything jude law and his gang are the only good thing about it and you think they would find star who could run brie larson looks like she had to go to athletic school for crash course but didn make it past the first jog ', ' it not bad or annoying movie it looks all pretty and expensive but comes off as plain and flat in the end was left bored ', ' am shocked by how many good reviews this show got lol like literally shocked it not that think the show is hot garbage but it average at best okay will admit that there were some good aspects of the show the directing was fantastic and loved the gritty darker feel of it writing was mostly okay not great just average and some of the acting was okay my biggest annoyance the star of the show the main character she is so annoying like get them wanting to portray tough lady who suffered lot of trauma but instead they delivered someone who is flat out obnoxious like super obnoxious the writers and the directors tried too hard to make her this tough and troubled woman to the point where could not sympathize with her character at all by episode 4 was so annoyed with jessica jones that gave up on the show ', ' no idea why anyone would consider this decent show let alone good to great one the story is so slow it lacks the development and intrigue that daredevil has and fraction of the action to make up the difference it should have been 4 episode story arc but 13 episodes is brutal it juvenile in it plot and arc the screenwriter worked on the oc and twilight and it shows it like teenager wrote script while trying to pretend they were an adult like this is what it would be like if adults talked it supposed to be private eye noir theme thriller but it not it lacks that type of engagement the characters development is terrible main character you care nothing for mean nothing this is clear in how little you care that she an alcoholic you want her to suffer in the show she so miserable and treats people terrible she isn empowering she pathetic she aggravating kilgrave is the highlight and he barely in it through the early part of the show at least the characters with mild sympathy like luke cage or trish walker aren strong enough to help spoilers the writing using swear words doesn make it good writing having sex scenes doesn make it good writing creating girls with attitude doesn make it good writing writing lesbians into the plot doesn make it good writing introducing abortion doesn make it edgy it stilted corny unimaginative it doesn unpack the way other stories do that are far better skip this one and watch dd instead ', ' have all the marvel films have seen none of the tv series as don have any paid streaming services understand may have gaps in my knowledge because of that had seen the bad reviews but thought lot of them were probably based in misogyny read up on the content of wandavision and ms marvel so would understand the events had missed by not giving disney money don have over the first hour was quite engaged and was able to follow the storyline relate to the characters and realise there was certain tongue in cheek quality to it not unusual in the mcu the music was bit annoying but no problem then it turned into musical quite ridiculously and for no good or logical reason why someone didn just say to the director this is crazy please don i don understand but that was it for me lost interest it broke the engagement had and just assumed that this was the next step in the mcu and it wasn for me if you re going to do an mcu for kids at least make it clear that what you re doing anyone want cheap blu ray ', ' was absolutely hooked from beginning to end amazing storyline great acting finished the show in about week not show to watch with young kids it one of the most violent shows ve ever seen regardless loved it and wish to see it continue great show ', ' this film feels forced doesn need to exist still found it enjoyable better than some other marvel entries black widow has no powers all of the sudden in this film she seems stronger than captain america surviving extreme car crashes and fallen from high altitude she does not receive one scratch taskmaster was total fail one of the worst mcu villains ', ' the fil is overfilled with vfx and the action scenes seem so unnecessary and the story has no originality but it can be good watch if you watch it in 3d you wont get bored atleast ', ' this surely can be aimed at adults rather poor movie with so many lazy plots and cliche after another ', ' following up 3 disney shows and at least 1 film the marvels feels more like the experimental team up films of phase 2 rather than the cookie cutter disconnected nature of phase 5 brie larson iman vellani and teyonah parris create wonderfully charming team as you can truly feel the friendship growing throughout the film while brie larson is always captivating iman vellani steals the show every moment she is on screen her performance as kamala khan is consistently charismatic comedically well timed and delightfully quotable unfortunately the villainous dar benn zawe ashton was underutilized and the short runtime felt like it should ve stretched to give her more character building the supporting cast all compliment the story well with nick fury sam jackson and the khan family having fun with their side plot while the film is full of exciting moments wish they had fully committed to the wacky elements as this feels similar to ragnarok but it stayed too tame to really blow you away for the most part the visual effects look appealing and it isn until the mid credits scene that things start to look rushed and rubbery though would have loved to see them play more with the interesting additions brought into the mcu the marvels is very charming and captivating ride akin to films like ragnarok or guardians ', ' it fun it light hearted acting is above par and it a good story watched the first 4 episodes and eagerly anticipating the rest oh and disney is doing just fine don listen to those kind of people ', ' you don require brain power for this there not much of story or plot just bunch of kids trying to be witty so m definitely not the target audience but would ve been nice if it was atleast entertaining probably weaker than most of the very poor recent marvel series hope the take lessons from something like the daredevil series and stop messing their franchise up that took decade to build ', ' immediately after watching the avengers was confused all of my friends seemed to love it the theater roared its approval as the credits rolled and most of the reviews ve read are overwhelmingly positive for these reasons m not entirely sure watched the same movie as everybody else but m perfectly willing to comment on what saw the film opens with loki stealing the tesseract an all powerful energy device that poses significant threat to earth security thankfully nick fury assembles the avengers the group of superheroes who are the focus of the film robert downey jr chris hemsworth chris evans and mark ruffalo all reprise their roles of iron man thor captain america and the incredible hulk while scarlet johansson and jeremy renner portray the black widow and hawkeye every single one of these characters loki included is entirely one dimensional and frankly boring to watch with the possible exception of the hulk they are straight forward flawless superheroes who have absolutely no trouble dispatching anyone who crosses them this makes the prolonged action sequences particularly difficult to watch you never doubt who is going to prevail as for the central story of the film it is complete mess it an action movie in the truest sense of the word every aspect of the plot is twisted to encourage more fighting sequences which really prevents the film from moving forward at all the story doesn provoke further thought in any way and really just serves to provide mindless action and downright terrible dialogue in particular downey jr relentlessly delivers sarcastic insults every few minutes which just aren that funny in my opinion once or twice found it amusing but by the end of the movie was sick of it the other characters aren much better with the exception of thor who had few funny moments despite everything have said there no criticizing how the film looks the cgi sequences are stunning and the various locations in the film are visually pleasing it doesn break any new ground but it still entertaining overall this is not good movie the characters are flat static uninteresting people portrayed by uninspired actors the story is atrocious and riddled with holes the action sequences are painfully long and predictable and perhaps worst of all when it was trying so hard to be funny it simply wasn looking at all the names that contributed to this movie am frankly shocked at the finished product joss whedon is brilliant director and writer loved firefly and most of the actors particularly downey jr renner and ruffalo are usually enjoyable so m not quite sure where everything went wrong but hopefully they can produce more thoughtful sequel with their next efforts rating 4 10 ', ' kudos to marvel for representation maybe the show is targeted to younger audience but why is that problem the artwork and animated sequences including work from shehzil malik was excellent the walk through the market place with old and familiar songs the mix of the music we listen to from eva to blinding lights by the weeknd have high hopes again this is just the first episode looking forward to what comes next heck there even some fan art on instagram sketchbooksquared ', ' if you start the show then trust me you can stop before watching the whole season ', ' this show is unlike any other superhero series ve ever seen the fight scenes are amazing and extremely realistic the characters have believable motives and very good character development the plot and revelations are also very interesting it amazing couldn reccomend it more ', ' while yes of course it could have been better and yes it wasn as good as something like endgame this movie had the action to keep you entertained and it definitely had an interesting story with it this movie was also operating in small gap between civil war and infinity war it didn have lot of room to work found it entertaining and enjoyable while there were flaws m not going to waste my time trying to pick apart this movie if your thinking of movie to watch d suggest this ', ' honestly felt like this show was made for 10 year olds it felt like an insult to my viewing intelligence as was watching got no problem with the fact that she muslim but the overall tone was that of kid show oh and realize that she young but you should probably have superhero characters be in some level of good shape for the role it adds authenticity to the role ', ' iron man thor hulk black widow and etc are the main characters and disney marvel has milked them for 20 movies in the mcu then they started making movies for the secondary characters like doctor strange and those movies are sub par now they are making shows for moon knight and characters like this idiot ms marvel enough is enough not ever superhero needs tv show and movie series ', ' to be totally honest had tried watching daredevil in 2015 and found the first episode boring then stopped watching in fact also saw the premiere of jessica jones and luke cage but didn like them later this year watched the premiere of iron fist and kind of liked but noticed it had poor ratings as compared to the other netflix marvel shows it didn make any sense so decided rewatch them in their respective order and found out that only their pilot sucked not because they lacked story but because their pilots were building up the real story but at slow pace right now all can say is daredevil is my best marvel netflix tv series to date followed by jessica jones then luke cage like them all and am glad watched them and one thing for sure is that if you watch the three iron fist and the arrowverse dc comics will seem to have immature story plots no offence daredevil gets 9 5 10 from me one more thing hope this hand thing is over the story was absolutely boring especially in the defenders but for the villains they are really fascinating and for those who found themselves in my situation please ignore the first two episodes they are simply slow paced and after you reach the third or fourth episode you ll clearly get whats going on ', ' stop forcing characters to fit story and start making the story fit the characters ', ' unfortunately bri larson personality isn as colorful as her costume ', ' we never quite expect good for reunion movies this time well marvel did everything okay and assemble their avengers team in surprising way loki steals the cosmic cube and abducts 2 characters including hawkeye nick fury from h e d must assemble his most trusted members even if at first there might be ego frictions thor joins in later in the movie especially that he is after loki the final battle takes place in the middle of manhattan in this movie loki tony stark and the hulk steals the show black widow is not bad either on martial arts battle the hawkeye character could use movie of his own especially would be good to share the bill with the widow herself and stan lee has his moment would not be bad to see an avengers 2 but let see the other sequels first ', ' amazing jon bernthal is definetily the punisher what an amazing role brutally and intense great show ', ' have no idea why it has so much bad reviews love it maybe it just because like kamala khan and ve read ms marvel comics before but that tv show was really good ', ' first of all don like the changes in khan power and also don like the too much promotion of woke culture and also don like the family scenes too much this series is not completely comic accurate that is another reason why also don like it the falcon and the winter soldier was also the worst marvel series too much use of the multiverse also ruined this series ', ' if you don like teenage drama with no sense of plot direction then don bother poorly written script and feels like very low budget serial it like watching never have ever only with super power references ', ' everything they say is true black widow is so boring and 45 minutes too long florence pugh was the only good part ', ' terrible movie from start to finish the actors are wooden the action is basically just hand to hand combat with limited relevance to their super powers captain america looks like he is embarrassed to be part of it the hulk can control his fury then he can then he can then he can and so on there is no real explanation of the relationship between thor and his brother nor is there any real tension in the end was left not caring whether the good guys won or lost oh and iron man who is usually quite fun and funny was total bore with his inane one liners only mark ruffalo as the professor was any good he always seems to shine in any movie ', ' amazing movie scarlett did amazing job as black widow over decade and this movies shows us how family have your back now matter what good movie with lot of comedies ', ' this movie was excellent saw it in 4d movie theater which was awesome in its own right really don know what these people who are giving this movie low rating want it is marvel movie not contender for the oscar movie of the year category this movie delivered what it was supposed to action and laughs the dynamics of there enter connected relationships was fun to watch bit shallow but again it marval movie people feel like most of these people went to hate watch you know what they say you only find what your looking for so if your looking for it to suck your going to find reason that it does ', ' if it weren for florence pugh and david the movie would have been much duller they definitely carries it ', ' m not fan of serials whether it be comics radio programs or films many of them such as this one adventures of captain marvel are largely engineered to appeal to young boys which is why great proportion of them are western shoot em ups pulpy detective mysteries and exotic adventure yarns or otherwise based on comic strips and books about male heroes with the damsels in distress they must rescue as they combat dastardly villains with their clandestine criminal organizations generally with cliffhanger to end each episode some chapter play aficionados however claim this one in particular to be one of the best of the bunch indeed although it is much of the same from chapter to chapter and from serial to serial there is an interesting aspect to this one involving its particular adventure and hero this one starts out with some standard derivative orientalism the white colonialist archaeologists trespassing in an ancient tomb in some exotic eastern land and the superstitious natives defending said tomb in centuries long tradition and who are ready at volcano eruption notice to start slaying the infidels whether egypt or siam the location doesn seem to matter to the filmmakers case in point this instance seems to mostly be lifting from the universal mummy series including the 1932 original but more so the 1940s kharis entries from those films this one adopts among other things the business with scroll this is the first part of that interesting aspect in this one where series of different media are self referentially included the superhero captain marvel began in the comic books picture stories like hieroglyphs or other logographs drawn and written the scroll in particular provides instructions for the scorpion artifact device that is rather analogous to cinema in its system of lenses that transmutes real world objects and people into something else the scroll like the comics to the film proper serves as sort of script to the scorpion camera like apparatus within the film in the following episodes the third popular media for serials the radio repeatedly becomes an important plot device the first instance involves billy batson telling the story of the first episode for his radio program m fan of this sort of meta narrative construction and like that billy works in radio the superman comics include similar framework with clark kent day job as newspaper reporter another storyteller of the stories of his super powered alter ego likewise with spiderman as photographer peter parker captain marvel is an intriguing comic book character too he basically rip off of superman and in fact dc sued over this before the marvel character came under their roof and has since been remade as the 2019 feature shazam that blockbuster too rather cleverly referenced the film it largely imitated big 1988 which is also about boy transformed into an adult body through magic there one big difference between marvel shazam and superman though which is that the boy billy batson although in this serial he played by young adult turns into the muscular manly man in cape and tights since the main audience for this stuff were young boys this was rather ingenious ploy to fold the comic book reader and movie going spectator into the hero it effective character identification batson makes marvel more relatable than an alien turned god from krypton or say millionaire turned billionaire from gotham it no wonder as reported that captain marvel was for time the most popular comic book superhero additionally while the production values for serials tend to be exceedingly cheap the man flying here isn badly done considering when and for what it was made it better than the rear projection shots involved in car rides which were also common in big budget features back then marvel super strength also aids brevity for some of the numerous and repetitive fistfights and the business of bullets bouncing off of him is played amusingly employing smoke for the transitions between billy and marvel is economically effective too after all this entire endeavor consists of smoke and mirrors cliffhangers re edited and elaborated upon to achieve resolution red herring after red herring to keep the scorpion mystery going character duality stuntman duplicity and photographic doubling the transmutation of the real into fantastic illusion making serial formula etched in stone into gold ', ' 1 the main character is bad influence 2 the sex scenes is too much that cringe everytime it happens 3 we haven seen her abilities other than breaking locks and doors 4 the bad language in this show is worse than the story ', ' this show is well scripted well cast and very detailed while have no qualms about praising those aspects of the production there is at least one area in which feel the show is lacking daredevil is not just hero he is superhero after watching both seasons am still unimpressed with the visual depiction of his powers the underworld is well represented here the gun violence is quite visceral and graphic in nature the characters are interesting conversely the action scenes are adequate albeit little too dark for my tastes and the total lack of special effects strips the screenplay of any sense of wonder say what you will about affleck version but one thing that it absolutely nailed was the visual aspect of the character dd radar sense is brilliantly brought to life in the 2003 film and is sorely missed here as are some of the high wire sequences that take place above hell kitchen cox devil doesn climb swing or tumble nearly enough for me and is merely modern day version of kato of green hornet fame btw his suit is inferior to affleck also this show is too much of crime drama ala steven seagal and could use more flair to show how daredevil is hero who has unique perspective of our world in other words like the show for it drama but wish it had some of the visual appeal of the feature film with better sfx it would be 10 10 my rating is 7 10 take away colin firth as bullseye and the movie is also 7 10 ', ' the story when you start watching the show you can tell they re trying to make you think of bryce as the coolest guy ever ignoring the intro cause its just supposed to show that it is monkey being badass 0 throwing the beer bottle like he deadshot then he starts talking and just wanna stop watching at that point on but was wanna see if it still holds value it doesn spoilers the whole assassination part is the worst part of the first episode we re supposed to care about whoever getting killed in the first 10 minutes of the episode and the policeman hiroshimi dying too even tho we only saw them for like single dialouge where he gets witty with his partner bff and the ending that just dumb animation the noticeable thing when you start watching the show is the sudden lag and it shows from the intro to the end it bad don watch ', ' the cast did great job scarlett johansson was solid florence plugh made delightful little sister love rachel weisz and david harbour does the best he can with what he has been given the problem is the story the action scenes don carry lot of weight since the audience always knows that natasha will live avengers infinity war comes later chronologically so the sense of suspense needs to come from sources other than the protagonist being in peril unfortunately the audience just gets whole lot of sequences were natasha really shouldn have survived falling or wrecks but miraculously does no idea how plot armour the bigger issue is accountability there are couple of characters that have committed atrocities one conveys no remorse whatsoever and the second abruptly has change of heart after decades of knowingly committing crimes against humanity after everything they ve done and with no real reason to trust them black widow not only trusts them but leaves them in charge of bunch of highly vulnerable people it feels out of character for natasha and makes her seem foolish ', ' this movie was very moving and that post credit scene was everything ', ' waste of time please watch something else whoever says they read the punisher comics they are lying cooome ooon punisher doing little jokes and talking like wise guy this is not punisher jon bernthal is extremely miscast if you are in the mood for revenge movie just watch saw the devil 10 10 ', ' totally recommend the story line is so accurate and how they represent muslims how they represent pakistani culture that is so adorable m in love with the series ', ' hmmmmmmm left the theatre not quite sure how to feel really thought that the ok trailers were something of slight of hand and though wasn prepared to be blown away ve come to have relatively high expectations of marvel movies mean the last few alone thor ragnorok black panther infinity wars even ant man and the wasp have been solid cinema experiences this though left me feeling very meh was looking forward to cool thursday opening night screening of captian marvel but left very underwhelmed ok enough of my experience in nutshell 1 storyline script very clunky trying to do too many things such as an origin story told in flashbacks set up for new kreme skrull cinematic direction believe the mcu will be exploring alot of exposition jeez more showing less telling please sort of buddy comedy action set up btw larson and jackson characters which doesn quite nail the chemistry although jackson can now do these parts eyes closed 2 acting larson is far better actor than she showed here m not sure if it down to the direction she was given or the script but she just doesn sell anything more than one dimensional character with the occasional nice moments maybe she needs to grow into it compared to gadot wonder woman have to say gg was miles ahead in delivery of performance even though rate larson the far superior thespian marvel sort this out please jackson is ever reliable and dare say he actually the connecting glue in the mcu more than downey junior tony stark he got the fury character nailed and can see anyone else playing him yes m talking to you hasselhoff mendelsohn dude was so effortlessly charismatic and easily has the best moments in the movie d say he was the stand out with lashana lynch shame this thread didn get pulled little more oh well on to endgame shazam ', ' daredevil is easily the best of all the netflicks marvel shows by long way loved all 3 seasons the third is fantastic ', ' one of the best marvel shows ever made jessica jones is very interesting character and the killgrave one of the best villains in the mcu ', ' let just rate aos based on what it meant to be fun little show based on comic book from back when they were still called comic books they understandably took liberties to retrofit the comic for current day and they did nice job with it some viewers trashed aos but many more enjoyed it aos proved itself by garnering several award nominations few wins we always have the naysayers with us the show wasn designed for purists and no show ever is as they are different mediums with onscreen media being unable to match the level of detail that the written word contains aos is for the rest of us to enjoy ve recommend it to others and it been received well my niece went through all of it in no time some of the highlights are quake bake wholesome coulson meg the magnificent the cavalry warding off attacks especially from within loves found and lost toxic spy marriages relationships lalalala lola and scientists like the professor in gilligan island they could do almost anything with some corn syrup ammonia and subatomic particle separator there a plethora of powered people aliens other planets and other dimensions also crack the door to peek in most of the writing is imaginative m not thrilled with what they did to some characters and some scenarios are duds but the flow from season to season is cohesive season 3 in particular ran tired out plotline but season 4 brings it back from the cliff edge they had vision from the beginning and stuck to it which is why the later seasons work so well the show creators did what they set out to do the characters are likable and easy to root for if you can hang in there until lance the brit makes an appearance he probably the funniest character when he joins the crew he cannot stop badmouthing his ex bobbi which is fun running bit in couple of the seasons skye looks awful with shabby clothes and hair in the 7th season she looks like housewife of orange county with frosted hair and fake nails what an eye roller it the opposite of her character which is one of getting in the mud and mixing it up in the thick of battle she was perfect in the first couple seasons it befuddling that they messed with her look the very end disappointed somewhat it certainly could have been better it odd how many shows there are that depart from their character to devise unique ending for aos the word never is part of the final dialogue making the ending bit of downer never almost always is never good word to use for good endings m tiptoeing around spoilers in order to air my suspicion writers do that stuff to try and close shop permanently on show they re fatigued they re tad selfish as well there was talk of project involving the cast and crew in late 2020 however everything seems to have stalled of late for the obvious reason fans would welcome more of aos as would everybody is entitled to their form of mindless or mind resting entertainment this isn mindless and it won depress your iq like some shows will but don necessarily expect mental challenge we all need to watch things that help us unwind non purist fans of sci fi fantasy superheroes will almost certainly enjoy this show just jump into lola and takeoff imho 8 7 5 8 5 7 6 age 13 ', ' wouldn even write review if it weren for florence pugh she has as always perfect deadpan timing and adds lot to any movie she in it a rip roarer fast paced interesting story funny in all the right spots good show for slow night when you don want anything heavy duty ', ' was reluctant to go to see this film thought the latest batman film would be better it was pants however apart from being cinematic treat the story entertained too the film was veritable plethora of list actors and the action was unceasing truly great film especially with whats her face in the tight gears unfortunately the review guidelines require 10 lines all can say is what ing pain that was fucking btw ', ' it hard to imagine how complicated it was to make 5 or more character storylines meld together cohesively as much as this movie succeeds it needs to lot of juggling to keep the wheels turning in this large large movie the same could be said for the recent john carter where multiple storylines created lot extra running time the biggest problem is that there comes point where there is so much going on that you no longer care about what happening leave it to proper character development by releasing entire tentpole films for each superhero involved before putting out the group feature but the other necessary element is not only our superfriends but something new that where they wisely let captain america become the new kid on the block and he eventually takes charge but the real buzz comes from the latest actor to be david banner hulk mark ruffalo he is obviously higher caliber actor than the rest of the bunch making him the most interesting character by far too bad he has little screen time one thing oddly more convincing with ruffalo this go round is that he has face that looks like hulk if that can be seen as compliment as for the villain to tell you the truth my least favourite of the avengers was thor the whole mythology behind loki works ok but his persona doesn evoke ultimate evil like some other villains guess like my superheros little more modern actually liked tony stark better this time around than his activities in ironman 3 and helps prevent the movie from going into cliche territory captain america also keeps level head rendering nick fury pretty much irrelevant he is the weakest part of the movie and seems relegated to talking to an anonymous council my favourite character actually was black widow find scarlett johansen worthy angelina jolie protege and has some of the best moments in the script the action sequences succeed but rarely exceed expectations enjoyed the floating aircraft carrier even though sky captain and the world of tomorrow had the idea first dark knight for example had more effective action sequences yet there is great amount of charisma and momentum to justify it extended running time still had fun and felt an emotional tug here and there and laughed in other places the audience in the theatre was in applauded at the end the music by alan sylvestri was not memorable his style is more sedate than other composers but the hero moments were boosted by the grand sounding score the special effects were numerous whether they were groundbreaking wasn readily apparent but their contribution to many of the action set pieces were appropriate ', ' my totally original suggestion is they do dr strange movie why not get the rights to that while it might seem minor bit of knowledge of dr strange helped give me more solid picture of the marvel universe when the glistening cube was shown connecting different parts of the universe in this avengers movie definitely going to see it 2nd time tonight as soon as poss at least 2nd time dr strange weird dimensions being that other side of the universe especially the early steve ditko version often with nick fury of h e d as the other half of the comic cgi representations of steve ditko surreal intertwinings of dimensions would be fantastic especially in 3d otherwise totally incredible film loved everything couldn t really fault it hawkeye film would be cool by the crimson bands of cytorak that was brilliant film joss wonder if keanu reeves would be good suggestion for dr strange ', ' it a good show everyone giving low scores doesn have any taste it is bit childish but not in bad way since it seems to be targeting mostly teenagers anyways ', ' jessica jones is the next in marvel netflix v deal and they have made another great one this show gives brand new side to the mcu and show us more of the super heroes who aren in the big budget movies the plot moves right along and keeps you interested from episode one to episode 13 this and daredevil bring side to the mcu more fit for adults and the gritty crowd this is not show that you can watch with your whole family but is one of the best ways to spend some time with great show all of the characters are great and the villain is one of the best of all time defiantly worth checking out ', ' worst series ever never expected that marvel can make such bad series boring story bad cast specially iman please do not make 2nd season of it or include iman in marvels movie series ', ' it not hers fault of course awful movie without any plot dialogs it was too long it not worth penny do not watch it in cinema great actors thrown under train sad ', ' am not opposed to the style of the show it fitting however am opposed to all the changes they made with the character understand not being able to fully follow her origin considering the inhumans aspect of it but completely changing her powers then there is one of the most important parts of her story that makes her her she is no longer writer of fan fiction which is staple of her identity and personality now she is simply fan and cos player how could marvel the avengers game get her story so right and marvel studios get her so inconceivably wrong not that it matters as marvel latest movie dr strange has shown us these disney plus shows are not even canon the director has even stated in interviews that he has not watched any of the disney shows in preparation for writing the scarlet witches role in that movie which is huge chunk of her story marvel you are turning into dc get it together ', ' meh in this movie there everything you expect just as you expect it extremely noisy action scenes multimillionaire budget flaunted without restraint superhero brawls new york invaded by aliens for the 2 735 961th time and the usual stan lee cameo suppose that enough to satisfy marvel zombies to me it seems like mr whedon worked alternating the autopilot with the copy paste function for example the showdown against loki army is basically transformers 3 final battle with different characters and less talented direction the only real surprises come from humor have to admit that comic reliefs are effectively funny apart from this you ll find nothing but cheesy costumes woody and or pointless dialogues tons of derivative spectacularity and plot that often seems to go nowhere black widow with all that chatting aimlessly about her past is particularly confusing and thor hammer is blatantly fake ', ' really like this show as marvel fan at first felt it will be not upto the mark but it is way too good recommend it highly so don spread hatred just go from here ', ' no other actor has played the punisher better than john bernthal in my opinion marvel should cast him in third punisher movie great series ', ' enough with these movies disney has beaten this dead horse so many times we get it all make crappy movies that make money off dumb kids enough already please bring back real cinema m so sick of these comic book crapola black widow is hopefully the final nail in the coffin of these ridiculous offerings ', ' honestly didn feel anything like emotion or great moments with carol there were some funny parts in the movie overall it was okay ', ' the movie wasn that bad also was good backstory of the hero with some 1990s background and many fun action scences its worthy to watch it ', ' the first season was good was enthralled by the mysterious past and wanted to know more about jessica seeing the trainwreck of her life had me waiting to see the next episode then the season finale was just amazing the villain was incredible he came across as broken pitiful thing and still was real threat wanted him to suffer really good job that is what villain should be not pitiful but real threat yes this is not masterpiece the first season had its flaws and failures for me it is show just to turn my brain off and have good time it did that so good job so why do have this at 2 stars well because there is more after season 1 it lost something like the antagonist or writing that felt like human would say or do and it seemed to be directionless there is so much more but just why this show should have ended with season one do not know what happened from season 1 but please do not do that take show that is good time and turn it into blah and boring ', ' pros scarlet looking fine as always the awesome remake of the song smells like teen spirit cons bad and cheap plot superboring villain washed out jokes bad acting except from scarlet and the kids in the beggining annoying accents alot of loose threads predictable alot of just unnecessary scenes happenings cgi looking kinda cheap at points could go on forever m afraid really big fan of marvel so this was really dissapointing feels like high budget action movie but with plot directing and cutting made by 12 year olds ', ' david tenant is great he continues to do great job and bring level of excellence to anything he is involved in however given that he does great job you could almost strip away every scene in which he doesn appear and have seen all you need to see for this extrapolated short personally cannot stand movies or shows that add fluff to keep the kettle on the boil and this one does it again and again believe the tv series that never made it beyond the first season attest to this in my experience the failed ones generally display this trait don want to take away from the great acting of folks like krysten ritter mike colter and carrie ann moss because they did wonderful job and held the threads together very well but believe that it is actually an insult to put talent like that into situation where they cannot excel is shame basically gave this three because of the acting only the story could have been told in three episodes and everything else was mediocre at best ', ' highly recommend not to watch just spoil the marvel image even characters are not up to mark worst acting and sometime it gave wrong message to being human ', ' like the fact that marvel disney is introducing us to another culture through this show it is better than expected was expecting to be children show well am an adult and enjoy it can wait until episode 2 ', ' like jessica jones but can someone explain to me why this boring and meaningless storyline of jeri hogarth is present in the series is this done to increase the timing ', ' one could think well another marvel again how could they bring something new some how they manage to create gloomy atmosphere organic movement from scene to the other and you end up hooked by the action as well as the more settle moments very fluid and the visual the attention brought to the details remind me bit of hannibal the shots of fight scenes are so dynamic and the one at the end of the second episode is just so credible the casting is great the main character couldn be better for the show the format of the show with the day profession the night vigilante and the past are folded like braid very tight and it keeps the interest all along am very surprise by the quality of netflix with this show orange is the new black and house of cards they are major players now in the tv series scene ', ' so disappointing almost all is bad in this film also the cgi sloppy plot flat characters useless villain all of that have been tried to be lifted by the actions scenes which were way too exaggerated good start bad very poor ending with that kind of budget they could have come up with something better ', ' it started out so good lining up with the mcu and their movies but the last two seasons are they have nothing to deal with the mcu what so ever they all said this season 6 would line up with after endgame so we gave it another shot but ill be damned if it wasnt just bunch of croc the story lines have nothing to do with anything and seems just like the show once upon time where they cant let it go hopefully they will fix it all in the final season 7 but highly doubt it its waste past season 4 do not watch ', ' rating 7 0 favorite episode self control stereotypical sci fi super agent stuff really fell off after you know who kept coming back ', ' the only reason people hate on this film is because it is female led the film is awesome ', ' most perfect casting in the mcu since iron man and captain america themselves the show is fun and can wait to see more just wish the season was longer ve already watched the first episode three times ', ' for superhero vigilantly series they did really good job with this one this show has perfect balance of action heart dialogue mystery very well done love that this show is more adult geared and not childish nor does it push harshly on controversial topics that don belong in comic book world the only thing that gets tiresome is the fact that jessica is always depressed you would think after getting over some of the struggles in each season she would slowly brighten up character development ', ' title pretty much sums it up there were so many opportunities to have great action scenes and fight choreography but it never happened the editing was just truly terrible the way some scenes cut to different camera angles was down right jarring special effects were great one moment then terrible the next also the music choice in certain places was really poor and didn fit at all really disappointing as it was character they could have done so well with florence pugh was the only good thing in the film ', ' loved the two strong female leads it gave good and an interesting back story with some plot twists ', ' solid movie yes by the numbers absolutely not daring original or unique story wise in any way this is not classic but glad 80 of people think it the new godfather apparently good for them but not for the future of film making which is now more about cgi wowing explosions behind cgi superheroes acting is solid characters are interesting enough but they did not bring anything new to this franchise that we already know so well from previous films generic bad guys who all die at the same time like it star wars episode are you kidding me and bunch of hardcore superheroes and woman with pistol and guy with bow arrow who wears leotard this is laughable but apparently our current audiences take this h t seriously whatever seriously ', ' it was said that it was going to be one of marvel best films but it was not even close disappointing ', ' this is the worst there is nothing redeeming about this movie it stunk even nick fury ended up being dumb even the name of the ships are stupid wish someone put some thinking into this mess it deserves to be forgotten m not even against brie larson or any of the actors it the story the plot the theme and the characters hard to find something positive to say something positive about this nick fury was well cast samuel jackson is good casting there one thing good however that wasn even casting for this movie they just had him be here and he hardly does anything plus the cats are annoying enough with cg animals ', ' it is very accurate and entertaining the way they talk about the culture and religion is perfection as pakistani girl it was really nice to see this type of representation finished it all in one day and hope to see more episodes soon ', ' so ve been huge fan of captain marvel since her first movie and was so looking forward to see her teaming up with monica rambeau and kamala khan as love the two characters from the disney shows monica in wandavision and kamala from ms marvel from the beginning the movie was entertaining and joy to watch each of the three protagonists looked like they had fun playing their roles brie larson gave great performance now that she settled in playing carol and for those of who weren too keen on the character from the first film may find her lot better in this sequel quick side note ve been brie larson stan since the trolls tried to destroy the film and make up fake news about her it was great seeing teyonah parris back as superpowered monica rambeau and she had great comedic timing however the standout performance was iman vellani as kamala khan k ms marvel when she finally meets her hero and idolises her it reminds me the way tom holland peter parker admirers and looks up to tony stark the fight choreography was cleverly done such as one scene where it took place in the khan household and how the character must learn to switch places in order to work together to defeat the villain dar benn my only few criticisms have for the film is that it was one of the marvel movies that had short runtime and because was having fun watching it didn want it to end and it went by so quickly another critique is the villain was bit bland zawe ashton gave it her all but she one of the weakest baddies in the franchise her motivations were explained but felt rushed also seeing baby kitten flerkens were so cute overall the movie is fun action packed and in my opinion just the film we need in all the superhero fatigue that is being talked about would rank it up in my top 20 plus stay for the post credit scene was screaming in the theatre lol can wait to see the film again higher further faster ', ' 1 what it about kamala khan is an excellent student who also enjoys playing video games and writing fan fiction she has huge soft spot for superheroes especially captain marvel it difficult for her to fit in though both at school and at home that is until she achieves superpowers like that of the superheroes she has always admired with superpowers life must be simpler right 2 who in it iman vellani matt lintz zenobia schroff yasmeen fletcher rish shah mohan kapur saagar shaikh samina ahmed nimra bucha alysia reiner anjali bhimani aramis knight arian moayed laurel marsden and many more ok finally finished this show well such waste of potential 3 when watching the trailer assumed this was going to be different because it looked like it was aimed at much younger audience and it was 4 cool graphics and design at the start and then just whole lot of you know bad writing 5 episodes 1 and 2 were ok breaths of fresh air that broke the marvel formula with creativity and unique visuals and then this show just completely fell off in terms of artistic flare storytelling visuals and action story beats are introduced but never utilised some story beats disappear for several episodes in row the camerawork becomes laughably bad the red daggers suck in every regard people and antagonists just appear randomly anyways kamala isn really compelling character to me but iman vellani does pretty good job of being basically younger female spider man 6 the villains of this show were awful probably my least favourite villains in the mcu yes even below malekith there are way too many unimportant scenes with her family and friends and almost no scenes of her training and learning about her powers which is the thing m most excited about in superhero origin stories the best thing this show had going for it was its visual style sadly it almost completely disappeared after the first episode and up until the very last episode 7 stories need to be interesting and not feel like waste of time this didn need to be dragged out to 6 episodes marvel you re not going to make me care just by giving this story to minority character 8 oh and sometimes the visual effects were really weird like they full digital double ms marvel when they really didn need to and the hard light powers never looked grounded because they re so wacky 9 liked the finale seeing the community all come together to protect kamala the conversation between kamala and her dad is satisfying final scene to me it seems that disney was so desperate to get kamala in the mcu that they rushed the writing honestly the post credits scene in episode 6 was the most exciting moment of the whole show the cameo from you know who if you watched the final episode was not surprise but didn like the way the cameo showed up it didn make any sense hopefully it will be explained 10 did you know in april 2022 creator sana manat announced that the entire show would be released in pakistani cinemas beginning on june 16 2022 this is due to the unavailability of disney in pakistan and to honor the hero roots the scorecard direction 2 10 acting 3 10 story screenplay 1 10 editing pacing 2 10 visuals cinematography 3 10 sound music 1 10 personal enjoyment 2 10 overall rating 3 10 ', ' why all american movies are always the same with 30mins less of time getting rid of most of shots persecutions please more dialogue more story more emotions all the movies are done with the same pattern acting is fine as actors and actresses are usually top ones but this film and many others are empty inside the script could be done by ai without major problems where is there creativity super heroes against super villains some jokes but nothing you will remember you can sleep on the sofa for 30 mins and get back to see the end without major problems quality is going down and down special effects and fights are not enough sometimes ', ' tone script story loki gets control of tisseract he wants to bring doom of humanity by opening portal to chitauri army with the help of tisseract superheroes must now assemble to fight this threat against planet earth it is the first movie where the avengers assemble thus being one of the reasons why it appeals the storyline here is not complicated and easy to swallow if you see marvel universe movies in order it would be nice even if not watching all of them watching few do it in order my favorite scene is where hulk beats loki and refers to him as puny god it never gets old direction screenplay cinematography justified music justified acting justified final verdict it is nice onset where avengers assemble watch it in order to appoint disappointment ', ' as long time comic reader am fan of the black widow the comic version she is character that has deep roots in the comic universe and they were wasted in the avengers movies and when she had chance to become something bigger they had the wrong actress so when you have this actress in vehicle that is supposed to be her origin swam song you expect huge kick ass movie fail scarlett johansson is wooden and just not what you expect as her final movie to be present in the role she is carried by her cute funny as hell co star florence pugh this girl carried the movie and when she shows up down the road in the mcu will be well received and will be force to be reckoned with overall went because wanted it to be good will be forced to buy it because am slave to the disney marvel machine will not enjoy it though ', ' nice movie on the background when you fall sleep did ', ' first of all think this is normal tv mini series after completed the whole season meanwhile changed to daredevil fan netflix why you just cancelled this masterpiece show don know why godsake happend to them behind the cancellation please reconsider and start season 4 ', ' the first film captain marvel was phenomenal very seriously done with all the elements of great film production actors and direction have done great job this film is total nonsense the trend of ruining franchise from marvel study not only in this film but also others as well as series eg the series silda agents were top series in the first season and then changed the topic and stupid humor the spirit of the series completely destroyed he would very much like that series never recorded again so the same can be applied to this film the humor in this film is so stupid boring and transparent that since the beginning this film presents as boring and irritating show nor is it that funny nor the actions make sense and that meaningless humor and meaningless actions is full film don really believe that the level of teenagers is as low as the film producers imagined if they take care of it more also the introduction of musicals in films that still carry the glory of the first films about the avengers is complete debacle it simply became habit of moving from marvel workshop more and more like the movie comedian type movies however far that it was expected damage to thrown money and spent time ', ' for those of you who are looking for more than just action sequences this is going to be very long film for you my advice is visit the restroom as often as you like don torture yourself take away the very predictable first 45 minutes of team assembly and the final 45 minutes of predictable one sided mano mano there still 50 minutes in the middle to put together decent story but when all is said and done you ll find it impossible to describe what the movie was really about after all no one ever promised it a movie about anything worry not though no one is ever going to ask you about the storyline your sole responsibility is to remember the details of the special effects g how the smoke coming out of broken rotating blade is sucked back into it abandoning that and you ve just wasted good chunk of your life so choose wisely if you re like me who can think of million other ways to spend 2 5 hours of weekend time you probably should choose one of those instead ', ' nick fury samuel jackson gets together iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to battle loki tom hiddleston who is planning to invade earth with full army to rule the world this has been praised by everybody and it easy to see why it great there an intelligent sharp script virtual non stop action incredible special effects and 2 1 2 hours that just fly by this one of those rare comic book movies where everything is done right it beautifully directed the acting is good there nice doses of humor and refreshingly the characters do not get along at first so we can see them grow and become team there not lot to say about this film because everything is done well just go see it and enjoy also stay through the closing credits for very humorous bit at the very end ', ' the inconsistencies in this film are astounding sometimes they switch places and other times they don as if nobody is tracking it woman with the power to move whole spaceships and move planets off course is in fist fight and being thrown around what the hell that is the silliest thing have ever seen it is as if these writers producers and directors forget their own story bible and forget what their characters are supposed to be able to do same with all of them why or why or why would captain marvel superman or wonder woman ever ever be in fist fight how utterly absurd don know how they will fix this but they need to start with fixing the nonsensical stupid factor first ', ' don know what people expected from this movie that now they re disappointed although hope these people are actually marvel fans and have watched the movie truly enjoyed black widow and would recommend it to any marvel fan it an entertaining movie that gives you some perspective on natasha life before avengers it introduces the possibly future black widow and it has great action scenes give it chance ', ' am furious with mcu with putting out these passable movies with last year black panther ant man and wasp and now this this is just outrageous and this bad movie is eating millions don know how but disney thinks we fans will love everything they put out and my shout out to marvel fans please stop supporting mcu with this type of movie which you will forget in day ', ' predictable plot and story line no substance no real character building in movie just another boring movie that falls in the repeatism of movies like mission impossible which are another series that are impossible to sit through without losing interest in the film ', ' if you where fan of marvel daredevil then you will love this show it shows the darker and more realistic side of the mcu the show has an amazing cast with great script the show consists of 13 episodes each about an hour long and watch out for the many easter eggs pointing towards iron fist luke cage the avengers the inhumans and of course daredevil the show will have very physiological darkness to it and lot of sexual scenes so if you are not of age then you might wanna stick to the lighter side of the mcu like the pg 13 movies the show will be released on november 20th 2015 the next marvel show coming out is luke cage and after that iron fist if it doesn get canceled im really looking forward to this show and you should be as well ', ' underwhelming especially because of the high ratings from critics it like reading critic reviews about the last jedi all over again and coming to the theatre thinking what were they thinking enjoyed the story and action from the avengers video game opening scene whole lot more than this first episode slow boring uninteresting hopefully the series improves as more episodes come get released because had high hopes for this one ', ' this movie must be the death of marvel it not only the worst marvel movie have ever seen but perhaps the worst of any movie have ever seen tried watching the entire movie but when it got to the part where the people of the planet communicate only by signing and dancing just couldn take it any longer whoever wrote this should be ashamed of themselves now let talk about the acting or should say the lack of it you know it bad when the best actor is cat need say more the girl playing the teenage marvel is absolutely one of the worst actors in the entire movie industry don even bother trying to follow the plot just skip this one unless you like pain ', ' marvel the avengers is fantastic movie director josh wheldon did fantastic job creating this movie highly recommend it to watch but beware to those with young children this movie should hold true to the pg 13 rating it was given there is some language and intense battle scenes but the overall message is great you have to come together to conquer evil this movie gets that message across in unique way of pulling together the world best superheroes iron man captain america thor black widow hawkeye and the hulk all the characters have been previously developed through other marvel movies which will help your understanding of this movie lot more if you watch them in advance also it never fails to amaze me how marvel always manages to work in the cameo appearance of their founder and comic book writer stan lee look for him in ever marvel movie now the overall basis of the movie is that loki thor not so nice little brother is trying to take by the tesseract blue cube that is an energy source and can connect multiple worlds shield led by nick fury pulls together the best superheroes to protect all people from loki through complicated but well scripted and funny plot the movie ends in huge battle which you ll have to watch the movie to see how that goes it really is great movie with well planned out cast and an amazing script one of my favorite quotes is there is only one god ma am and m pretty sure he doesn dress like that said by captain america so surprising that modern hollywood will still say something towards christianity it was refreshing overall an amazing way to kill couple of hours recommend it to anyone who likes action with side of comedy ', ' this is by far the worst movie marvel has made till date no plot nothing character development is joke was this movie even necessary waste of time and energy it feels like watching cartoon without any story line and the characters are so damn dumb nothing is happening is the movie from start to end you just feel the dumbness overall not even single scene is commendable why marvel why choose such poor script taking the audience for granted this movie is joke marvel has lost its touch after endgame not single good thing about this movie save your time and do not watch this frustrated ', ' read daredevil as boy and loved it especially when electra was there now as an adult the religious guilt theme doesn really work for me and it way more dominant in the series than in the comics where it basically non existent and find it boring for people who has been tormented by religious guilt in their upbringing this might be topic to relate to but for me it just snooze fest please keep in mind that have the same opinion on any religion based show since the rationale doesn work for me love science fiction but at least they put in the word fiction right gave up after the first season d rather re watch deadpool 1 2 for the 7th time all in all it not badly done in the same fashion as most of the marvel series are being done so if you like or don mind the religious backdrop this might be for you ', ' was very impressed by vincent onofrio and the series till episode 10 episode 11 was disaster especially karen role and part just stupid thought it was the worst episode like ever of any good series but finale of season 1 was even worser like way worser seems the supposed villain would ve been the saviour of the city and definitely not the winning team why did the villain just not kill everyone if he was that powerful and villainous no one would ever know watch it only for vincent onofrio and the first 10 episodes ', ' love mcu movies love this one too but just one big flaw kamala honestly could see how monica turned into having light power and her relationship with her mom and marvel but kamala also love ant man he talkative but he fun this kamala just the way she was asked to act nothing to do with the actress herself destroyed thiis movie she annoying rather watch this movie talking about how marvel builds stronger relationship with monica than having someone super annoying all the time she is not just annoying all her reactions and acts were so not natural enough if have to give this movie 10 stars then could easily give iron man 3 50 stars and any other mcu movies more than 30 stars to start with this movie just failed to me because of kamala ', ' they just cooked this one too long that the dist turned out too be dry and chewy action bits were fine but it didnt really feel like an marvel avenger movie expectations and the weird accents didnt really help this one lot of things went wrong with this one including the release this post civil war timeline didnt really was that satisfying ', ' this show is very good well written relatable and enjoyable for all ages if you can get past the ideal of all marvel shows being dark and violent you can enjoy the true warmth and integrity of ms marvel the character chemistry is incredible and you can tell the writers and directors took their time perfecting it watch it you won regret it ', ' think just have witnessed the best movie have ever seen and have seen lot of movies in my lifetime love the work of joss whedon this is by far his best accomplishment high tech magic appeared on the screen as watched in awe every actor played his or her part to the best of their abilities the action was amazing the humor was spot on pure joss style loved it loved it recommend this movie to everyone it is just pure enjoyment anxiously await the second installment of the avengers it can only get better from here on out ', ' black widow had very strong opening but fell flat on its face for the following hour fifty minutes the choppy scrapped together action sequences unfulfilling character arcs horrendous 1 liners comedy were concerning for future mcu tbh it ab 6 years too late 2 6 5 ', ' average marvel movie nothing special about it it good looking well acted and enjoyable to watch lacks the wow effect that some of the best marvel movies got however most of the jokes didn work for me but my sense of humour is quite unique and could hear people laughing so you might like them ', ' few words d use to describe this movie boring predictable cringy and just flat out dumb felt no chemistry between any of the characters let alone the actors the villain was basic ms marvel is bit too childish captain marvel acting is flat and emotionless monica rambeau feels like she doesn want to be in any scene ultimately very poor excuse for movie in the once great mcu plot holes liter the entire movie with no consistency on their power switching as well as odd tone shifts the editing was all over the map and at times confusing during fight scenes the cgi was on par or even below the quality of the cw and low budget 90s films lastly the last scene of the movie is massive pass for me on building any type of excitement or emotion for future films hope someday the mcu and hollywood in general can return to good story telling with good characters not just agendas and inclusive casting just tell good dang story again with good actors and characters if you re gonna make bad movie at least make it fun this movie was awful and not even remotely interesting 10 10 would not recommend even on my most bored sunday ', ' simple minded live action comic book extravaganza uniting earth resident superheroes to thwart thor adoptive brother loki and his faceless army from destroying the world the 3d effects aren terribly good though the film looks expensive and is top heavy with crushing destruction taking place in manhattan somewhat disconcerting in the post 9 11 years coupled with blisteringly loud sound effects robert downey jr brings his usual panache to the fore as tony stark iron man and chris evans is wonderfully well scrubbed captain america but others in the all star cast particularly scarlett johansson samuel jackson mark ruffalo and in cameo gwyneth paltrow just appear to be slumming the script by joss whedon who also directed could only be amazing and complex to comic book fans who haven been comic book fans for very long it a mechanical enterprise for audiences looking to be uplifted by the sight of buildings and people being obliterated and the patriotic revenge therein from ', ' it is very much save to say that only truly super hero addicts will love this don read the comics anymore because id rather read book or watch movie could be my age as well this is overrated beyond all ends the villain is annoying beyond all ends because you have to incorporate so many characters you have to cram all this crap into one movie and personally the individual films are much better this felt like an overdose of flashy sh everywhere and the story is rather dull went in this movie with high hopes because on occasion enjoy super hero movies my favorites have to be the tim burton christopher nolan batman films those were fantastic this is mess with over two hours of flashy ridiculous plot twists and cgi up the only super hero comic book addicts and little kids will really appreciate this if you have brain and want more realism in film avoid this crap aside gave it 5 because some of the special effects were impressive and some of the action was cool and lets be real scarlett johanson is hot as hell but this movie barely qualifies as 5 you want true action film with super hero taste go with the dark knight or batman begins ', ' to me the marvels captain marvel 2 can be considered the worst performance by marvel in terms of basic skills to date whether it the script action sequences or the pacing of comedy elements all have glaring issues especially in editing which is simply astounding the arrangement of some scene transitions is almost as problematic as in scarjo which is truly shocking what subtle is that there are many places in this film that could have been developed and the director also understands this so those parts are highlighted for example the relationship between captain marvel and monica or the plot where ms marvel should have been disappointed in captain marvel which would have allowed her to grow further in her understanding of heroes are all obvious areas for development however after these parts are pointed out they are casually passed over with pitch perfect style sisterly bonding ultimately making the whole of the marvels like game of catch the ball is potential you can always clearly see the ball but both sides keep dropping it with only few successful catches in the end because the ball is too conspicuous it actually highlights the chaos of the whole game furthermore the acting in the marvels is bit confusing among the main characters of the film almost only iman vellani who played ms marvel turned in sufficiently complete and consistent performance as for brie larson who played captain marvel and teyonah parris who played monica both give sense of being at loss appearing indecisive between seriousness and comedy as for the main villain played by zawe ashton she was originally boring character with no play so it natural that she didn perform much conversely samuel jackson nick fury just after the events of the series secret invasion suddenly became the kind of character who keeps making jokes and sarcastic remarks making people feel that this is not the same character at all so like captain marvel and monica it has less to do with their acting skills and more to do with the script of this entire movie which is overly fragmented in style interestingly although the problems are so obvious the overall level of the marvels is probably about the same as thor the dark world and there is still some entertainment value at least for me it easier to bear than recent films like shang chi and the legend of the ten rings thor love and thunder black panther wakanda forever and ant man and the wasp quantumania and it more entertaining in summary looking at the hidden segments the marvels indeed holds an important position in the marvel cinematic universe it just pity that those basic skills especially in terms of editing are handled too poorly at least from my personal estimation next year golden raspberry awards will likely not miss this film ps by the way think that park seo joon planet can be considered the biggest highlight of the whole film but because of this the complete lack of explanation about the fate of that planet in the later plot is also surprisingly casual arrangement that can even affect the depiction of the main characters honestly think the comedic level of that planet even if it were used to directly make one season sitcom wouldn pose much of problem ', ' so just got back from seeing marvel the avengers excuse me while reattach my face to my skull ll admit that when first heard that they were going to put all of these big egos in one big movie was expecting cinematic disaster of epic proportions something as awful as the transformers films something that was nothing more than badasses on parade so initially was completely uninterested then heard joss whedon was involved said to myself well it ll at least be decent and decided to go see it boy am ever glad did it is badasses on parade but it goes far far beyond that let me get it out of the way right now don know damned thing about comic books luckily familiarity with the original comics is not necessary you can get by with just seeing the prequel films saw and enjoyed iron man and thor snored my way through the incredible hulk and skipped captain america the first avenger did not have any trouble following what was going on in avengers so if you need some setup iron man and thor are the only ones that you really need to see the other two are pretty much optional didn give crap about hulk or cap when went into this movie and walked out actually liking both of them thought edward norton absence would leave gaping hole thought wrong mark ruffalo does fine job also chris evans is charming as hell charming enough that was totally sold on cap about halfway through the film in fact like him so much that may just go back and watch captain america after all let talk more about actors specifically let talk about tom hiddleston who plays loki god of mischief in this film and in thor he is one of my favorite things about this movie and was most definitely my favorite thing about thor was really worried when learned that he was going to be the main villain was having visions of him growing really big mustache so he could stand around and twirl it while laughing maniacally and tying natalie portman to some railroad tracks thankfully that is not the case at all both the script and hiddleston acting make loki one of the best movie villains have ever seen in my life and ve seen lot of movie villains he so good that was almost rooting for him okay maybe it partly because also find tom hiddleston strangely attractive his devilish grin chills me to the bone and gets my heart racing all at the same time none of you need to inform me that m weirdo m fully aware of it now let talk about action am not exaggerating when say that this is one of the best damn action movies have ever seen speaking strictly about ass kicking fight sequences and city smashing spectacle this is right up there with movies like the matrix and the lord of the rings trilogy every hero and villain gets their due they all get to show off their strong points therefore they all shine the action is well choreographed and nicely shot no shaky cam to be found here thank god furthermore we care about the action because we like and care about the people involved filmmakers take note this is how you make an action film another thing that great about this movie is the script not only did joss whedon direct he also penned the screenplay anyone who familiar with his work knows he the master of witty dialogue and has excellent comedic timing and he in top form here in other words this movie is funny really funny there plenty of the razor sharp wit we ve come to expect from tony stark played to perfection by robert downey jr but there also physical comedy delivered by well ll try not to spoil it for you you ll know it when you see it let talk some more about the script the film clocks in at around 2 hours but you won feel it at all unless you drank too much soda there a place for everything and everything is in its place there nothing extraneous and there nothing missing it establishes the group dynamic and establishes the plot and then everything pays off in big big way the plot is nothing revolutionary but it perfectly serviceable and it really the characters who should be the main focus here in the first place anyway to sum it up this movie delivers on just about every level if you just want to munch some popcorn and watch some awesome action then this movie will not disappoint you seriously can say enough good things about the action sequences if you want good laugh forget the comedy films and just watch this if you like hot guys in tight costumes there are plenty of them here if you want to see acting that ranges from good to excellent here it is if you want characters you can feel something for well it has that too sounds too good to be true right m probably among the most skeptical moviegoers in these united states but this movie made believer out of me ve been trying to find fault in the avengers but there are none that present themselves upon first viewing guess ll just have to watch it couple more times well darn sarcasm aside if had the 10 extra bucks d go see it again right this minute ', ' this is good introduction movie for great new character strong female lead and well cast do yourself favour go see it and make your own mind up ', ' definitely one of the best movie from mcu brie larson is amazing ', ' seriously have no idea what wrong with marvel now they had exceptionally brilliant series and movies now its turing into bitter pattern when it comes to ms marvel it is nothing but teenage drama the creators of this series tried to make it colourful but the esse of the story has lost half way the characters are written poorly and most of the actors are over doing it it is really hard to finish each episode but finally did it only because the character of kamala khan will be there in the upcoming movies it took me months to finish it so guys watch it if you have time and if you are planning to watch the future movies of mcu ', ' not really movie anyone wanted at least we wanted it in like 2014 anywits it dull all the things that could be fun or interesting about it just feel like onanistic fan service ', ' too bad that this is one of the first female superhero movies and they completely failed in pretty much every aspect boring story if you can call it story boring jokes mostly bad acting useless visuals whoever wrote the script must know it is bad the average tv show nowadays is so much better than this ', ' watched this on disney for free still feel was ripped off just disjointed and purile not to give away any spoilers but the acting is wooden the script is just garbage the storyline is slow tedious and dull not quite sure what the producers were trying to achieve with this fight scenes are predictable and just plain silly there are 2 positives to this car crash first being the special effects are not bad and secondly the film is short that being said was yearning to turn it off at 18 minutes fought off that feeling but should really have given in to it this movie was master class in what not to do ', ' the pacing is bad the acting is average and it presents as being made purely for middle school kids the plot is obvious and the situations feature many high school tropes another disappointment in long line of them ', ' this movie sucked it was incredibly boring the accents were terrible and the storyline was awful ', ' speaking as pakistani absolutely loved it it not everyday that you get to see superheroes whine about having to wear shalwar kameez absolutely loved how cultural elements were showcased in very relatable manner laughed out loud when kamala ammi mom talked about aamir baat paki because this seemingly tiny detail made it clear that the pakistani culture was actually being depicted correctly unlike other hollywood movies the music really complemented kamala as well as her heritage hearing koko korina really made my day the music gave me goosebumps loved what they did with the editing props to the graphic designers they nailed at displaying kamala fantasies in way they narrated her personality and lastly think the show did great job at covering the life of normal teenager kamala being rushed with guilt when she knows she hurt her parents her fading into daydreams and slurring down slushies is all realistic teenage stuff that makes kamala relatable for her teenage audience ve got lot to say right here but for now m looking forward to how kamala story unfolds ', ' just when thought that they couldn do any worse after this again proved me wrong after the endgame only loki and dr has kindoff matched the expectations rest all just trashhhh ', ' positives main cast specially jon bernthal action scenes tone and atmosphere story music and score negatives not much favorite season 1 ', ' believe the netflix shows that are based on marvel properties can be loved if you have an acquired taste to them if you don like gore or slow paced storytelling then you re probably out of the loop on these shows and plan on keeping it that way personally since the release of the first season of daredevil ve been hooked on the realistic approach these shows have brought to the small screen the punisher released earlier this year fits that description perfectly falling very much in line with the tone that has been set by the previous shows in this smaller universe of content if you haven been fan this show won do anything to win you over but for fans of the previous shows in this marvel netflix universe this first season of the punisher should come recommended to you following frank castle after the events of the second season of daredevil he is haunted by his past and learning to cope with his personal demons when new threats and issues arise at its core the movie is about forgetting the past as war hero and trying to avenge the deaths of his wife and daughter that definitely thin plot line for 13 hour long episodes of television but there are many side plots and secondary characters that elevate it from being simplistic for acts of terror to downright having to showcase killing sprees in order to further the plot this show doesn pull any punches when things start to get real this is brutal show at times but feel that it takes little too long to get where it wants to be viewers rave about how these shows are incredibly binge worthy but that where find the biggest issues throughout this particular show the pacing throughout each episode feels very slow most of these shows have this issue but it stood out little more throughout my viewing of the punisher when the action hits or great character moment occurs always found myself sucked in and loving every second but certain scenarios that could ve easily taken place over the course of one episode will last almost the entire season this particular season could ve easily been told in the eight episode format that the defenders was that being said this is fantastic cast that well worth watching regardless of any complaints jon bernthal proves that he was meant to play this character from the moment he began his acting career don throw that around too often when talking about performers taking on iconic roles but he really does have some incredible moments to shine here from his intensity to his dramatic and sombre scenes throughout this season was engrossed every time he was on screen with the addition of secondary players like amber rose revah ebon moss bachrach ben barnes and daniel webber the performances themselves made this show feel like it was far more elegant than it deserved to be in particular the character progression that daniel webber provides as lewis absolutely blew me away his character had my jaw on the floor on multiple occasions whether for good or bad the punisher has received strong first season and can wait to see more from bernthal as this character but honestly hope the pacing is tuned up little throughout the coming season because it really bogged it down for me usually like to get through these shows fairly quickly because they feel addictive and although the punisher does have that effect also found myself slightly bored at times this is great season with some annoying aspects that really brought it down for me so would recommend it to marvel fans or fans of violent programming but be wary of the pacing ', ' bro this ain even that bad based off of the box office numbers thought this would be one of the worst 2023 had to offer but it ain even that bad but still definitely not good lol almost if not all of the emotional beats don work and lot of the comedy falls flat but still did let out chuckle or two the movie doesn take itself too seriously which is relief and the ms marvel character did not annoy me like thought she would and was instead actually pretty great addition liked few of the stylistic choices throughout the film and also liked that they kept the tone fairly light but when they did try to get deeper into stuff the scenes just don work and was unintentionally funny lot of the editing felt really clunky but there was pretty fun montage sequence in the middle the action throughout was also fairly decent nowhere near marvels worst ', ' entertaining but lacks depth like my superhero movies bit more darker and maturer this has too many cheap jokes for my taste ', ' its just heart less comedy boring and cliche another try to make interesting characters by making bad jokes the first episode is interesting but it keeps falling in hole of teen comedy didn read any ms marvel comics so can say if its acurrate to the comic or not but even if did its still boring story ', ' came into watching this movie blindly didn know much about the avengers at the time all knew was that bunch of superheroes were going to work together for the first time ever but to tell you the truth throughout this whole movie my heart was racing and the hairs on my spine and arms were standing up could feel the rush of excitement every time tony stark suits up and when steve rodgers grabs his shield the humor made the whole theater laugh which made me lighten up and to tell you the truth this movie made me obsessed with superheroes and would never believe in million years would be this into people turning green and tearing everything up but that is what makes me want to see more of joss whedon masterpieces ', ' m not quite sure why this one has such poor rating that is unless the response is that shows that are clearly intended for children are rated according to criteria meant for an older audience it performing fairly well judging by the criteria for children show it not as badly written as kiddie cartoons usually are and despite few corny scenes it good enough to pass the time as an adult if you re looking for something simple to watch in the background while you multitask which if it were stupid couldn accomplish the program which is intended for american and japanese audiences has unexpected moments especially when the main characters are led to believe they are heroes the show highlights the difficulties of adjusting to reversed world by making references to unspeakable things and the conflicts of the protagonists the terrible character sacrifices themselves for dramatic moment as the others lament the demise only for said character to turn out just fine mere seconds later completely nullifying previous emotional moment is one of the many clich used in future avengers to be honest d be shocked if anyone genuinely believed the key characters would die ', ' love the avengers but damn this was one boring movie it just drags on and on and on most of the dialogue makes no sense and is irrelevant to the story of natasha you start out as she a child to her escaping the us as she now wanted avenger to now escaping someone else you learn about her family which is mess they run and hid run and hide some more very little action they just drag on and on watched it second time on disney and still can hold interest did cleaning while watching and still didn help movie long any quicker can believe they are gonna make sequel spin off of this boring waste of marvel movie ', ' wonder when people will understand that they are watching the same movies over and over again with only different heroes even without watching the movie an 8 year old can write summary of it and it would be 90 accurate bla bla bla good guys come together bla bla bla they start up pretty good bla bla bla they argue bla bla bla they reunite and kick the villain ass how original and this thing applies for 99 of the marvel movies and about 80 for dc and there are major logic mistakes also like captain america can protect himself from enemies with shield not bigger than large plate know it a super hero movie but really it like bad guys are not even trying no need to talk about black widow use your minds people ', ' was thinking all the way as to why this movie was named avengers and not iron man 3 it was iron man all the way the main hero others were simply there guess to be there would have surely mistaken this for iron man 3 if had seen trailer without any mention of the name avengers that said it was indeed fun to watch liked it better than other such movies like transformers referring to alien invasion and action sequences having said that loved the movie no doubt fantastic entertainment go ahead especially you like iron man you will not regret it thumbs up ', ' coming into this movie had just watched the og captain marvel movie for the first time and finished off watching ms marvel tv series overall enjoyed the movie there were lot of fun moments and did enjoy the dynamic of the main 3 liked how the movie dealt with hero worship from each of their perspectives in many ways this was the primary character journey throughout the film iman vellani was an absolute delight in this movie much as in her titular tv series am quite excited now to see the next project with her in it presumably the young marvels the movie did suffer from somewhat bland villain though and honestly the central conceit of their motivation fell flat for me many of the action sequences were also quite middling though didn detract from the movie too much it just what ve come to expect at this point one of the biggest issues is that once again captain marvel is not really the most interesting character in their own movie brie larson is good actor who seems wasted yet again in this role some braver writing and directing choices would benefit the character immensely ', ' an amazing movie with crazy story special breathtaking effects grand tape and johansson scarlett at the top of the top ', ' m giving this 3 10 because liked the furniture and scenery in nearly all the shots this is really generous score all things considered with the lazy story telling bad acting and superfluous cgi this is in fact not even worth single star out of ten the fake russian accents not even worthy of john milius red dawn from 1980s make this piece some of the most embarrassing and sloppy russophobic propaganda since the 60s in 100 years of cinema one would think that the art would evolve not devolve sad to see don waste your time ', ' obviously neither the director nor writers if the script ever read single comic this was by far the worst movie and worst cast character in the mcu the acting was forced by larson who had zero charisma and failed to wow at the most opportune times with poor choices of music that were much too cliche for action sequence there was no real villian in the movie other than the casting director who forced larson upon the world if this is the direction of the mcu as life long fan am fone and will not spend single dollar on this garbage with larson as lead ever again rip mcu ', ' brie character came off like robot she was bland and boring they should have picked somebody else to play captain marvel damage is done ', ' just finished season 1 and really liked it reminiscent of the bourne franchise season 2 however note m only 1 episode in and yawn yawn dont know if can stick it with this season due to it being so predictable and repetitive ', ' watched this today on hotstar it was not up to the mcu standard is the mcu going downhill after the endgame only god disney knows the story was been there done that but action scenes are pretty much enjoyable was going to watch this mainly for black widow and not for her sister the jokes are very childish they ruined the taskmaster who could be great as main villain for mcu movie not just some boring old man right hand overall it was below average ', ' jon portrays frank castle with such conviction and strength that you literally feel alongside with him you believe his story and his purpose and you root for him to win every time this show needs season 3 4 5 and so on and so forth would pay money for that ', ' marvel phase 4 begins with rocky start concocting very generic movie in all the sense of the word it an overall uninspired production from the script to the cinematography it reminds me of stallones typical vehicle movies from the 90 but with black widow and surprise surprise the 90 are long gone it a movie that feels like they pieced together several ideas and add story later just like in check list exotic locals check high speed car chase right generic evil organization check boring disney factory movie reatreading of ideas and themes with zero creativity ', ' this movie was fun entertaining action comedy drama etc typical great marvel movie long live natasha romanoff aka black widow if you are marvel fan you will enjoy this movie ', ' black widow is completely forgettable not without it merits black widow quickly devolves into marvel formula checklists as many people are saying florence pugh is the highlight of the film though that can be said for every movie she stars in not sure if it was intended to have yelena be the most interesting character instead of natasha the chemistry with between pugh and johansson is decent enough and the initial fight between widow and task master was cool the family drama is forced the dinner table scene moves from flat comedy to drama in order to create artificial conflict with the main cast however task master eventually takes back seat to the forced family drama and the reveal at the end is predictable the action itself is one of the most disappointing aspects of the film none of it was exciting and it been done better in other marvel movies every fight is quick cuts to hide the stunt double all of these list actors take big money but don put in the effort to learn choreography so we can understand what the heck is going on in fight the constant reminder m watching stunt double took me out of every fight in the movie when the marvel 3rd act cgi battle happens natasha turns full cgi and it boring all the action is dull and lifeless another problem with the action is how slick and boring the style of the movie is there is no grit in black widow marvel and disney are too afraid to take any chances with tone or style of the movie instead of making this solo film something suspense filled and grounded we have marvel movie we have already seen million times before missed opportunity to make grounded superhero feel real sort of like what nolan did with his batman trilogy eventually everything ends in black widow after the overlong final battle and everyone is super happy natasha changes her hair color and everyone can be happy leaving the theatre yawn black widow is pure formula never taking any chances to deviate from the path set by ten years of previous marvel films everything is so convenient and tidy that want to roll my eyes black widow never made me gasp in excitement tremble with suspense or tear up because become so invested in the characters comfort food is what black widow is and if that is your thing you re most likely very easy to please and right dumb reviews like the top review for this movie or your as sad as anyone who looks at reviews on imdb and dislikes them because they have differing opinions than you if you fit into either of those categories m sure black widow is the movie for you high production values does not equal substance you love black widow but hate f9 what is the difference here ', ' omg can tell you how disappointed was in this huge marvel fan and really liked albeit didn love daredevil also created by for netflix the first tell is that melissa rosenberg twilight saga producer and director anyone is the producer and creator for this and if that just made you throw up in your mouth little run do not walk away from this first sure it a female action adventure heroine but that doesn mean that the whole n show has to be all women all the time it absurd like there are no male characters to be had that don exist either for sex or as side story the best character is as already mentioned by dozens of other reviewers played by david tennant can always watch him chew up the scenery that for sure however the storyline is just tortured mean sure hero has adversary hero chases adversary hero has setbacks but in this series the heroine is either stupid or the writers are take your pick she seems to not learn repeatedly she makes the same error over and over sure she a drunk but stupid the next obvious and huge problem is if you can be controlled absolutely by some hat using his voice you should either be smart enough not to get near him or for the love of heaven shoot him now realize that most marvel heroes don run around shooting people but by episode 9 10 if not earlier it starting to irk you as watcher as it seems perfectly obvious solution the ubiquitous hollywood stereotypes are also there gay couple of course now if lgbt folks comprise 4 of the population they must be 100 of hollywood because it seems like every new show has as main character or characters gay couple or bi couple or whatever if you saw that other god awful netflix show with the other enhanced people the telepaths you know what mean when say whatever what bothers me about this stereotype however is that the tough female attorney is of course lesbian it as if the same woman who piloted twifright can imagine that tough women can be straight and it bloody offensive to those of us who are both tough and straight females watched all the episodes prior to writing this review because i wanted to be fair and i kept thinking netflix marvel this will get better but it doesn it just languishes and drags it simply badly made like the twilight movies it made overly long by lagging plot lines and crap dialogue there also major plot hole that makes no sense to me at one point the scoobies the good guys such as they are find out that the villain father can construct an antidote to the villain evil powers right well the idiots all walk into what is unarguably trap knowing it is and the next thing the viewer knows the father is now making potion that will super strength the villain the antidote seems to simply disappear which makes no sense the obvious plan would have been to give dollop of the antidote to the father before going into the trap knowing that the villain would snatch him but not only do they not do this bear in mind the antidote is already made but it simply evaporates out of the story line as if it never existed hunh what now the heroine is not the only stupid person but the viewers are expected to be as well until the very last scene of the big confrontation nobody has the brains to wear ear protection duh it just insipid feel embarrassed for the creators and authors behind marvel jessica jones comic after watching this lastly almost none of the characters were likable or even remotely tolerable the twin sibling neighbors are beyond irksome and somewhat twisted when one dies the other becomes dangerous pita the former junkie neighbor however is both decent actor and not bad character the two gay women are at least mostly realized characters if stupid stereotypes luke cage is fairly well done but like the twilight people his emotional swings seem more like menopause then normal or enhanced person feelings so nope won ever watch this again just sad and borderline dreadful you ve been warned ', ' time has passed for this really would have worked better prior to infinity wars could of been any movie really if you removed the marvel characters ', ' this show is good not the greatest show to come out but it is definetly good show the problem seems to be more about it being about pakistani muslim girl we ve had many shows and movies go into african culture chinese culture and egyptian culture and everyone has loved them shows but as soon as it is pakistani there seems to be an issue even in eternals where kumail was hailed for bringing indian bollywood vibes it was amazing but now its pakistani and muslim background then theres an issue suspect lot of the bad reviews and hate come from pakistans neighbours and have nothing to do with the show this show is good show give it go ', ' fun movie super hero action humor and beautiful special effects enjoyed seeing how each character got story that progressed realistically also loved kamala spirit and the positivity she brought to all her scenes it was good to see the interaction between monica and carol as well goose story line had me laughing out loud hope to see more of all the marvels in the future the potential future storylines they hinted at the end of the movie seem exciting am hopeful they will get backing and chance to be part of the marvel universe appreciate that this movie is not just another clone or repeat format of what has come before and like that marvel is brave about supporting variety of styles ', ' this movie has everything going against it strikes unknown director superhero fatigue and perhaps most notably is the mcus track record lately which has been abysmal but oh my lord this is so much fun watch there are 3 negatives can think of is that it is too short this movie flies by with stunning entertainment from first second to last and the short run time makes it fly by even faster the second negative is that this feels bit too goofy and too marvel at times the first movie was much better and felt more original and more true to the character of captain marvel the third negative is few misses in the dialogue but also think that goes together with the short run time the good with this movie is basically everything else the directing which was very hesitant about was good the acting one of the best in any marvel production the music and sound design is masterful and the entertainment goes through the roof into the stratosphere perhaps the most entertaining marvel movie of all time not the best the movie is more average marvel wise but this is very fun movie from the movie theatre was in everyone came out with big smile on their face the only other time have seen so many smiling faces leaving the movie theatre was after the first deadpool very strong 8 10 am almost inclined to give this 9 but this is not as good as the first movie which really love and there are few misses that reduces the score still great fun and very entertaining most watch ', ' this movie is what go to the cinema for fun sure there are some issues with the film primarily the very quick pacing this film was aggressively edited but prefer breezy film over slog like the eternals what is great here are the strong human and fun characters everybody in the cast feels vibrant much more than in their previous appearance especially carol danvers see other reviews saying she just plot device in this movie this is true of her other mcu appearances but here she has emotion an arc and actually utilizes brie larson skills as an actor give this film chance and go have fun at an mcu movie again ', ' just enjoyed it it is nice movie rating also like people expectations guess it varies from one person to another how you enjoy things are different anyway just enjoy it ', ' really enjoyed watching the show the overall aesthetics of the show really made it appealing to me jon bernthal nailed it as the punisher definitely worth watching if you haven already ', ' haven seen anything this awful for long time and this is marvel studios production the plot is laughable the acting mediocre at best it really is incredibly bad on every level cannot understand how marvel and disney allowed this to get to release surely they could see as it went through its production phases that this release simply isn up to scratch m aware that dc are undergoing complete revamp at present can only imagine after this debacle that marvel need to go through similar exercise the post credit scene left me with mixed emotions on the one hand this looks very promising no spoilers and on the other hand hope the people responsible for the marvels are kept well well away ', ' every episode is just clip show there no voice over no new content whatsoever hell could have made this myself in adobe premiere what are you doing marvel this is trash ', ' another one of hollywood pathetic nonsense cheap script cardboard dialogues exhausted actors and tons of expensive computer graphics every next step is so predictable that it jaw droppingly boring do yourself favor spend those two hours on something more important in your life don thank me ', ' thought this was going to be solid action flick and just as good as the avengers first movie this movie is just waste of money and time have seen better movies than this born champion 2021 the unhealer 2021 and the tomorrow war 2021 gave this one 10 10 rating this one doesn even fit into the espionage category of the james bond action flicks believe scarlett johansson is the most overrated and pushed actresses of her time first saw this actress as child star in the sean connery blair underwood laurence fishburne movie just cause 1995 which is zillion times better than this tripe overall verdict your generic run of the mill below average pretentious action flick ', ' eh it a marvel movie same dross re spun again but better than some of the others mildly entertaining and jackson is as good as always ', ' if you like to know how to ruin and fairly successful comic book superhero this show will teach you everything you want to know and more looks like the mcu has stopped trying to write good scripts and cast decent actors even if it istargeted at children or teens this is just lazy and lame ', ' love the main characters but the storytelling was thin this time around the mcu folks have to lean in again to great storytelling and also interesting genre send ups was really looking forward to this one and m glad went to see it but wanted it to be better it was lot of fun though d be happy with bit more back story and less cgi loved the strong female characters and it had fantastic sense of humor throughout so that lovely felt like kamala kept it charming and love watching the three in some great battle choreography m worried about the attitude of the critics acting like every film hass to be better than the one before think some just fun and frivolous ones are fine though do agree that we needed more backstory and little bit more investment in what was happening ', ' loved everything about this movie and natasha and yelena backstory was perfect and really hope we see more of yelena and know natasha is dead but really hope somehow marvel bring her back ', ' 7 10 because it was way better then captain america 1 thor 1 thor 2 hulk 2008 ', ' all over the place the movie was critiqued for having jumbled narrative this could be due to underdeveloped plot points rushed pacing or unclear character motivations poor writing and storytelling weak dialogue plot holes and lack of emotional depth can make superhero movie feel hollow the focus might have been on spectacle over character development and cohesive story singing seriously humor can be subjective but some jokes in the marvels might have landed flat or felt out of place here how these issues could have been fixed tighter script more focused script with clear direction and well defined character arcs could have elevated the movie character driven plot instead of relying solely on action sequences the story could have prioritized the characters emotional journeys and their relationships with each other humor that fits leaning into the strengths of the cast and the film tone could have resulted in more organic and enjoyable humor despite the criticism some viewers enjoyed the team up dynamic and the potential of the new heroes like ms marvel here are some things the movie did well introducing new heroes showcasing kamala khan and her powers alongside established characters like captain marvel could be highlight for fans cosmic spectacle the movie might have delivered visually stunning space battles and interdimensional travel sequences overall the marvels seems to be case of missed potential with stronger script and focus it could have been more satisfying entry in the mcu worst movie of marvel period ', ' yet again phase 4 seems to disappoint it bad enough they changed her powers but to have the origin be that bad just adds more lazy writing hopefully things may look up going forward but as for now this show is lacking ', ' this is your typical marvel movie nothing too special here should have came out years ago and really feels like filler film during this pandemic marvel film drought they completely waste taskmaster and the actual main villain was generic story aside there were some entertaining action sequences with some great and iffy cgi that comes standard with marvel movies as far as what it adds to the overall mcu it only indroduces and handful of new characters that could appear in the future and has minimal setup for an upcoming project was able to see this for free and personally wouldn have paid to see it ', ' too many one liners too much incoherent dialogue way too much pointless action why did they even make this movie ', ' this movie had pacing going and then it became extremely slow and the bad accents took me right out of it they all lived in ohio for years they all speak perfect english the fake russian english is such bs ', ' am giving it eight not because liked it 8 but because think it is 8 children show if you are grownup and you watch this show you are weirdo it is not made for grownups so leave you weirdo ', ' intense my first movie on theaters at the post pandemic enjoyed it super fun good action and excellent casting ', ' people may not agree with me when say this movie had great action sequences amazing acting and decent plot but it is true think the movie lacked bit direction at certain points felt the story move too quickly to process highly recommend to watch this movie it not as epic or as hyped as previous marvel movies but it is good movie in itself definitely worth watching ', ' the villain is made understandable and relatable the actresses are wonderful the scenes in space are amazing and the ideas about the different worlds are creative loved it and as an extra plus didn know missed this before but finally more female roles in marvel movie it kind of shocking that it took that long sadly that appears to be the reason why so many people hate it lot of people complained about too many women in the mcu in the first avengers there was one woman one it ok to go in the other direction now some other complaints were about one specific scene it an interesting and in an infinite and crazy universe realistic idea and even if you didn like it personally it just few minutes get over it also ve got the feeling from some complaints that they didn watch the movies before so that they couldn follow the plot guys that on you ', ' lets be honest this movie was big let down brie larsons acting was so unbelievable thanks to the cat and samuel jackson this movie is worth 1 star at the very least ', ' this show is the worst product marvel cinematic universe has ever released the virtual signalling and wokeness is absolutely horrible and from start to finish there is no real character development you don feel connection to these characters because they don act like real people and was going to say it bad acting but also think the material is so poorly written it doesn give the actors or actresses chance to shine will

exploitation film my rating is perhaps too low considering watched the whole series but was really hoping by the end one of the bad guys aim would be good and we could see the end of the outrageously horrendous vigilante frank like the other connected marvel heroes of dark new york it seemed pity to me that they did not make the passable plot lines great and just let up on all the fake blood and frank superpower was never really spelled out is it spoiler he heals miraculously it seemed laughable at times perhaps you will like it though there are some likable characters ', ' this and iron fist are the worst of the defenders series m convinced everyone is lying when they say this is so good it dark visually can see much matt murdock is very annoying even the other characters call him out on his personality because he sucks foggy and karen rock that the only reason to watch the show luke cage and jessica jones need more hype because those are good shows ', ' so avengers finally out but is any good no not good not bad but not good is movie that plays to lowest common denominator only stupid people like film it go too far makes comic fantasy into very silly comic not this silly comic in my country have adult themes and messages but this is punching and more punching few funny things mostly funny punching there is lots of punching first it gets silly then stay silly then feel like blaming you for being silly too with punching script make sense only if you hang on toilet wall not make sense in film people say film awesome batman awesome has story makers assume you smart enough to feed yourself this one assume dumb enough to chew off own fingers if try to eat hotdog is ok just not good iron man was good he good character funny and engaged with reason why he punching captain american not bad but too silly this one just too silly liked hulk bit but was there hulk film don think so hawkeye rubbish heros are legend god monster and funny armour man who drink lot and hawkeye he has bow and arrow he not scary my kid has bow and arrow used to he shot cat made him eat it only way they learn why they call avengers they not avenge anything they should call something else maybe call them justice league that has nice ring and cute girl in tight clothes nice touch was ok and approve so not bad film like watching poor version of iron man or good version of captain american bit disappoint recommend for people with nothing better to do maybe people with little brain for big brain wait for batman instead or read book they are paper things with word sometimes picture if liked film you might not know this ', ' offers nothing new boring powers could only be saved by an amazing storyline this movie has the same repeatitive conservative parents girl who wants to be free etc please do not include this superhero in any of your future movies series marvel ', ' first of all d like to say there really aren any spoilers because there really isn a story it all eye candy and if there were spoilers wouldn mention them here the hulk in this movie unlike its previous incarnation is modelled on gorilla yes king kong didn like that at all its look movement and facial expressions wanted to see powerful superhuman not monkey in circus you ll know what mean lol the reason gave my review an extra star is because there were moments where laughed it is funny but this doesn make up for the weak clich story and forced boring dialogue cut scenes between action sequences the other star goes to the setting and set designs which were appreciated the acting was good but the film action reminded me of wwe royal rumble match can wait for the dark knight rises it may raise my iq thanks ', ' grown men need better hobby than trolling 1 episode show geared towards younger demographic sorry out of 8000 marvel properties they adapted one that didn have you as the target demo it not woke just because the character isn white ffs grow up ', ' the first thing should say is that part of the atmosphere of the series was pakistani not just muslim because the customs and traditions of muslims are different from the culture of their location the next point was the special effects which liked for example writings or graphic images on the wall or board and other places in general the acting of the actors was average and sometimes they were very artificial which reduced the excitement of the series it was very interesting to me that many scenes were created in pakistan but actually the shooting was not in pakistan usually among muslims jinn are much darker and scarier but since the series was not dark jinn were also like this ', ' overall it a good show but certain things like the extent of jessica powers vary wildly from scene to scene and episode and it really annoying other things like characters behaving formulaicly stupid erode the believability beyond the willing suspension of disbelief if they would stick to one core myth it would make good show great ', ' the film opens with spectacular action sequence and you almost understand that the movie will be in epic scale that disappoints or does not that another story let talk about the team members first know that am in the minority and sorry but my favorite bruce banner was eric bana it is and it will be not edward norton in fact as an actor like edward norton much more than eric bana but as character bruce banner think that norton didn fit the character at all mean that it was like was watching edward norton not bruce banner it was not convincing for me as for mark ruffalo he was believable as banner so better than norton but worse than bana my only personal problem with hulk was couldn like this bad ass hulk know that many of you will surprise when you read that but really tried but couldn it is not important but also would prefer my giant to be bigger and taller black widow is one sentence she is so hot period captain america was better in his own movie he is cold here don know he was unlikeable in this movie as action can say that his parts were bad but it was disappointing my favorite scene in the whole the first avenger movie was the shield fight and in this one there is not any scene in the same level for captain america and didn like this new costume either the conversation between him and the agent in the plane was realistic or poorly written you decide hawkeye is cool but before this movie honestly didn know about that character may be because of that didn feel any kind of excitement towards the character just watched him the iron man is the iron man you know so thor is but there was minor problem about iron man he was too powerful in this movie but really too powerful despite the parts take place in the helicarrier feels like star trek little bit it was great great action the main villain of the movie loki has some problems as character it reminded me magneto especially when he finds himself in cocktail it was pointless scene if you ask me and as villain yes he is paper tiger he can be dominating villain not because of the actor because of the script as for one for one fights whedon delivers he doesn disappoint iron man vs thor fight was breathtaking hulk vs thor fight was great too dreams came true however the battle of words between iron man and captain america was insulting for me it was far fetched in general the team work works the very long final climax made the film despite at times it reminds you transformers as many people realized yes the cube the machines all these recalls transformers but there is the dream team different type of action lot of creative ideas better direction better action you just forget it or you just don care about it some people ask where is the military well have two answers for that which relieve you hope if the military had engaged the enemy the movie would have been just the copy of transformers movies and the movie would have been clich and boring there were not w t also that would make the movie clich and boring too if you ask me only the avengers and the enemy think like that as said before enjoyed but didn like hulk in this movie as seen most of the audiences loved the the punch and the slamming moments even some people said these were the best moments of the whole film sorry but disagree it was just too funny for my taste mean those moments ruined the tone of the film for me also that fight could have been serious one but no problem it is like liked this bad ass hulk but also didn like another thing disliked about hulk was he was moving like monkey at times and that annoyed me the action the one liners everything else was great ', ' it a fun popcorn movie with action and laughs but every single aspect of it crumbles to pieces when you apply any semblance of logic when the movie commits to scene it a lot of fun the intro action sequence could have had minor improvements but it did great job of making me excited for the rest of the movie unlike most of the top imdb reviews thought nick fury climax was incredible but only because they fully committed to the absurdity and this scene is the only reason rated this movie as high as did the biggest problem is that everything is completely forgettable watched it last night and already can tell you the villan name ms marvel is likable character but there isn one single person in the movie that is given any sort of character development or backstory that isn already shown in their other shows or movies the only non earth planet that can remember anything about only remember it because it had the potential to be just as memorable and enjoyable as nick fury arc but as soon as they introduced it they chickened out and went back to boring normalcy instead of fully committing the second biggest problem is that anyone with an intro course understanding of physics would continuously cringe at the dozens of times that the most basic laws of physics are completely broken and ignored ', ' this show is awesome this is the best marvel show ', ' season one started off slow but turned out to be amazing an the show has got better an better as its gone on the cast are brilliant never want it to end ', ' had big hopes for this one mean this is character who can fight fight fight but in the movie this character like talk talk talk cgi was mess story is solid and good but action scenes are pretty bad in first time taskmaster was very amusing at last he her was just waste of time third act wasn good at all music and costumes are really good otherwise its mess ', ' will give marvel credit the story of captain marvel and monica rambo is amazing the choice to add whiney teen character of ms marvel was huge mistake on disney part the movie felt very cheap and don want to spoil anything but ll just say that almost jumped out if my skin when the one musical part happened will say that can stand the latest spin offs of marvel movies based on the tv shows ms marvel and hawkeye for example feel like this movie was rushed and the writing definitely shows that feel sad because brie laroso didn deserve these awful reviews she is truly great d say wait for disney plus it isn worth seeing in theaters ', ' this show has 96 rotten tomatoes lol but who trusts them anyway anymore sigh where to start this is why disney is not doing well people are canceling and they don know why what did this show make me feel like after watching it like nothing blah emptiness you better get your act together and fast disney 2 10 another horrible disney series ', ' this movie wasn as bad as was expecting but they ruined task master hate it when they screw with something they didn need to taking someone that was able to go toe to toe with the avengers and turn it into what they did is just appalling ', ' so my rating above encompasses both season 1 and season 2 that said this review will primarily focus on season 2 was quite frankly blown away by season 2 of jessica jones it was emotional memorable and clever the message of addiction weaved throughout was exceedingly well done the emotion was absolutely palpable and the characters came straight to life that said there is bit of feminist message at times can only remember once or twice when it got grating but for the most part was able to avoid it ', ' seriously was boring her acting was terrible and drab not inspiring at all and huge feeling of feminism being pushed rather than the building of strong female lead want great female lead look to dc and wonder woman that is the movie to watch or look to scarlet witch and black widow great characters and strong leads watch it for yourself but just dont believe the hype there playing on the success of avengers to sell it shes just not believable and the idea captain marvel is stronger than thor or hulk is ridiculous when hulk can be put up against superman who is one of the strongest heroes ever made brie is the female keanu reeves ', ' even the sublime season two was still even better then most comic book marvel shows and movies each character is perfectly cast with an amazing stunt team it perfect and of coarse they cancel it ', ' have started the first episode and leaving aside the part where they disgrace all the previous characters that brought them billions of our money saying that they all sucked until captain marvel came saved averything the series is cringe af what sickens me nowdays is that ita makes me so so happy watching disney crush and burn dont care anymore that they destroyed all of my favourite franchises hope they get to the end ', ' don follow the internet for all of the news about trouble production and reshoots etc bur when saw the first trailer of the marvels had absolutely no desire to see it trailers usually are put together by marketing to make film look as good as possible but think in the case of this film they could not hide how utterly awful this film would be don believe in criticizing film if do see it so went expecting the worst with the desire to at least be entertained this was the worst 105 minutes have spent in movie theater in long time the mcu has gone from being franchise that had so great films but mostly solid reliable and memorable films since avengers endgame only with couple of exceptions the mcu has gone completely downhill with every film they feel so generic so done without the care that used to be made them so popular now the difference is like night and day they have become aggressively lazy and average films forgettable but none of them had been complete failures on every level until the marvels there really is no story to talk about here it is sequel to captain marvel that admit is one of the pre endgame films liked the least didn think brie larson was particularly bad as carol danvers captain marvel but there was nothing special about her in the role here it obvious she wasn right for the role she has no charisma as the character it felt like she was phoning in the performance in fact that is the case for everyone in this film it a phoned in film there is not single character or situation to care about villain that is probably the worst ever in the mcu it just series of mediocre action scenes put together with so exposition dialogue thrown in to pad the runtime at 105 mi it it short by mcu standards but it felt like 3 hours hands down the worst mcu film ever grade ', ' this marvel installment is by far the worst superhero related series that ve seen in really long time pathetic annoying childish stereotypical all of which are good words to describe this show the entire premise of the show is ridiculous don watch this clunker of show there are plenty of good marvel shows to watch spend your time with them ', ' the actions are good and all the story is ok the cgi is bit of mess overall it just feels different from the rest kinda missed how the phase 1 3 movies made me feel sure hope the eternals and upcomming more will be much greater than this though ', ' fed up of being treated like second class citizen and marginalised agent carter takes up an important mission single handedly without informing her so called superiors you have to utterly love hayley atwell she impressed hugely in captain america and slipped effortlessly back into the part she phenomenal she tough honest and beautiful for short this really does pack punch very fast paced and action packed lot is crammed in wish it had been longer that my only gripe 9 10 ', ' the thing loved most about the series were definitely the characters the story wasn overly amazing but it was certainly still good the acting and character development especially in season two were amazing tho loved josh stewart as john pilgrim in the second season and thought his character was absolutely badass along with josh acting worth the watch and very enjoyable watched it within couple of days ', ' the movie keeps going from fight to fight it gives you no break and sometimes it doesn make sense why they are fighting for example the fight with her sister the cgi slowly got worse through out the movie and so did the plot the only thing that saved this was the opening scene between black widow and her family even that scene couldn go 2 seconds without bunch of punching though ', ' it could have been good it clearly had potential but misses the mark when saw the 7 of 10 rating was surprised but considering grading on curve took peek at the hulk 2008 movie and saw that it was currently at 6 7 of 10 there is no way in this movie is better by any metric this would be 5 5 if half scores were available but not 6 of course it still has worthwhile moments it not complete dud and no doubt its watchable if not entirely entertaining or immersive or visual spectacle and no my rating is not result of comparative expectations vs other marvel movies it simply weak on its on merits of plot story it almost feels like it was made more out of an obligation to the character and to make money rather than because they had good story to tell this review is deliberately vague on details only because people should watch it in its entirety without focusing on particular singular points could use as examples no spoilers here ll watch it again in about month and see if have change of heart but doubt it ', ' this movie was decent enough the acting was good the fight scenes were decent the movie just doesn reach the heights that it could have it does alot of things right but just enough to make it by this had the vibe of mission impossible type movie slightly above average decent but nothing got to excited over ', ' is the main target of this show teen girls well no kidding show about 16 year old girl from jersey is aimed at 16 year olds shocking right but it fun and we can all remember being 16 and obsessed with some pop band or movie not to mention wanting to be liked by our peers so it relatable to anyone that ever covered their bedroom wall in duran duran posters or saw star wars dozen times in the theatre the lead is charming and embodies the character perfectly she is clearly thrilled to be kamala family and faith are huge parts of american muslim life and m glad it also big part of the show m on the fence about the change in per power set im guessing it related to what they will need the character to do in the marvels film but skipping the inhumans aspect makes sense considering the truely awful attempt at tv show we are only two episodes in and this show is charming and enjoyable maybe it more aimed and women and girls but who cares we see movies too ', ' marvel dead just one long fight chase battle scene very little story even less character development ', ' season 1 is worth watching season 2 is not season 3 is in between the other two the writing dialogue is terrible especially in season 2 and the fact that about 4or 5 episodes worth of story is stretched into 13 episodes makes it even harder to watch ', ' it was great watch great time at the cinema with this one ', ' 1st episode was interesting and nice fresh take on the mcu and the life of teenagers in it the story is little boring and it takes long to unfold got easely bored after episode 2 the characters don grow on me except for kamala she lovely and realistic teen with real girl problems m missing the mcu quality if they would say it a disneychannel show would believe it apart from the sometimes good cgi get it marvel want to expand but prefer quality before quantity they re releasing to much shows and movies in year ms marvel can be so much more hopefully they justifie her character ', ' well we all know by now that netflix is all about dragging out one episode over whole season but this is just too boring the hero isn even super in this one used to be all about tv and movies but recently got into reading books and you know what there are so many good books and writers really don get why the motion picture industry is constantly redoing old stuff when there is so much good stuff out there never brought to the motion picture screen before hell hardly even want to watch tv or movies anymore imagine how cool it would be to have brandon sanderson the reckoners made into tv show or trilogy of movies not by netflix though ', ' johansson as black widow seemed like she was made to play the role but her sister in the film pugh was even better loved the banter between the two sisters and david harbour as their dad the red guardian provides some comic relief and depicted the clueless trying to be cool dad did start slower to build the story but the action was pretty solid in the second half and watching it in 4dx was amazing during the tearing down of the red room took kids aged 9 17 and all of them really liked it giving their ratings from 7 to 10 to can we see it again like now take the family and have good time and try the 4dx you will not be able to watch an action movie again unless it in 4dx ', ' like the movie but it a little slow pace in superhero genre but it definitely not bad movie ', ' m not sure what happened with the writers but they just started making choices that didn add up the story could have been so much better especially in seasons 6 and 7 personally regret watching them and suggest stopping at 5 ', ' as huge fan of season 1 was largely let down by season 2 it starts off with an exciting new storyline and characters but then deviates numerous times from the original plot line to subplots with characters that never really amount to anything in addition to the lack of plot focus the line for frank castle between righteous killer and bloodthirsty psycho becomes largely blurred overall it was still worth the watch but pretty disappointing compared to season 1 ', ' finally got around to watching this since the rating was so low but am not sure what all the hate is about this is definitely not the worst marvel movie it was quite entertaining had some funny moments maybe tad bit ridiculous few times but overall an entertaining and fun movie the cats of course were the best part as usual brie larson acting was not robotic like the first movie this movie was far better than the most recent thor movie and all the other recent marvel movies or shows except for tgotg 3 not sure what all the hate is about is it the best movie in the universe of course not but it very entertaining and recommend it ', ' with most movies dislike can see why others might like them this is movie that honest to god can see why anybody likes it it dumb the characters are bland the story is in consistent and to put it bluntly was board for the entire film was tapping my foot waiting for it to just end maybe just don like this movie for subjective reasons but none the less this movie just feels like it put everything that was kinda cool in other superhero movies into blender and hit mix 4 10 ', ' it not even black widow movie it a two hour long infomercial for the soon to be hawkeye disney series ohh ooh stay for the post credit scene blech the other pudgy russian girl who we neither know nor care about gets the focus as of course she set to be recurring character on the aforementioned streamer the other supporting characters are forgettable taskmaster isn even worth mentioning looking like the illegitimate child of captain america and one of the aliens from john carpenters they live but without the character development the action choreography and cgi were dodgy and poorly constructed the forced humor was cringe as was the use of smells like teen spirit in marvel movie for what feels like the 100th time can we at least use another nirvana song please black widow is right up there with iron man 2 and thor 2 as the worst mcu movie probably the worse ', ' this is terrible show with poor story and bad acting only good thing about it was men reference and appearance of captain marvel it totally doesn look like marvel show ', ' black window is an example of how to ruin good movies and great comic character rip taskmaster and we can all assume most of the male characters in mcu universe according to mcu universe are abusive holes watch it only for action scene that it nothing more is there ', ' and the story is all over the place another disney flop set up to cater to all they really need to get their act together and stop trying to please everyone nothing meaningful in this show ve already forgotten most of what happened ', ' as the saying goes you can fix stupid and that seems to hold true for the most recent movies from marvel this one included marvel no longer seems capable of making movies with witty dialog compelling stories or interesting plot twists they just offer up the same old cliches and tropes along with over the top cgi and mind numbing action use that word loosely because real action is not suppose to be boring this movie did have some bright spots which is why rated it four instead of one but they were few and far between was also saddened by few realizations regarding scarlett johannson 1 she let herself get plump maybe she always was and just never noticed since she was part of an ensemble rather than the main character 2 she has large nose 3 she rather plain jane ', ' this movie was so boring don waste your money think the whole marvel universe is getting played out ', ' daredevil is yet another excruciatingly dull formulaic outing from the marvel stable after the awful agents of shield and its dismal spin off agent carter had hoped we had seen the last of this cheesy comic book franchise sadly that was not to be the case should have known better but took look at daredevil really there is not lot to say classic us stick about guy with traditional read conservative values turned vigilante with hero complex like almost all of its counterparts its driven by melodramatic often corny exposition forget about meaningful character development or interesting story lines they are conspicuous by their absence all in all if you are not selective in your viewing and like lots of guns fighting and mindless noise this might appeal to you if on the other hand you like interesting engaging series d give this one pass two out of ten from me ', ' well first off m huge punisher fan love the comics by garth ennis so have certain expectations when it comes to my favorite comic anti hero and let be honest there is only but one decent punisher movie and it with ray stevenson fact ok now first saw the punisher on netflix as side character in daredevil and it was great true punisher feeling hard as nails and taking no prisoners boy was surprised and glad that they managed to capture him as he should be and then they announced the punisher netflix show and was truly excited for it didn watch any trailers just not to spoil anything and then november 2017 came around and the netflix show arrived and now could write about everything wrong with this mess of show mean netflix sometimes produces great quality shows but most of the time it crap and yeah if you hadn guess by now it the latter basicilly they turn the punisher into jack bauer or homeland or something similar just to say we get the skull shirt body armor in the first 5 minutes of the show and then at the end for the last two episodes mon mean it like taking away logan claws or spider man web things it iconic to the character could go on and on about what wrong with this show for me as fan but seems am in the minority the majority seems to like it once again proof you can trust user voting 3 10 ', ' m huge fan of marvel movies but first of all must say did not read the comics cause its impossible to find them here in turkey so some of the comic readers may think differently 10 points to the script writer the lines were so good we laughed so hard especially in the first half it was written so perfectly loved it 10 points to the director the directing was so nice especially after the disaster we had with huger games last month with the shaky camera screens were richly developed loved it too 10 points to the visuals god it a massive production it was even better than had excepted it is so much better than all the marvel movies before there are plenty of scenes said wow in summary definitely go and see it see it in the theatre in 3d you are gonna have great time next time we are gonna see it again we had to make it to the movie in half an hour we came from distant town to the city center exceeded the speed limit and police wrote me ticket but after the movie said it was worth it ', ' it was awesome watch after 2 years could ve been better ', ' this is great movie not like every other marvel film where you re just waiting for the next fight the in between moments are genuine there is an actual effort to build relationships guarantee the negative comments are just men who don want to watch movie with real content 10 10 ', ' glad to see it got picked up for seventh season one of those rare tv shows that tells great story and it science fiction to me all of the actors are stars anyone who appears on the show is great kind of sad to see the coulson character go he is the show just like when marvel axed the iron man character iron man was marvel the universe it like waving goodbye to free money billions of dollars oh well if that what they want my second favorite show is the blacklist so far my favorite tv show of the year is marvel agents of shield followed by the second favorite the blacklist ', ' black widow is here and it has far exceeded expectations scarlett johansson is finally enabled to astonish and entertain her audience with sheer skill ability and heart this is such refreshing but on your feet film that finally does not capitalize on exploiting sexuality or sex appeal m talking family friendly jason bourne equivalent in black widow but don let family friendly sound cliche here the cast cohesion was breathtaking and natural florence pugh met matched and completed johansson character as well with the entire cast giving the audience such amazing charisma strength and grit incredible choices that fully brought the film to life there was much wonder about how black widow would be brought to the screen with such dark backstory but director cate shortland and her team brought more than the story it is incredible how with this film major milestones are met in trafficking awareness women equality and human kindness not falling short with action and cinematography black widow is raw thrilling and inspiring that regardless the path regardless the person there is always way forward must see watch again and again amazing action film this movie was meant to be and meant to be now absolutely loyal to the marvel name and reputation while providing everything that could be hoped for and not lacking in anything black widow is legendary ', ' worst marvel movie thus far every series has it death throws disney is taking over ', ' moviegoers need to emotionally invest in the main character and root for them as they overcome some challenge or deal with some personal flaw because that challenge or flaw connects with the moviegoer it is universal the problem here is that captain marvel is too perfect and seems merely to be going through the motions bored and uninterested but duty bound to perform obligatory superhero feats batman is good example of tortured hero who struggles with personal demons as imperfect creatures ourselves we want our heroes to be like us at least in the most basic of ways and captain marvel for all her perfection is not ', ' loved both 2 episodes especially for big marvel fan like me don care about negative reviews the series is pretty great lot of great gadgets fancy dialog good plot points also lot of great characters they don get well along also the surrounding mysteries and past references to the marvel universe are also good love the character coulson and with fury also having cameo overall just as expected show might be bit difficult to watch and understand for non marvel fans or who haven watched iron man avengers or thor for comic fans though it great hopefully more characters and villains will be there in coming shows will like to see characters that are not usually seen in television ', ' nothing to say beyond the title actually can not see how this piece of moneymaking can compete with btw well overrated as well last batman franchise movies told myself as soon as heard about this movie that this will be totally for making money but lot of positive reviews really lot convinced me to go and see it myself well what can say this is not the worst but nothing like good movie this is like fun magazine you re reading during the train trip just not to be bored lot of crappy senseless dialog lot of arrogant stupid men in tights and lot of senseless action that is too much for me if you re below 13 or have completely nothing to do and this movies is around go ahead and watch it if you re fan of superhero franchise and transformers is the best movie you can imagine of you must see this movie otherwise stay away from it and don believe positive reviews this is like the most regular superhero movie ever ', ' this is pathetic story line you have blind man using walking in certain scenes then in others not only no cane but boldly walking running and fighting as if he can see he is so tormented about taking lives far any reason he plays the catholic boy to close to the vest when his partners need him in court he is never there he only cares about himself ', ' the marvels the latest addition to the mcu lineup disappointingly falls short of its predecessors standard plagued by discontinuity and lackluster script the film fails to provide meaningful character development or compelling backstories it regrettably echoes recent trends in mainstream bollywood cinema where quality storytelling has given way to formulaic production the film approach to introducing new female characters feels forced and underdeveloped undermining the potential for genuine empowerment this superficial treatment not only detracts from the movie appeal but also provokes frustration rather than admiration for these characters overall the marvels is missed opportunity in franchise known for its dynamic and thoughtful storytelling ', ' absolutely loved this from start to finish great fight scenes great car chases fast paced and well acted just don like ray winstone in anything ', ' was really looking forward to this movie but was disappointed it isn terrible but the storyline and characters are forgettable this side quest was neither wanted nor needed and think avid marvel fans expected it to be true origin story florence pugh was rare bright spot with her humor really hitting the mark ', ' disney is pushing all there woke bs into the marvel franchise im not going to stop watching it yet but if it keeps up the pace it at next year it just going to be all woke bs ', ' can just slap name one someone and expect us to accept it this isn ms marvel changed so much of the character it unrecognizable m scared for the future of the mcu if they re willing to change characters this much ', ' punishesr promo in daredevil was amazing season 1 of punisher was really good loved it but season 2 isnt really that great billy and pilgrim were good nemesis for frank and liked the dynamic between them all seeing how jigsaw started and was formed was cool too but the character amy was so annoying couldnt stand her already 5 eps in and not really sold on this season ', ' this tv series has surpassed my every expectation of what comic book adaptation should be every season gets better and better the easter eggs and references to the mcu don disappoint would love to see it all tied into that world once the series is over ', ' the marvels is film like barbie made for women and by women and yet wasn half as successful as barbie and majority of their audience were men as one of them who skipped barbie as opposed to women who skipped this gotta say this was complete waste of time and money it just bad movie but let start from the beginning brie larson wasn a very good choice for any marvel superheroine certainly not for an obscure character like captain marvel but the movie came and the rest is history and now its half sequel is here and boy as stated already it was royally bad the director who skipped the post production on the marvels middle way thru attempted to sell her film as wacky goofy fun can only say this the marvels is not wacky but it is goofy and goofy not in good way superheroes are goofy by default but this took the game step further the plot is the biggest flaw it lost its marbles after the first ten minutes and didn care about it for the rest of its 105mins running time which seems too short for these kinds of films although 105mins was too much for me the biggest selling gimmick our trio exchanging powers even after all obscure explanations never really made any sense and their switching powers seem to work only when filmmakers tell you they work not one of the three heroines has meaningful character arc the movie should be about carol danvers and while there was room for all three never had the feeling they were experiencing an emotional journey kamala just wants to be there monica acts like job drone and carol in the search of something that is even unknown to her even the villain is just flat out cardboard villain people singing sequence is gross kittens swallowing people as means of transportation massive gross music apart from generic bombastic tunes is meh cgi atrocious the editing work of hack fail on very single level the eponymous trio lacks chemistry kamala quotes are sophomoric but given she is an overexcited teenage girl that can be forgiven monica seems the most level headed of the trio and brie surprisingly acted less robotic and more nuanced than in the original captain marvel those trailers didn do her justice but not in game changing manner guess we are reaching now the twilight of superheroes all pointing that similar fate awaits aquaman 2 ', ' yeah they went the standard route with this series all the formulaic cookie cutter roles of main characters have been filled and it has been seeded with the ordinary amount of interpersonal drama and plot points none of the main characters are interesting at least not three episodes in don care about any of the people on the screen even dislike some of them especially the grant ward character also it tries to be too cool and bad ass for its own good it comes off as fake and contrived and the boring standard science fiction tech they try to wow us with in the first episode just falls flat in one word dull ', ' powers and origin changed for no good reason as result of this the story is complete crap not sure who this show is about because if you look at powers and origin this is not ms marvel d love to see proper show about ms marvel but this show doomed it m not even sure why they did the change as it is an established character that didn need any change of any kind sure understand probably wasn the target audience as an adult but marvel can be done for all age ranges when you shut out anyone who not pre teen or mentally in that range with such good and popular brand you re doing yourself disservice the only marvel series stopped watching couldn force myself to finish this travesty ', ' unique series in the genre of superhero which is very well made and clean and its turning point is the excellent acting of its main role in the role of bokeh bibak comic character both heroes and anti heroes adhere to special thing superhero series that is not just about wars and fights is full of emotions love and passion there is everything in the series ', ' thor 2 was bad iron man 3 was worse black panther was garage fire but black widow might take the cake as the most bloated incoherent disney movie of them all 2 hours of dumb film bored to death and had to throw in the white towel after 45 minutes ', ' so far the show builds up the character with every fine details even the details on the asian culture they ve put in is top notch this season is jam packed with both action and sense of realism kudos to the director and all the actors on board amazing work ', ' marvel wants to get the babies on board we re all gona be dead soon dead people don spend money but to be honest though don see how you re getting anyone on board with this let alone young people the series is just plain boring so far no body liked captain marvel and that the only tie into the mcu as of episode 2 it hasn really established anything to look forward to the main character is just straight up annoying and has no redeeming qualities ', ' with the exception of agent coulson none of the characters are believable there were far too many feeble attempts at integrating humor into the characters dialog this is characteristic of all four episodes that suffered through have hard time believing that stan lee whole heartedly signed off on this in typical tinsel town fashion the brand of marvel is being misrepresented and smeared by horrid deviation from the core concepts which established marvel comics greatness why hollywood producers insist on forging nonsensical spins and manifesting grossly deviant interpretations of marvel story lines is beyond my comprehension in short agents of shield is ridiculously bad show ', ' the avengers 2012 stands as an unparalleled cinematic achievement not merely as superhero blockbuster but as the triumphant cornerstone of groundbreaking cinematic universe directed by the visionary joss whedon this film brings together galaxy of iconic characters and in doing so redefines the very essence of interconnected storytelling in cinema from the outset the avengers assemble with charisma and synergy that is electrifying robert downey jr chris evans scarlett johansson and the entire ensemble cast deliver performances that go beyond individual heroics forming cohesive unit that embodies the essence of teamwork whedon direction navigates the delicate balance of character dynamics with finesse ensuring each avenger has moment to shine both as an individual and as part of the larger ensemble what sets the avengers apart is its audacious ambition to build cinematic universe concept previously unseen in the world of film marvel studios under the leadership of kevin feige embarked on journey to weave together standalone superhero narratives into tapestry of interconnected stories the success of the avengers is not just measured in its box office triumph but in the realization of shared universe laying the foundation for narrative continuity that spans films and characters the film action sequences are nothing short of spectacular showcasing jaw dropping special effects that bring to life the monumental battles between these extraordinary beings alan silvestri score adds symphonic grandeur enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative and contributing to the identity of each avenger the avengers is more than movie it a testament to the transformative power of visionary approach to filmmaking marvel studios took bold leap into uncharted territory and the result is film that not only entertains but paves the way for cinematic revolution the interconnected storytelling introduced in the avengers has become defining feature of the marvel cinematic universe influencing the entire landscape of blockbuster filmmaking in the annals of film history the avengers earns resounding 10 10 not only for its individual merits but for its role in shaping the cinematic landscape it is triumph of storytelling innovation celebration of superhero mythology and testament to the boundless possibilities of shared cinematic universe the avengers isn just film it a cinematic event that marks watershed moment in the evolution of storytelling on the big screen ', ' honestly did not exspect this from marvel whole show is big rip off of an old keira knightley movie bend it like beckham character concept is visually similar to bilb main character her family issues marriage drama festival runaway plot everything is simply stolen im sorry but that is how it is sometimes it follows movie frame by frame even decorations are look the same why is it so disney lost all fresh ideas what is the point it not homage nor citation more like crime ', ' the characters introduced in the first few mcu movies come together to battle loki who has stolen the all powerful tesseract and is colluding with space nasties thanos to help destroy the earth fabulous action adventure full of wit and wonder and cleverly managing to continue to build on the various characters we already know plus all giving them enough screen time and something meaningful to do dazzling special effects this may not be the best of the 4 avengers films but it is the most fun ', ' story nick fury of h e d assembles group of marvel superheroes to stop loki from using device he stole to inevitably destroy the world this really isn treading any new ground as far as storytelling goes don know how close it is to the comic yes the superheroes are all pretty cool but that why they each have their own film feel that having all of them there didn really allow for any development of the characters who all seemed to be competing for screen time it was fairly unoriginal considering the films out there an invading alien army comes to take over the world by which mean an alien army comes and invades america the only place aliens ever seem to attack feel they tried to fit so much in that the story in general was entertaining but also seemed bit rushed and not very original as far as could see it was something straight out of hollywood 2 5 5 execution the film was directed in the same way you would expect from this type of film it had the epic explosive feel of michael bay film to be honest thought he may have directed it until saw the credits at the end there were some pretty impressive action scenes which do enough to keep you watching right the way through it was never boring for even minute however it was all very formulaic and the whole point of the film seemed to be to show off epic fights and to allow for cheesy lines from our heroes which come rapidly about every 5 minutes the acting was actually pretty good m not usually fan of robert downey jr but he played his role very well samuel jackson did what he does best playing the badass he known for the acting was definitely the best aspect of the film 3 5 5 verdict it was okay went to see it with friends and we all thought it was fun solid action film just don see what all the fuss is about everyone seemed to think it was spectacular don know if this was due to the hype or if it was people who read the comics just can say thought it was anything special which was disappointing although seem to be against the world on this one so don just take my opinion see it if you enjoyed the second and third transformers films or if you fancy unwinding with an above average action film 2 5 5 3 5 5 6 10 ', ' just an unbelievably dumb story with pretty bad dialogue as well the only redeeming thing about the movie was the sometimes funny and cute family dynamic other than that just cheese ', ' it is true that the writing is bit inconsistent in this fabulous dark and original marvel gem but the writing of the characters is so phenomenoen that could not help but becoming hooked it has been long time since enjoyed watching characters on television like that and kept on watching only to see what happens to them jessica jones is remarkable she is strong but yet so flawed kind but too angry to care about anything badass alcoholic woman who loves to hate does not bother with cliches of femininity and yet easy on the eye ryter owns this role she is very realistic and her relationship with her child star sister trish is complex and real hogarth as the badass lawyer shark is incredible first lesbian role on marvel to be so open and compelling she might be the most interesting character yet her story in season 2 was the most interesting thing have seen on tv lately and definitely compensated the terrible plot of jessica and her mutant mother which was the worst thing on the series it is not perfect show at all in terms of writing but the characters are fascinating acting is flawless and directing and atmosphere is superb season 1 half season was rather slow but was picking up towards second half to become masterful season 2 bit of disaster with bad plot no villain but was saved by evolving of all the characters and the hearty storyline of hogarth that can climb out of pretty much anything ', ' this movie feels out of place in the mcu it feels fury is not the same character we meet only 10 years later the movie tries to force us to like brie larson not carol danvers or captain marvel the character feels like mix between tony stark thor and feminist captain america to make things worse at the end she is way to op however the movie had some good jokes it was not over preachy sure there where some cringe moments but all in all it could be worse the best part of this movie is the 90 nostalgia ben medelsohn fury goose and the kree but the kree do not get that much screen time they feel like the warriors 3 with even less to do the intro does gave me shivers what tribute to stan lee would say captain marvel is solo star wars story mixed with the incredible hulk fun popcorn movie but nothing more ', ' will say found some of the acting little meh but after awhile it made the characters seem little more genuine just finished watching the show and was sad to find out there will be no more episodes will give defenders try but don hear anyone talking about this one am what refer to as patient tv watcher don have time to watch everything thats out now and get to it eventually would totally recommend this to anyone who likes action martial arts the choreography in this was amazing it looked like the actors were really beating the hell out of each other story is pretty good and there is really good bad guy which is what makes or breaks good vs bad type show like this ', ' negatives first so far the explanation of her power are meh the effects of her powers are bad and the rolling head is weird positives it its own show and that good unique visual presentation it not dragged down by connection to the mcu and the characters actors are wonderful the show is full of life colours and heart can wait to see how the show will unfold ', ' formulaic plot like all recent marvel movies but who watches these for the plot it was much better production than some of the recent output the cgi was mostly good the music was well chosen the editing and costuming was good it was just good the reason to watch this was the cast the three leads are all great actors the chemistry is good and none overpowers the others to steal scenes it felt like real ensamble piece in way marvel hasn put out in while in terms of wider marcel universe don think this will end up being important but it was low stakes fun movie it not trying to win best picture oscar it just trying to be popcorn movie and it nails that as caveat will say the only truly bad looking effect in the whole movie is the character you ll see in post credit sequence ', ' the movie starts off with captain marvel complicated dark past and ultimately reveal lies and trail of betrayal unleashing and freeing her to become one of the most dominating superhero in the galaxy ', ' ms marvel is about kamala khan teenage girl who has to cope with her new found powers the tone of the series is very light there is lots of humour to be found personally most of the jokes didn really work for me but then again ms marvel is meant to appeal to teenagers rather than to 35 year old men like me iman vellani plays the lead role with infectuous joy and is really likable unfortunately found the plot and the action bit boring so it neither great series nor really terrible if you enjoy teenage comedies d definitely give it try in the context of mcu phase iv which has its ups and downs ms marvel is one of the weaker shows let wait and see how important her character will be in future movies or tv shows most of the credit this show gets is for its depiction of muslim girl with pakistani background and that not enough for me to make show relevant think that marvel is currently trying to include every possible ethnic group into the mcu and that fine by me the thing is that it feels forced in phase iv mcu movies had terrible weak female roles in phase and think the producers bit their own behinds that dc had the first modern superhero movie with female heroine that wasn just there for eye candy so of course marvel had to improve on their diversity and gave us african asian american latino and now indian pakistani superheroes it seems to be very important to some people that everybody is represented don get me wrong m all for ethnic diversity but as said in phase iv it seems as if marvel is more focused on ticking every box in the politically correct way and to include as many ethnic groups as possible than to give us intersting epic stories like they did in phase iii especially also don get why kamalas religion is so prominent in the show apart from the norse religion thor religion doesn matter in the mcu and appreciate that we simply don know if any heroes are atheistic christian or jewish so m really hoping for few less origin stories that try to please everybody and for more great epic tales that have bit more grit and dirt under their feet ', ' the best comic book movie yet very well done in linking the single hero story lines together for this ensemble even at run time of over two hours felt there was no down time in story progression or action the characters are well layered and performed and their interactions are greatly displayed robert downey jr by far carries this film with great sarcasm and intelligence his inner conflicts would make him great anti hero but the character relies on his logic to see the greater good one of my favorite events is the death of agent coulson only because you can feel the loss from all characters and nick fury being the opportunistic leader he is uses that hurt to motivate team that might not have exited without the tragedy overall the movie is very well done and lived up to all my expectations look forward to the sequel ', ' watch it without avengers mindset and this is one of the best movie that came out of marvel studios with repartee and action that would make you wanting for more first of kind action in air ', ' it seems that the thing to do for netflix marvel tv shows is to fill the series with stupid characters making stupid decisions it happened all over iron fist defenders and now jj s2 ', ' it would probably be good if you could see what was happening me personally find television more enjoyable when know what the hell is happening in an attempt to be artsy guess they present the picture so dark that it hard to follow the narrative and the cool scenes don land essentially watching this show is listening to podcast ', ' it what it is people recap of the characters through the mcu don expect something new or documentary the edit the logo and the music was good we have bunch of movies and series coming out these years and it is good experience to remember their story can wait for new episodes ', ' for fans of the marvel cinematic universe marvel studios legends on disney is not really documentary series it actually supercut to examine every marvel cinematic universe character for me it one hell of clip show to watch ', ' this is your typical summer marvel blockbuster fun ride that doesn require you to use much brain power to enjoy just grab some snacks and sit back the most disconcerting part of the film is that no matter what we already know that scarjo will be fine since this movie takes place right after captain america civil war but before marvel avengers infinity war the conclusion of the black widow story simply put this movie does not work as well as it should have had it been made right after civil war this was more of an oh crap we forgot to give scarjo her own movie let write something up quickly also to make things clear there is only one post credits scene for some odd reason there are many articles claiming that there are 2 when this is false the scene many are referring too happens before the credits roll and is in fact just the last scene the pcs is setup for the next disney marvel show which if written well may be fun ride the good thing about all these marvel shows is that they do not need to be forced into yearly seasons they can simply add in season when it makes sense in the marvel universe timeline to add to the overall story with focus on sub characters ', ' save your money loved marvel movies but keep your money on this one ', ' 2 stars for the efforts thats it in this competitive market of tv series this has no place at all once again diversity at it worst story has no grip emotions everywhere with out context what mess ', ' ve been watching tv and movies avidly for long time now and have only stopped watching one movie in all that time because it was so horrible when start watching something don stop it takes lot to get me to do so this series was so horrible stopped watching it in the middle of the first episode something never do m always willing to give something chance no matter what terrible acting aside there are so many things wrong with this show can even begin to address them but never in my life have stopped watching series for any reason let alone in the middle of the first episode ', ' one of my friends told me to watch this series and told me it was good tried to watch it with an open mind but it was just too bad marvel has always had main villain which makes the story interesting but here it just bracelet and it way too slow paced probably the worst marvel series ', ' really enjoyed captain america thor and the first iron man but the avengers is just mostly boring repetitive excessively long mess of self indulgence you never know that the talented joss whedon directed the film has none of his trademark sly humor cleverness or pacing instead we get needlessly long film short on everything but action while mark ruffalo is excellent as bruce banner the hulk the rest of the cast is pretty much cardboard frankly it just dumb film and just because it popular does not mean it a good film so if you like lots of action wooden dialog dumb plots and well lot of noise you ll love this mess of film but if you expect to see film that better than the best episodes of josh whedon buffy or want more from film be prepared to be disappointed ', ' went into this with an open mind based on the trailers it had scott pilgrim sort of vibe with the notebook style drawings and animation think if you are new to marvel or not really that into it then this is made for you it really the sort of show you would expect to see on channels like nickelodeon or the cw rather than something from marvel at times forgot this was marvel show in the same universe as the mcu if you are big comic book fan and are expecting something of the same style and quality as previous shows like loki wandavision and hawkeye then wouldn bother ', ' marvel jessica jones is the latest in original series television programing from netflix heartily applaud netflix on their initiative and bravery to bring this 13 episode first season to television screens everywhere it is certainly risky and expensive proposition to produce this kind of programming and my sincere hope is that continue to do so as they did with their first series production daredevil all 13 episodes were released on the same day november 20 2015 to encourage binge watching which for me and suspect many of you is wonderful satisfying formula the series centers on the struggles of one jessica jones krysten ritter former failed super hero attempting to reboot herself as private investigator in new york city so she can pay her rent and put food on the table she has bit of super strength she can jump over house and she is damaged goods broken from past events that are systematically revealed through each succeeding episode the action takes place in marvel cinematic universe meaning that the hulk captain america iron man and the rest all exist though within the story line they are only made reference to perhaps stronger tie ins will be made down the road depending of course on how far the road ends up going this first season expect second deals with jessica trials to bring to justice the evil protagonist kilgrave former dr who david tennent kilgrave superpower is the ability of mind control that he uses to commit unspeakable crimes of murder rape child abuse and other assorted atrocities this is one real baddy must tell you the acting is top notch both ritter and tennent provide convincing portrayals of their characters that are allowed to develop into people that we feel we know love em or hate em as the case may be it becomes immediately easy to sympathize with jones ritter and to embrace utter abhorrence with the malevolent kilgrave also turning in superior performances is cary anne moss as jerri hogarth hi profile amoral attorney mike colter as luke cage superhuman strength and unbreakable skin and romantic interest to jessica and to lesser extent rachael taylor as patricia trish walker jessica adoptive sister and best friend as said all top notch actors turning in really fine performances also at top notch caliber is the cinematography the storyline is filmed to lay out an urban vibe of dark and dirty environment of the worst the city has to offer it creates perfect atmosphere for the series noir feel filled with grit and of course sex it is within this framework that jessica wallows away in booze soaked self pity as she tries to cope with sins of the past while simultaneously trying track down the elusive kilgrave so with so much going for it all that is left is to review the story line writing prowess to develop and carry forward the most important part of all cinematic efforts the plot sadly it was there that my biggest disappointment surfaced as is the case with far too many movies tv series and the like if story line requires your buy in to implausible unbelievable writing there is alas nothing the brilliant acting and skilled cinematography are all for naught simply because someone at the top of the corporate food chain decided that tension and drama were more important than reasonable and logical writing the fact is that one cannot work without the other with little more effort they could have easily had both whoever you are you need to be fired right now how sad it was for the audience to be subjected to finger nails on the blackboard as time and time again as we are asked to buy in to the senseless pursuits of the main character basic objectives no superhero or arch villain in their right mind would behave in such fashion mark my words you will be screaming at your television set as clich after clich plays out requiring from you to embrace ignorance and to avoid exercising any semblance of thought 6 stars out of 10 ', ' for me the avengers is what started my foray into the superhero world and am forever grateful ve become bit obsessed with the marvel universe and have the avengers to thank for that the fight scenes are iconic the actors are incredible and the music amps me up ', ' for those with sensitive hearing the overacting by the actor playing the villain is so annoying the way he articulates on heavy breath makes the show almost unwatchable ', ' the movie is pointless with no meaning or depth it left me utterly disappointed the disjointed narrative felt like desperate attempt to combine unrelated stories leaving the audience bewildered rather than engaged the characters lacked depth and the overall execution felt more like series of disconnected scenes than cohesive film the film attempt at blending genres fell flat resulting in confusing and unsatisfying cinematic experience save your time and skip this one this movie disappoints with confusing plot shallow characters and failed attempt at blending genres save yourself and save some money and skip it ', ' this was either the first or second marvel movie d ever seen it either was this or spider man 1 with toby maguire had never really known what marvel was but then at the same time all of the superheroes that loved were marvel spider man captain america iron man hulk first saw this when was probably 8 or 9 years old and was so blown away by what saw all saw was pure unabridged superhero alien fighting awesomeness ve seen all of the more recent marvel movies and phases but have to say that every single phase 1 and 2 marvel movie is god unparalleled now in superhero movies this movie is what got me into all of the marvel comics with spider man the men and all of the others and now can get enough of marvel wizardry and casting choices am just going to end this by saying few words best movie ever ', ' first off there is never dull moment in this movie something interesting is always happening it is the perfect blend action and comedy every character is perfectly cast and does an outstanding job would recommend everyone sees this film before they die by far one of my favorite movies have seen this movie multiple times and it has me on the edge of my seat every time love every single marvel movie and cannot wait to see what they do with not only the avengers but also each individual superhero independent film franchise every actor is perfect for their role which makes it hard to choose favorite fantastic movie ', ' why can we have shuri tv show it would be awesome instead instead they gave us trailers ', ' best netflix production by far never seen such complex super hero tv serie ', ' by far the worst mcu movie absolutely terrible film none of the characters expect for nick fury are remotely interesting the villain is the worst marvel villain yet and is defeated in such dumb dull way it a good thing this movie is short because the second it started just wanted it to end now the worst scene in the film and maybe the entire franchise is when they go to planet were everyone communicates through song not going to lie was so close to walking out the cinema the ending of this film is interesting but there no context to it whatsoever until the actual scene plays out ', ' seen the movie last night and really enjoyed it it was funny action packed and no it isn the best marvel or mcu movie but it is definitely good one most of the bad reviews just came from people hatred of brie but in this movie think for the most part her acting job was outstanding except few awkward scenes overall thing an 7 5 8 would be an actual average score also goose is the best marvel character now ', ' the sad thing is the story line actually could ve been pretty good but that stupid anime format and superheroes just don mix or at least not how they attempted it the kids characters powers and visual movements were just awful epic fail ', ' just watched its first episode and can relate to this character overall performance is good enough to call it marvel series so hope for the best in next episodes ', ' this show snuck under the radar and is really good it way different that anything you find in disney or in the mcu and explores the quirkier lesser known side of the marvel universe and some dope characters it would be great show by itself but the fact that it in the marvel universe is an added bonus hope it gets second season ', ' my expectations were low when watched the trailer but even it was shattered when watched the first episode this show has too much typical clich you can spend your time wisely by watching avengers again or studying new language all in all this show is worse than garbage even garbage has its own dignity so calling this show garbage is like disrespecting garbages ', ' all hail the king is the follow up and spin off of iron man 3 with exceptional performance by ben kingsley this short escalated so many unimaginable and shockingly wonderful ways that nobody see it coming hope mcu will bring back sam rockwell justin hammer in future entries ', ' honestly like the odd superhero movie but the makers of this are like the fat kid in willy the wonka who has to have all the chocolate this production sic treats the entire audience as low iq zombies no offence to actual zombies intended there is zero depth of character development and zero story line interest at no time whatsoever do you ever feel sense of suspense or danger at no time do you care if any of the characters come to harm well you kind of know that none of them will as their superheroes obviously and why even bother having humans with no super powers oh forgot the humans in it are the most magical unbelievable fighting machines they just stand there wasting anything in their path and im not talking about the super heroes here rambo is but beginner compared to them every single facet of this farce is totally predictable from start to finish its one of those where you pray your transported to another reality and the bad guys actually win technically its all good except the sound department have again gone mental the action scenes are incredibly loud and were at times quite painful on the ears seriously and then the speaking parts were often so whispered and muffled sounding m sure during post the sound guys sit there with the best sound system money can buy but the reality is their mix doesn translate well across systems bad sound isn the problem its the post mixing hear this issue on far to many movies these days and its ruining many films the acting by some of the cast is decent considering the ridiculously poor script they have to work with but in no way will any of them be remembering their part in this movie during their twilight years this is money and profile job nothing more even then do have to wonder if putting your name to this is actually worth it the directing is amateur hour his her don know and don care focus is squarely on action and fx so why not just have the fx team direct it as they certainly would have done better job than the lucky ducky who managed to land this lucrative job do wonder if the director has actually ever watched movie to see how one directs actors anyway cant say much more about this nonsense except if you enjoy movie which is one long mind numbing boring action scene aimed at dumbed down populace then this is for you ps cannot believe this movie gained so much favourable reviews certainly smell rat ', ' the only reason gave this rating of 5 is because like the character of coulson the plots get cheesy sometimes and the acting isn great skye is particularly annoying character there is very little to like about the other characters probably due to the fact is that the writing and development of the characters is pretty 1 dimensional overall pretty disappointing certainly not binge worthy series to watch on netflix ', ' enjoyed this series much to my surprise although the script could of been tighter and 8 episodes would of been enough as it drags somewhat its obvious they couldn keep good thing going over all 13 mores the pity its recommended ', ' your main protagonists have to lose something to gain something in previous projects we seen our hero lose so many things in order to became superhero this is something you can take away from the story ms marvel origin is laughable this show is made for high school kids but my own sister doesn like it good cinematography and visuals doesn change the fact that plot is as thin as paper towels want to love the show but not much is going on she get her powers in the first episode without breaking sweat in later episode may be story becomes interesting but first episode and trailer is enough to know that not gonna happen as child mark suffered from his trauma that ultimately gave him the power to became moon knight later in his life kamala is older than mark and her family just scold her to get good grades that not an internal conflict any ways just check out the show for yourself maybe you like it ', ' gave 1 star for yelena the only thing worth watching in this dull fest 2 hrs 15 ll never get back who gave this decent review just because movie has big budget doesn mean it good skip it ', ' 3 5 out of 5 stars black widow is pretty fair superhero film that gives scarlett johansson her own film giving some backstory to the character and setting that takes place after captain america civil war before the character faces her fate its in between installment which adds few new characters additions and some exciting action sequences did find the plot to be weak and underdeveloped villain what worked it was great to see little backstory of black widow the opening scene with natasha and her sister being little with the family only to be separated the girls are trained to be super assassins through russian experimental training the film feels more like an esponiage action movie than superhero with skilled assassins that are controlled natasha and her sister goal through the movie is to go after the leader of the program to kill him which is also the weakest part of the movie is the plot the action sequences are awesome it has chases fighting and aerial combat as characters are free falling and fighting at the same time and snow setting prison compound that has an avalanche crashing down the cast ensemble is also good scarlett johanson is great florence pugh stole the spotlight playing her sister character who always wanted to have normal life and family but all is stripped away during there childhood david harbour and rachel weisz were great playing there parents what did not work the pacing of the film the first hour is fast moving with chases and action set pieces back to back after the family gets together things slow down and loses its steam until the climax comes around the film also plays itself seriously compared to other mcu films which had the fun tone also found the villain taskmaster to be underdeveloped it gives challenge to natasha and her sister as it chases them down through tank vehicle or when he is on foot it mimicks there combat style very brief story goes behind taskmaster that character just feels like it is there to give reason behind all the action dreykov played by ray winstone who is another bad guy behind the red room experiment is kind of tedious as the villain overall black widow is fair entry in the mcu it has great action sequences but slow moving direction and forgotten villain that may bring down the film florence pugh and other characters are fun additions there is one post credit scene that is worth staying ', ' rating 6 have watched all the mcu movies till date and read lot of comics however had zero idea about this character thought of giving this tv show try and it good would say it quirky and offbeat the marketing team has probably done below par job at advertising this show considering it mcu was expecting this show to have wider reach but anyway the good parts of the show are it humor animation soundtrack and the references the plot is fairly simple monkey out for vengeance won say it a must watch but you can stream it when you have time to kill ', ' and it only slightly better then that marvel seemed to be more focused on quantity of shows then quality get diversity and they did it well with shang chi but this just ain it ', ' look love all things marvel tried to watch this show even watched all the episodes but it so so bad not really the acting not the greatest but the story line and everything in between is terrible the fact that the actress came out blaming people scared because one pakistan muslim is ridiculous no honey it because the show is trash ', ' why would marvel tarnish their track record with garbage story line and pathetic acting this show is for 10 year olds m praying it gets more serious or m going to cancel disney plus until the next series show looks more like disney channel show that should be next to icarley ', ' has the global situation grown so bleak that the populace has regressed to comic books for escapism entertainment judging by the enormous popularity of everything cinematic based on superheroes and sci fi extravaganzas suppose the answer is yes to sit in one place for an excess of 2 hours and witness the destruction derby that is the apocalyptic bad guys in the form of light spear carrying loki tom hiddleston against samuel jackson shield cast of make believe folks robert downey jr in armor chris evans in his captain america halloween costume mark ruffalo unconvincingly transforming into the hulk chris hemsworth as hammer wielding thor scarlett johansson as pretty black widow and jeremy renner as hawkeye all out to make life sustainable for the leasers like stellan skarsg rd clark gregg and colbie smulders is feat in itself for movies of this type this one has more color and imaginative loco devices that most and therefore suppose it remains at the top of the heap when will these characters run out of tales the answer likely is when the movie public stops ling up for these epics grady harp ', ' marvel movies have never received low rating from me could this be joke truth be told it wasn as good as it could have been basically the whole thing was dull lengthy and doo doo there seems to be lot of information lacking making things very confusing it had thrown me off within the first ten minutes actually stood up to take bathroom break the only enjoyable aspect here was the graphics literally the graphics and the fighting were by far the most appealing things ', ' ve been using for while rating system that considers watchability factor acting and plot the rating system goes from 1 to 10 with 5 points given to the watchability factor 2 for the acting and 3 for the plot the scoring works as follows watchability factor 5 spectacular worth watching over and over again 4 outstanding will watch several times 3 really good movie will watch more than once 2 good movie may watch more than once 1 ok movie but once is enough acting 2 spectacular oscar worthy 1 really good enhanced the plot 0 movie wasn about the acting plot 3 spectacular nothing else like it in the genre nominated for best picture oscars 2 makes you think well after unique 1 interesting idea story 0 run of the mill the avengers one point for being an ok movie but that it no acting no plot no value just explosions and silly jokes terrible just skip it ', ' 4 episodes down believe the show is for kids only and lot is not connecting with real world situation disney has declined to its very low marvel is just want to take on every story which has little superhero element not down voting because of pakistan but everything shown here is what pakistan as country could have been or its cultural value around the world 1st gen pakistani or asian for the matter cannot be that open minded or welcomed in an american society it is just dream for all migrants almost all songs are from bollywood and the reference from ddlj baazigar was so stupid fake presentation would say the streets of pakistan is not what it has been shown here none of them wearing white kurta pajama or traditional islamic cloths which usually people in pakistan are wearing surely not filmed in pakistan the story has touched the ind pak partition from the begining am sure the glimpse of the bloody partition will bring tears for many and at the end of 4th episode you will get to see bit but it is far from reality the actors are trying too hard to deliver the english script may be just excited to be part of disney marvel show not sure why this story needs to be told can be ignored ', ' things move along well enough until the family is reunited from there the movie loses any understanding of itself is it comedy an action adventure the childish feminist tropes like men only think women are mad when they are having their periods is dated and childish got out to check on my dog and missed 15 minutes of the movie family reunion scene and didn miss anything plot wise just waste of screen time ', ' have been waiting for an avengers movie for well over decade and when found out that it was even in the pipeline was beside myself with excitement went to see the movie with somewhat high expectations due to the cast involved and the previous marvel movies building up to this title have to say that it completely surpassed my expectations and was amazed throughout the entire movie attended the screening in 3d and honestly have no idea why people had anything bad to say about the 3d in this movie as it was quite brilliant for me the underrated characters in the movie are black widow and hawkeye felt that these characters were portrayed perfectly by scarlett johansson and jeremy renner also felt that we have finally found perfect actor in mark ruffalo to play the hulk the two actors that have recently played bruce banner the hulk have been pretty good but both seemed to be lacking in something but could never put my finger on it thoroughly enjoyed seeing mark ruffalo as bruce banner and the hulk overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is first class action movie it also has great mixture of comedic value and deal of seriousness can see exactly why there has been massive explosion of potential marvel movies in the pipeline and cannot wait to see what the sequel could bring feel that hawkeye and black widow could definitely have their own movies if not movie where they are working together also hope that the people at marvel and disney have identified mark ruffalo great ability to play bruce banner the hulk in such great way and maybe look into rebooting the entire franchise would highly recommend this movie across all age ranges as there is something for everyone also cannot wait for this movie to come out on blu ray ', ' reviews this is okish but this shot shout be considered watching after you have completed watch agent carter season 1 and 2 although this shot tells you more about the overall connection of carter with mcu so you should watch it ', ' marvel one shot agent carter agent carter is gift to the world this one shot basically is short pilot for the two delightful seasons of agent carter own show detailing her life after captain america plunges into the arctic somehow she went from spy master field operative during the war to being treated like crap for being woman in man world she completes mission that came about while the boys were out drinking and nearly gets disciplined for it it ridiculous howard stark has to step in and save the day even though carter abilities earn her place in leadership it misogynistic even when it working in her favor but still it nice to see her rub the men noses in their horribleness ', ' the acting is very bad and amateur the script is lazy felt bored and skipped many places the fight scenes nice ', ' the movie wasn as detailed towards her background as other marvel origin stories like captain america for example which is super detailed feel that this movie didn need that because brie has 7 9 movie contract and it mainly movie to make ppl know bit about her and to introduce her before endgame in the future mcu movies we will find out more about captain marvel so don think it should be criticized negatively about not going over her origin that well overall give it an 8 out of 10 love the old nick fury and the storyline ', ' have been huge fan of season 1 2 it would have been way better if daredevil was kept as superhero this season made him look very ordinary too much drama rustic twists and sobby background stories killed the original thrill of the series ', ' had this been marketed as family drama on level of poorly conceived written nickolodeon disney show for kids it might not have fared so poorly with so many but the bait switch from the story of comic book character people know and love to family drama with faint hints of powers is dirty trick and one that drew people in for episode 1 but not for the rest of this or other seasons don watch kids shows even found marvel runaways to be unbearably awful and the other trash bin marvel series what if truly cringe worthy but like the idea of muslim girl hero only this one is awful to her family and to her best friend who would obviously do anything for her while she strings him along her sidekick friend and her brother are the only redeeming features of this truly bad kids show family drama which is not marvel level production even given the horrific runaways and what if being included in their repertoire can marvel not make good kids show also d argue that the 10 star ratings are review bombers trying to compensate for the 1 star ratings purely out of political correctness if you want to do right by muslim superhero how about having the character and show not be awful ', ' the avengers succeeded in successfully creating cinematic universe something that had never really been tried before but now is tried too much this is the only time when it really worked and this movie is the reason the avengers is incredible with it a list cast of actors and it incredibly comedic dialogue that sounds cheesy out of context but still works regardless this film feels like true comic book movie it so fun to see incredible action scenes with all your favorite super heroes of the last 4 years the avengers will forever be an achievement of modern film and hopefully people eventually let marvel do what they do best for years to come ', ' hate to write anything that starts with this is crap but m afraid this is crap have always loved the punisher story loved the comics as kid loved the films and the whole antihero thing but this rendition of the punisher is not the punisher at all unless the punisher story has suddenly changed to oh how badly had it in afghanistan after invaded the country and could you all please feel so sorry for me because have ptsd after stoved guys head in with brick tried real hard to like this series went the first four episodes yearning for the punisher to appear and then nothing punisher less complete lack of punisher goodness there is guy who could be the punisher but he so wrapped up in his self pity military mistakes and self loathing alongside the endless flash backs to afghanistan may as well have been watching painful repeat of the hurt locker or the green zone m sorry guys but this is terrible series however if you have never seen the punisher before if you don know the true story behind this fantastic archetypal character then please dive right on in and watch away but whatever you do don watch anything else written or televised about the punisher because you are never going to understand what is going on because this series is not the punisher not by very long mark ', ' if you re expecting superhero movie well this isn one it basically distaff james bond with more childhood trauma but for that it generally good like lot of mcu movies black widow assumes you ve watched all the other movies and remember who everyone is it seems to also assume we ll understand the little story it tells in the credits which is more impressionistic than informative was pretty much at loss for the first 1 2 hour at first this movie felt like d already seen it there a fight scene on bridge that could have sworn d already seen even though the movie just came out and it really took while before that sense of deja vu ended at first wasn sure if wanted to keep going but once the excellent florence pugh shows up as the protagonist sister and the movie starts delving into the nature of family and some moral grey zones things get more interesting and the final half hour of explosions and twists and hurtling through the sky is impressively action even if no one has ray vision while this movie insistence on not explaining things to non mcu fanatics practice it returns to in final coda and some rote early scenes keep this from being as good as it could have been overall this is an entertaining movie recommended ', ' so this tv ma show full of action about person who got blinded as kid after saving old man from getting hit from car is very different then the movie this show don get is great with sexual content makes this action but get it it is like zombie but zombie sends shiver down your spine and adds more detail showing liv visions and how she turned into zombie and the zombie played by rose mclever is great daredevil is really like zombie and you should watch both shows daredevil season 2 comes out 2016 and zombie and still going and new episodes are on at 9 8 central on cw daredevil is my favorite and am so sad it returns next year ', ' think the movie was good and they used great actors in it especially chris evens as captain america in my opinion he better as captain america than human torch because like that he made captain america brought back from world war 2 era to the present the hulk was good as well in the movie my only bad thing is the hulk should of talked more in the fight scenes but everything else it was good like the idea of marvel making cinematic universe based on modern era with marvel characters think marvel should expand more with putting the characters from the tv series as well in the movies like for example daredevil and others as well and marvel should get the rights for spiderman to be in the cinematic universe ', ' okay the second saw that they had turned marvel into an anime knew it would suck mean come on there is no way this could be good the humor is fun and the fact that it is so awkward and horrible just makes it so much better but please watch actual marvel not this it sucks and that why like it ', ' probable the best marvel tv series matt murdoch daredevil is beautifully acted by charlie cox with incredible attention to detail the complexities of his character are brilliantly and profoundly explored his interpersonal relationships add grit and depth to an already gutsy show matt best friend foggy adds some comic relief amoungst the grit and melancholy of matt character along with karen page foggy tries to guide matt through his conflicted double life although at times this can become slightly annoying when he keeps going over the same old ground another slight niggle is daredevils un nerving ability to render people unconscious without ever killing anyone the probability of knocking that many people out without killing anyone or causing serious brain damage is about zilt but then this is marvel anyway moving on to the absolute star of the show wilson fisk just an amazing character who has everything you could possibly want in super villain great and slightly disturbing back story level of intelligence and manipulation that is almost unrivalled super human strength no idea where it came from and of course something every super villain needs weakness he not the only brilliant villain madame gao is also excellent and the punisher who is half hero half villain also benjamin dex poindexter aka bullseye is future phycopathic super villain in the making my major disappointed about this series is that we won see many if any like it in the future this series was made for netflix and therefore had more adult and grittier content unfortunately now marvel tv has gone over to disney plus were going to see lot more weaker blander and child friendly efforts like hawkeye ', ' there a sense of infancy and an accompanying intimacy despite the large scale ending because avengers assemble 2012 is for all intents and purposes so retrospectively small and yet actually so big it represents keen unprecedented challenge for writer director joss whedon and it was surprise success to the delight of many fan and studio head across the globe the fact it pulls off six character crossover without clear protagonist ll add is impressive and slightly concerning it also consistently entertaining and fast paced packing in all the action and spectacle you expect along with the quick character moments that make it stand out there the occasionally hammy line or ever so slightly cheesy moment actually evocative of whedon style that only more amplified by the distance afforded by time and the fact that this flick wasn what the mcu now is nor was it what the mcu then was as it represented shift in the universe that was then shifted again rather quickly these inconsistencies of tone and character both past and prophetic future aren major issues and are often marked by moments of clairvoyant clarity or otherwise pitch perfection pertaining to comic book character personas and as such the relatively plotless piece is still delight to behold it smashy bashy finale is also especially well realised though showing its age now and feels like tangible sequence rather than series of green screen sets connected by digital extensions it isn the best marvel film but it represented big leap for the studio and the genre as whole and is an enjoyable ride throughout 8 10 ', ' have learned to love marvel expect certain level of quality of their movies m so disappointed this movie was so generic and forgettable really if they ve cast liam neeson as the black widow d enjoyed it more no red guardian kicking ass really who that girl that was the big villain ve missed it really everything is so forgettable about this movie such shame it has been months waiting for marvel come back ', ' this movie is just weird it tries to be dark spy movie but using the marvel formula at first you think it going to be dark action movie judging by the amazing opening credits but it turned out to be half dark half colorful mess the plot is absolutely pointless and the villains are completely forgettable taskmaster was massive disapointment and not to mention dreykov and the widows halfway through the film the dialogue was so boring that was forcing myself not to fall asleep and the third act is completely nonsense with noticeable cgi the comedy is ok red guardian is the comic relief of the movie sometimes he gets the jokes right sometimes not the action fighting sequences are lame and the score is meh the best scene of the movie was the post credit scene which didn fail to get me excited for the future of the mcu also there were some nice comebacks from previous movies which enjoyed very much the star of the movie was definetly yelena belova even with the bad script florence pugh still managed to portray her character amazingly m excited to see where her character is going from now on ', ' this show truly needs appreciation and is undoubtedly one of the best tv shows that watched tried to watch it in span of couple of days but couldn resist so finished each season in 2 days and it was all done within week and definitely enjoyed each episode unlike any other mcu series this was at another level due to its compelling storyline great characters and fast paced action scenes it needed to go bit more in depth and would have loved to see more seasons because there was clearly potential to extend beyond 3 seasons the last season was quite engaging and it leaves you wanting more charlie cox as the matt murdock was perfect and the soundtrack is pretty amazing makes your blood pump even through the whisper of the name daredevil ', ' the film is bland it just blockbuster cheese the film was blatant copy of both atomic blonde and red sparrow ', ' ms marvel is the first worst series of mcu and second is multiverse of madness character ratings from my side out of 5 kamala khan 0 5 bruno 4 kamran 3 5 nakia 3 5 kareem 3 5 aisa 4 kamala mother 0 5 kamala father 4 5 kamala brother 4 ', ' story is too flat and very poor screenplay second half fully took from the charlie angels movie talented actor mr david harbour character red guardian is total waste weak story plot and the villain actions is unclear and the taskmaster is useless in the movie every marvel fan should avoid this movie ', ' defining characteristic of the mcu fandom has long been its inability to deal with death usually marvel action scenes have little weight seeing as almost nobody dies or visibly runs the risk and so when even someone bland and disposable like quicksilver gets axed fangirls will start petition to revive him yes this seriously happened you can imagine then the tears that came when avengers infinity war dropped and its villain proved to be serious threat only to have most of his victims return by the time we got avengers endgame even their worst and most heartbreaking wasn too bad however one death that still meant something was that of natasha black widow romanoff scarlett johansson in the latter production what must we do to help the fanboys cope wonder simple include her in midquel set after civil war featuring bit characters that are absent and unmentioned by the time infinity war plot comes along the mcu canon has always seemed remarkably well thought out but as proven by captain marvel it gets tricky when they start adding major events in the middle some of you already know what think of loki and tfatws but let focus on just the movies for now the plot after the events of civil war self exiled avenger and former h e d agent natasha romanoff finds that her troubled past in the kgb briefly alluded to in age of ultron is catching up with her as she reconnects with other black widows florence pugh as her adoptive sister rachel weisz as her adoptive mother and the red guardian david harbour russia equivalent to captain america there also natasha former h e d colleague played by t fagbenle name am not 100 sure m actually allowed to say liked the prologue more than anything else we see younger versions of both natasha and yelena the pugh character whose younger self looks more like the johansson character and vice versa as their black widow lives truly hauntingly begin the subsequent credits montage is visual feast though the spooky lullaby cover of nirvana smells like teen spirit won be universally adored and nothing else in the film compares to it still this long overdue solo adventure is occasionally gripping and uses its classic spy movie tropes charmingly even if some concepts are too dumb for even austin powers but considering how wild and out there the rest of mcu phase four is getting with multiverses time keepers et al this comparatively vanilla comic book movie may be too little too late for most geeks barring the hardcore black widow fans some of it gets pretty dark then punctuated and deflated by the typical mcu comedy which gets way worse halfway through the effects and shoddy greenscreens won be huge draw either all of this is shame considering this is the first proper mcu film release since 2019 disney along with the usual journalists have admittedly done their damndest to generate juicy pr there was fruitful attempt to get rise out of angry nerds with articles claiming men will be put in their place by this movie and outright squeam sic at the sight of women kicking ass which the other side was naturally meant to laud as the most empowering thing since ghostbusters ocean 8 and the all female reboot of die zombiej ger that just decided to make but people are getting smarter at least when it comes to films like charlie angels wonder woman 1984 and now this even twitter feminists can see through the narrative that these movies were hated purely because they star celebrate women bad movies are bad movies no matter what the message is or pretends to be or who you can spite by supporting it yes some dudebros still got mad at the article but even then many of them just seemed weary of the same old spiel and how transparent it getting while m sure disney coaxed one or two angry videos out of the quartering and geeks gamers fighting like toddlers over big studio cinema just isn what it used to be the movie itself is simply put pretty lame it isn outlandish enough to compete with the rest of the phase four media and it doesn even play like something out of phase 3 where things started getting ambitious and or weird with retro oddities like thor ragnarok and visual marvels like black panther give or take the odd cg rhino instead this would be at home amongst the lame contrived sequels of phase two you know back when people were excited about the idea of black widow movie ve also been told the character of taskmaster constitutes another mandarin scenario la iron man 3 also from phase two but don know enough about the original comics character to judge my mind is all watchers and time keepers at the moment you think have time to worry about some russian spies and creepy incel in sky castle dosvedanya romanoff ', ' my first bug bear is that once again there is huge reliance on the viewer to understand what is going on literally nothing is explained why is fury on space station who is monica rambeau as viewer you are on the back foot from the start if you haven seen the 20 films and 4 tv series required and it hard to catch up it feels like this film has undergone significant post production changes some of cpt marvel interactions with other characters are all over the place and they can make up their mind as to what her character is experiencing there are some good moments the action sequences when they swap places are energetic and fast paced and the short amount of time the 3 characters are on the ship together is fun iman vellani is again enthusiastic and plays the role of the audience just shame they don build strong story around her marvel needs to work on grounding some of these stories in the real world again to allow the audience to connect with the characters ', ' some sequences in this series are truly terrifying tennant portrayal of kilgrave is chilling at my age am usually blas about scare tactics and menace but he surpasses all that absolutely the best demon in human form ever say that because knew man who had such complete control over his girlfirnd at the time to the extent that even in public she would never look away from him to him was casual acquaintance and scared me but he told me that something had done with house too long story was good and that he approved was released in way from his influence it haunts me to this day of course have to say that the rest of the cast and production team are superb and fully deserve all the accolades this show can glean ', ' coming out of the gate with some of the worst reviews in franchise history went into this with tempered expectations what got was charming if unexceptional narrative nothing about the storyline is so jarringly out of place as to snap my immersion none of the comedy so corny that made me cringe in embarrassment all three women are at peak performance and have great chemistry with one another making for endearing characters so what the problem though m finding the complaints of frantic pacing to be overblown the story beats do play out one after the other giving these characters only the minimal amount of breathing room to really gel with one another the consequences of an apparent disastrous event for set of characters is barely acknowledged and the solution to their plight plight that is the catalyst to the entire movie is solved in about 45 seconds we neither see nor hear of these characters or them for the rest of the film this will become problem for the rest of the movie minor conflicts are introduced and solved so quickly they feel barely worth bringing up at all what felt should have been the emotional core of the entire story effectively solves itself in one of the least engaging ways imaginable and as before never brought up again the warmth the actresses bring to these characters and their rapport with one another make it all the more frustrating when the film barely allows them to expand on these situations in any real significant way before it time to get back to comic book movie that the biggest problem in my assessment the actors are good and their characters charming the comedy is for the most part witty and brisk there no screaming goat running gag it good enough but after decade and 33 movies is good enough good enough ', ' would imagine if you re 12 and girl you would love ms marvel unfortunately m neither so don fully appreciate it iman vellani is excellent as kamala khan ms marvel and the rest of the cast seem pretty good the script has some funny moments and the effects are decent but this is show for children it a far cry from the highs of dare devil and the punisher after the bland childish hawkeye and now series aimed at an even younger audience fear my days of looking forward to and watching marvel series is over thanks disney ', ' was certain that captain marvel was gonna be the worst movie in the series cause it couldn possibly get any worse than that but sure enough don let the title of this movie fool you cause black widow is not only side character but also caricature of her former self all done for the express purpose of pushing yelena into the spotlight for future films there is absolutely nothing in this movie that stands out or that deserves any praise the acting was atrocious par sj the writing is filled with plotholes and conveniences and the hilariously bad accents were very distracting and least forget taskmaster had any other movie done the opposite there would be absolute outrage but in this case who cares double standards amirite they could have done this so much better but no it just shallow money grab propped up on the avengers movies fame what an absolute waste ', ' came into this as marvel fan but with zero knowledge of this character watched every episode start to finish they spent lot of time effort to show off pakistani culture which sure that nice for americans to see and understand since it not well represented cool however they spent all that time effort in lieu of building characters and relationships moreover the writing was just so poorly done how did this happen how did that happen how is y possible no answers no explanation her super power of running away at regular speeds is wow so pathetic it laughable to see on screen and she gets away how the antagonist is not good actress yeesh m professionally trained and experienced actor you re not supposed to show your acting just be real in the moment every scene she in she shows her acting and isn real in the moment bad casting on this one all the other actors did either good or great job but there so little story it just wasted talent this show could have been better but they wrote it lazy and or rushed so it not what garbage show ', ' things went bit wonky with that elektra business however series 3 is stonking return to form fleshing out multiple characters on the stage with fisk retaining the title as one of the best villains brought to the small screen daredevil does remain the technically worst super hero in the business with his special abilities never being sensational and getting beaten up being his strongest however the characters and story remain grip that bit above the competition bravo binge watched ', ' had good time wasn bored once throughout the movie it made sense and it flowed the comedy relief was good as usual from marvel m not sure what people were expecting from this movie but think it was definitely worth watching in theaters ', ' the avengers is great movie but not due to its plot it a simple macguffin chase culminating in random big fight also the editing felt unfinished from time to time nevertheless it not the plot that is supposed to make the avengers great movie it the fact that it brings stories and characters from other movies together in way the avengers is the finale of bigger whole the lack of plot gives the opportunity to zoom into the different characters and how they respond to each other we learn how bruce banner and tony stark connect we see how the hulk and thor have measurement of strength how the straight morals of captain america conflicts with the happy go lucky attitude of iron man we also get closer look at shield and we learn that the agency has its moral questionabilities when we move beyond the avengers we learn how that is so in captain america the winter soldier the choice for loki to be the main villain connects to the firs avengers comic and in many other ways as well the movie pays its respect to the comics as we re used to in the marvel cinematic universe mcu the avengers movie is mile stone in the mcu and yes its greatest merit is being the avengers movie it not the plot that makes this movie great it the fact that it the pay off for earlier established characters and stories and laying the ground work for more great stuff to come ', ' if you have not followed any comics that have shown jessica jones you will be disappointed guess but to me shes one of the most real comic heroes ever her history and how she deals with things make her more down to earth then most super heroes in the shows out today not all super heroes should be all perfect and nice and good all the time and this show nailed her persona down find the sex scenes to be bit useless since they are not so short and not really showing anything then why drag them out but besides that the show has captured what always thought jessica jones would be like in real life find it funny some comments say the acting is bad compared to daredevil when felt dd actors were kind of exaggerating their roles bit too much in that show daredevil was good but would of liked to see it more real like they have done with this show cant wait to see luke cage and iron fist if they make it as good or better than jessica jones m on board 100 ', ' when first watched this show was sure as hell hooked to this show like never before got done with each season in 3 weeks this show is probably the best show out there really hope they bring this show back or m suing netflix daredevil ', ' daredevil first of all am big fan of dc characters but marvel universe is so vast and it has some of the most amazing shows on tv and daredevil for me is the best superhero show ever netflix and marvel collaborated in order to get four shows including daredevil jessica jones luke cage and iron fist and the defenders arrive this year amazing isn it daredevil starts pretty slow you will only feel so because you won have any idea whats going on for the first couple of episodes but then for the rest of the episodes you will only wonder how amazing this show is the first season is huge 10 on 10 for me but the second season is actually pretty slow but we have the punisher who will be getting his solo show which also arrives this year amongst us and that is the sole reason to binge watch it what show this is ', ' was left with the general feeling that captain marvel is major disappointment first of all there is good story here somewhere but it just not well told and there too much of it crammed within about 115 minutes the movie is fast paced but never really works because the pacing is flat and timing is off aesthetically captain marvel has been processed through the same marvel filter as the rest of them dull the filmmakers indie directors of the great half nelson have given absolutely no attention to the music the score is completely forgettable as are the 90 songs as for the themes the mgtow people are going to have field day with captain marvel less than subtle feminist agenda m putting that in quotations because it more accurately described as simply female agenda which is absolutely fine and commendable the problem is the infantile in your face way the filmmakers address the theme the movie is set in the year 1995 and it really feels made for that year audience captain marvel lacks fresh perspective and by the way any fans of buffy the vampire slayer will immediately recognise one pivotal scene lifted from truly powerful scene in the series finale in any case carol danvers of the comics was always decidedly feminist character so this shouldn cause any waves what lacking is carol wide array of problems her character history in the comics is one of the craziest in the marvel universe which is saying something movie much simpler the biggest disappointment however is the resourceful brie larson she just off don know what happened but the brilliant actress from room is nowhere to be seen she was just the wrong choice guess still m surprised by her lackluster ness the cast isn great anyways but at least samuel jackson and ben mendelsohn seem to be having fun unlike me for the most part ', ' first thing first the avengers is masterpiece period it not easy to put together the most famous marvel superheroes apart from spidey of course in single movie with good plot very good characters development good evil and make great movie like this one the story develops around the avengers project an idea by nick fury director of h e d and the superhero billionaire tony stark alias iron man group of super persons at service of mankind something like the men the villain here is loki returned from the end of the other great movie from marvel studios thor eager to take control of the earth using the powers of the tesseract the same powerful alien artifact seen in captain america there is connection with other marvel movies in fact to really appreciate the movie you should see the other two movies at least but it not priority of course the result is movie full of wonderful action sequences smart dialogs excellent character development and an open finale for another possible great adventure don worry no spoilers here just wait the end of the first part of the credits at the end of the movie pleasant surprise wonderful movie for every comic fan around the world and for the ones that hates this kind of movie just see this film and you ll be amazed trust me 10 10 teo from italy ', ' average 2nd season how something that have started so well tumbled into the abyss of mediocrity season 2 is constanlty trying ti drive really intreating character into the ground jessica is pi they should have focused on diffrent case in each episode with one main theme running through several seasons the plot is tiresome in this one watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to see ', ' what slow based incoherent mess of show found myself being more entertained by doing the laundry marvel needs to slow down and get back on track don waste your time ', ' love carol denver and her power but honestly feel like her movies are done dirty we waited 5 years for this it was so bad the whole movie feels like filler movie with literally zero significance to the whole marvel universe apart from the final scene which was also super random the acting was so bland from the two adults while kamala is actually the bright point of the movie the rest including nick fury and the antagonist are so incredibly bland and lack lusted nick was only there for comedic purposes and feel like he has lost his poignant from the previous movies the antagonist was so random and so incredibly boring don even know how she becomes the antagonist and how she could hold up fight against someone who literally flew through battleships like they were paper thin then the final battle was so anticlimatic like she took on 3 superheroes 2 of which are possibly some of the most powerful in the entire mcu like where is the logic the movie feels disconnected incredibly cheap with storylines all over the place and you just don feel connected with the characters what so ever it funny at place but 99 of the movie is just random and wasteful of the talents of the cast m glad hold off going to the cinema and wait for it to come out on disney because would never pay to go see this 2 10 ', ' the animation is ok but the dialogue is terrible by far the worst animated series based on the avengers ve ever seen you be much better off watching avengers assemble or earths mightiest heroes ', ' really don know what else to say fell asleep halfway through it was fairly boring but on the bright side my brother watched the whole thing and informed me on the way out of the mostly empty cinema that hadn missed much didn think it was worth the money wasted on it ', ' what happening netflix mean the first season was mediocre it has good moments agree and the violence moments are fine gory and bloody but honestly agree with many that the second season was stupid for me it started ok like hos the girl why shadowy people are hunting her blah blah blah but then the story like balloon it started to loose air and shrink itself to nothing and yet again why they try to make the characters so human agree that there must be drama story characters dialog blah blah blah but they loose the characters in the narrative and honsetly dont care about madani story or jigsaws honestly agree that season two from 13 episodes could be reduced to 8 6 if they cut the crap honestly said it onces and said it again tv show that found myself skipping the timer and reducing 45 60 min long chapter to only 25 30 minutes skipping the dull and boring dialogue its not cool formula for me again another wasted soon to be cancelled tv show like iron fist luke cage the defenders and now daredevil honsetly its matter of time for jessica jones too because wasnt impressed by season one and was literally bored and unimpressed by the stupid and forgettable season two if punisher gets season threee they better cut the crap and stick to the bloody comic or they will cancel it soon bye bye ', ' worse marvel movie ever as simple as that the falcon and the winter soldier miniserie worse miniserie in mcu it is connected with this movie to introduce the hawkeye miniserie thats it ', ' the movie was amazing it that simple action movies have different standard and this was great action movie the cast was genuinely fun and the movie was engaging ', ' what lifeless mess of bad russian accents and what with pugh totally annoying acting and with the choice of american pie during the early scenes realized this is not for me neither fun or interesting just waste of time ', ' depends how you wish to interpret these shorts and if you re true fanatic but if you like reminiscing or in need of recap these shorts have you covered am episode usually runs concurrently with the disney show movie that gets released this show has you covered ready ', ' its just advertisements for their films being lazy imo like filler episode with clips from previous episodes marvel just want to advertise new series forever now before releasing ', ' overall it an average movie captain marvel story is beautifully told but frankly did not see the power to defeat thanos the strongest invincible captain marvel think they haven given him that power well the enemy was obviously very bad so there was no enemy in the middle rather than bad his scores were made by pinar toprak didn see any good scores except for few tracks it could have been better scores there were logic errors they didn know how fury eye was blind but he lost his eye because of something so absurd and irrational in short did not find the movie as origin very successful 100 63 ', ' disappointing marvel the marvels movie falls flat as an avid fan of the marvel cinematic universe was eagerly anticipating the release of the marvels however after watching the movie can help but feel thoroughly disappointed it pains me to say it but the marvels fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors and falls flat in numerous areas one of the biggest issues with the film is its lackluster storytelling the plot feels convoluted and disjointed making it difficult to get invested in the narrative the movie attempts to juggle multiple storylines and characters but it fails to give each one the attention they deserve as result the pacing feels rushed and the audience is left feeling disconnected from the characters and their motivations furthermore the characterization in the marvels is missed opportunity the film introduces new characters but they lack depth and development they feel like mere placeholders with no real substance or memorable qualities even the returning characters from previous films seem to be stuck in state of stagnation with little growth or evolution one of the strengths of marvel movies has always been their ability to strike balance between action and character driven moments sadly the marvels leans heavily towards mindless action sequences at the expense of meaningful character interactions the action scenes while visually impressive lack emotional weight and become repetitive after while it feels like spectacle for the sake of spectacle without any real purpose or impact on the overall story another major disappointment is the film direction and cinematography the visual style lacks the innovation and creativity that we have come to expect from marvel films the cinematography feels uninspired with generic framing and lackluster shot compositions the director fails to create any truly memorable or visually stunning moments which is missed opportunity given the vast potential of the marvel universe furthermore the humor in the marvels falls flat marvel movies have been known for their clever and witty humor but this film attempts at comedy feel forced and contrived the jokes often miss the mark and elicit little more than polite chuckle failing to land with the impact and timing that we have come to expect overall the marvels is lackluster addition to the marvel cinematic universe its weak storytelling underdeveloped characters excessive focus on action uninspired direction and lackluster humor all contribute to disappointing movie experience as fan had hoped for so much more from this film but sadly it fails to deliver on its promises ', ' the story was well written and design every scene was exciting and enjoyable to watch although the sequence of the mcu universe well continues ', ' this is one of the marvel series that many people have been waiting for unlike the others ms marvel really describes us as viewers who really like one of the super heroes ', ' archer started slow and then built up following over 14 seasons hit monkey was fine tuned and ready to go

infinite range of grunts vengeful ghost spirit comes to life looking for the duo because the peace of tokoyo has been threatened as the viewers all of you not just me are trying to make sense of this new twist we hear the deadpan voice of jason sudeikis with perfect comic timing that even jack benny would have admired is it like comic con here all the time here or something funny designated imdb top reviewer please check out my list 167 nearly perfect movies with the occasional anime or tv miniseries you can should see again and again 1932 to the present ', ' this is very nice show action and tension scenes are very well achieved and it also has great written characters but the plot is not exciting ', ' apparently this is based on or follows on from tv show that have not seen it shows the first 30 minutes and this is not unusual for marvel movie was confusing flurry of special effects and ernest dialogue that meant very little to me then something that looked like coherent story line started to emerge then more fighting and seen it million times before and they don look that great special effects then some human nature bits then finale which as far as we could make out could have happened right at the beginning if they had thought of it and saved us all couple of hours mildly interesting twist at the end though the concept was not original don know if this got cinematic release but it feels bit straight to video or straight to streaming as it would be these days ', ' this show is worthless season 1 showed great promise season 2 showed viewers that this show didn deserve to be renewed yet netflix cancelled daredevil boycott netflix ', ' m not what you would consider an authority on the avengers but did grow up reading all the marvel comics could get my hands on eagerly watched every movie tv show cartoon starring super heroes was big fan of the old incredible hulk tv show starring bill bixby lou ferrigno read hulk thor iron man avengers comics as well would suggest before seeing the avengers seeing iron man iron man 2 the incredible hulk captain america thor it not prerequisite but it would certainly enhance your enjoyment of the movie joss whedon is one of my favorite directors writers producers buffy the vampire slayer angel firefly serenity dollhouse cabin in the woods love his sense of humor at first was disappointed that edward norton didn return for the role of bruce banner but mark ruffalo was incredible as the hulk samuel jackson brings the bad ass to the role of col nick fury of h e d robert downey jr brings his charisma to iron man again chris evans captain america chris hemsworth thor scarlett johansson black widow jeremy renner hawkeye and tom hiddleston loki all brought the magic in their roles the story and action were amazing just the right balance of eye candy character comic relief plan to see it again in the theater buy it on blu ray ve only seen handful of movies in the theater more than once so that is high praise from me eagerly await the next marvel movie ', ' super characters super atmosphere its shame that disney cancelled netflix adaptation im positive that the next daredevil series will be inferior kingpin is the most impressive in my point of view ', ' black widow serves up enough thrills action and eye popping visual effects plus bonus trio of oscar nominated female leads scarlet florence and rachel somehow it falls short of the consistency we have come to expect from an mcu production no thanks to poorly cast villain and disclosed ending e black widow demise ', ' won put any spoilers in my review but loved this movie surprisingly for person who doesn really care for action movies thought the avengers was one of my all time favorite movies it has humor but not too much and enough awesome action to live up to the enormous hype surrounding it ve notices that sometimes high budget comic book movies have good cgi but bad acting or vise versa not the case with this movie all the characters were amazing even most of the supporting cast which doesn usually happen in movie like this was sad when it ended do recommend it yes go see it if you haven already guarantee it worth it didn see it in 3d so can say how good the 3d is ', ' meh since the girls scene from endgame fighting thanos most of us knew that this intro would be inevitable and absolutely to their advantage but two series or movies won just make it fly but make the next generation confused one can tell that comic and superhero movies slash series are becoming something of the past like the scene with the phrase that went like so you walk through witches hex and it gave you super powers honestly it was laughable so until they get in touch with reality don think most of us would enjoy this genre of movie anymore we are evolving so companies with movie productions both new and old should consider this before it flops and leaves mark on such characters with potential to do more ', ' it a film of action it is very hard love this film but it is very long it lasts 2 hours and 30 minutes it was made in the usa in 2016 go to see this film with my father love seeing films with my friends or my parents the film is about the vengadores and guardians of the galaxy it is very funny the vengadores and guardians of the galaxy faith with ta os to see if the world this part is an action part my father and me love this part agree with my father the film is very cool would recommend this film because it is interesting it funny and it have lot of action my favourite person is iron man he is very cool think this film is loved everywhere in the world ', ' this is literally the worst marvel show series have ever seen should never make it to second season let alone second episode cut the form and bury this trash heap of show ', ' there are lot of babies posting about how bland this movie was and how larson is an unwatchable actress which is extremely stupid she did good job and of course samuel jackson was great can wait to see her in avengers endgame ', ' we understand why this exists it a quick recap of characters time in the mcu so new viewers can start in phase 4 and not feel lost but this could have been more better editing like stuff on youtube that really digs into the heart and soul of the character traditional clip show with the character or actor setting up clips by telling story or michael pe s luis from antman doing his voice over recaps could have mixed comic animated shows and mcu history to really dive into the lore of the characters could ve been something new and fresh but it just marketing tool for the real stuff ll still watch them as the new shows come out and hope they do better longer ones for characters who stories are more complete instead of just to hype new content ', ' she a teenage kid in show geared toward teenagers unless you have not noticed so let stay off our high horse and see where the show goes next ', ' all these negative reviews are full of it as far as m concerned just all politics it refreshing fun and interesting the lead character is played really well and like that they talk about issues within race and handle it well her mother think is played really well sometimes people seem to be so focused on what is in series or movies in connection with what going on around us in life but it a fictional series and to make it even more pointless the marvel universe is wide open due to the multiverse why people looking for actual life in fictional series that could be set in any number of universes in the multiverse very much looking forward to the next episodes already great work marvel ', ' the first three episodes of ms marvel are legitimately phenomenal with strong and likable cast some great character moments and style that sets it apart from the other mcu shows and films the final three episodes the second half of the six episode season goes off the rails though with bizarre and confusing conclusion to the villain group arc supporting character getting powers out of nowhere with zero explanation and growing number of characters suddenly brought back into the fold after being almost forgotten for several episodes there rumours that ms marvel got some serious reshoots and its clear these all happened in the second half of the season which feels like it was written by different group of people hell even the stylish on screen text in the first three eps was almost completely dropped in the back three either lack of vision or too many cooks in the kitchen ms marvel has no idea what it wants to be ', ' despite having differences with respect to the comics to begin with it fine the only negative is that it a bit slow but you have to understand that it the first chapter know it going to pick up pace ', ' finally joss whedon gets the recognition he deserves after creating some of the most compelling intelligent and entertaining tv shows of all time buffy angel firefly dollhouse he brings the same mastery of writing ensemble casts to the big screen and people see what he is capable of just give the guy blank cheque and let him write all the sci fi and fantasy he wants far from being immature entertainment his previous masterpieces all respected the intelligence of the audience and contained characters that were so likable and charismatic that it was impossible not to tune in each week here he does what he did in buffy angel and firefly but he does it with massive budget and some of the most famous superheroes in the world who else could have written and directed film starring iron man thor the hulk and captain america but doing them all justice not only that but also doing justice to nick fury hawkeye and black widow his trademark aptitude for writing strong female protagonists really came through with black widow go see it then watch all of buffy angel and firefly ', ' disney is an absolute dumster fire right now the problem here is weak script no real back story just some obsessed kid that stumbles across some powers the usual woke messaging thrown in it cheesy as hell jokes are flat the only question now is will she hulk be worse ', ' saw the avengers on may 17 personally m not much of superhero fan but quite enjoyed the movie in my opinion the avengers is pretty good and entertaining movie and it a good theatrical experience james berardinelli wrote in his review the avengers kicks ass agree over the last few years five movies have been made iron man iron man 2 thor the incredible hulk and captain america which have built up to and became prequels to the avengers there were even things in those movies that hinted at them all being connected and now this movie confirms it the avengers are all assembled in this film iron man captain america thor the hulk the black widow and hawkeye yes they re all played by the same actors and they have the backgrounds that have been established for most of them in the prequels mentioned above the villain in the movie is loki who was the villain in thor and who now plans on using the tesseract powerful energy cube to open portal to another part of the universe and attack the earth with powerful army the avengers are called together by nick fury who runs an agency called h e d and they must stop loki from carrying out his plans there more to the story but won give any more away m sure there are things that can be criticized about the movie however it really not worth it given there are so many good things about the movie and the entire experience is very enjoyable so m not going to bother with an in depth review criticism in way the film is sort of critic proof for lack of better term so here my advice don dissect or overly analyze the movie just sit back and enjoy it that not to say that it a total transformers like junk movie or anything it actually halfway decent the actors put on good performance and really bring out their characters and the interactions between the characters are good the gathering of the different superheroes is handled pretty well the story is pretty solid and it coherent and appropriately paced the visual and special effects and action scenes are great alan silvestri composed an effective score for the movie overall the movie is halfway decent it smart and it entertaining and unlike many junk films like michael bay it actually allows for sufficient blockbuster emotional involvement and it has good wise balance between story and action effects the two and half hour running length of the movie pretty much zipped by for me so while don think this movie is great it definitely entertaining and worth seeing and it a very good theater experience my rating 1 2 out of ', ' this is the most overrated movie of this year there is nothing special in the movie except few humour the story is pretty old and and we can bow for the special effect but the special effect has been wasted for such movie with no story movie such as darknight has rating of 8 9 which is worth but this movie is not worth for such ratings its childish story please give good ratings for good movies movie is worth watching once but surely this is not special movie for such hyper rating hollywood movies of recent days does not have good story but gives more importance to special effect ', ' enjoyed the first half of the movie especially the characters and their interactions the new characters this movie presents are excellent especially yelena belova and red guardian unfortunately the big climatic ending was very lucklaster disappointing and boring if you follow the marvel cinematic universe mcu this movie is must watch for the movies to follow because you get introduced to the new characters and m personally really excited to see what they do with them in the future but storywise this movie is not really interesting and it not among the best of what the mcu has to offer ', ' this is one of those movies that has both good points and bad points for starters thought iron man robert downey jr and the hulk mark ruffalo were absolutely sensational likewise most of the other characters were well played too on the flip side though the introduction of hawkeye jeremy renner was terribly planned and presented not only was the character development badly mishandled but the fact that this person got so much screen time when there were others with much better credentials just boggles the mind not only that but his costume or basic lack thereof also stuck out like sore thumb additionally although liked the cgi thought it and the non stop action were just too overwhelming even more important was the fact that there were too many characters and not enough film to go around between them this made the film look extremely uneven too many cooks do indeed spoil the soup be that as it may this movie should have been very good but in all frankness it turned out to be jumbled mess all things considered then think the really good points were dragged down by the lack of direction which resulted in very mediocre film accordingly rate it as only average ', ' this was shot from the disney perspective don really understand why it has so big rating on rotten tomatoes but it just boring and ordinary tv show that was made for kids again suites plastic parents smart friends with gadgets and same jokes waste of time ', ' to be honest don usually write reviews but felt like had for this one only watched it recently as it came to streaming but after watching it man wished had seen this in the theaters enjoyed it from beginning to end and found myself smiling throughout the entire film loved how they incorporated the family into the movie as well as was afraid they would only be small guest appearance the star of the show for me was ms marvel herself iman vellani and love her acting and character so much the others were great but she carried the movie and now has fan for life from me can wait to see where marvel takes these characters in the future especially ms marvel herself suggest you give it try as you might find yourself surprised like did great movie for the family as well ', ' captain marvel isn actually that bad as people say it is it actually pretty good brie larson is great as captain marvel and she fits the role perfectly and brie larson chemistry with samuel jackson was good as well captain marvel is also an interesting fish out of water type character the story is fine but not great the second act however was very boring but overall captain marvel is pretty solid mcu flick and it isn as bad as people say it is ', ' had the highest of expectations for this film and it over delivered would advise you watch in imax 3d it was just incredible the effects the story line the humour the whole cinema was crying with laughter at some parts the hulk is scripted better than ever finally he has been done properly banner delivers in every way as normal and he does have soft spot watched this last night and am going to go watch it again today as an add on for anyone who cant be bothered to travel to see film like this in imax you really need to make the effort you wont visit normal cinema again make sure you stay past the final credits don miss that superb ', ' after watching the first season of daredevil expected more of this quasi heroin unfortunately this series it lacks ofr drama argument or special effects the alleged super woman in comics only managed to bleed once in the nose isn stronger here and is shown as confused teenager not more stronger than sumo wrestler and very bad actress had hopes for this series but it really crap while the villain is well played it was boring and redundant whitout the magic achieved in kingping in short very very bad series abstain from see it ', ' daredevil the best product to have ever come out from marvel it has masterpiece written all over it right from the first episode with excellence in all departments ranging from screenplay casting dialogues action sequences this show deserves the perfect ending please contribute to the savedaredevil campaign and help this show end with high note ', ' fell asleep during the middle but didn care for the parts saw was curious to see what they would do with florence pugh but didn like the character at all hope they will find way to make her more interesting in the hawkeye series was not into the story or the action and ended liking this one only slightly more than my least favorite marvel film captain marvel much too formulaic ', ' marvel seem to be great at knocking out movies but tv shows no another lame effort even my kids find it dull and boring and it supposed to be aimed at young audience let this one disappear after this season and never speak of it again ', ' even tho m hardcore mcu fan since was 8 this is one of the movies that didn live up to the expectations the movie was supposed the bring closure to natasha romanoff character as black widow even tho the first half of the movie was strong it didn keep it that way till the end it should have been better they wasted such great villain those who read the comics may know the character of dreykov was plain and boring atleast after doing all this he could have been interesting don get me wrong didn wanted all powerful supervillain just wanted better villain just like zemo rest of the movie was great florence pugh yelena was on the spot david harbour also did great job playing the red guardian the movie wasn bad but could have been better ', ' my favorite ice cream is cookies and cream oreo type sometimes butter pecan is yummy with its nutty crunch or chocolatey gooey fudge mix or even an occasional vanilla soft serve in plain sugar cone hits the spot love trying all different types even if that everything bagel flavor was complete flop new flavors are new experiences so props to people who keep making up all these new tastes but it weird when the hardcore vanilla crowd feels any emotion against other flavors get they only want vanilla but going out of their way to trash mint chocolate chip screams emotional immaturity worse they want to take all other flavors off the menu and make it only vanilla weird the existence of rocky road doesn diminish vanilla support whatever flavor you like but the fact that the hardcore vanilla crowd took time to leave negative reviews is great reason we need more shows like this ', ' this show is one of those teen shows where the adult director does not understand modern childhood there are also lots of cringy scenes that wouldn have happened if the characters had half brain overall this show does not hold up to already low hype this show had ', ' ll be blunt this movie was awful love the character and feel there aren enough female superheroes and female superhero movies so was really excited for this movie however the story lacked depth it was like marvel version of fast and furious and not the good ones if you like lots of action with no thought you ll love this movie it was boring predictable and at times simply didn make any sense it almost like they wanted to rush this through because of the delay from covid19 wouldn waste my time on this and really marvel are you trying to one up c with who can make the worst movie ', ' reading the other reviews it seems everyone is quite excited about this movie let me start by saying that yes it awesome to look at it cool to have all those characters together on screen and the movie definitely doesn lack action the reason m not giving 8 stars is the story or lack thereof considering that joss whedon wrote this have to say m quite disappointed by the result the movie was predictable right from the start and in spite of the abundance of action sequences failed to really catch my attention m not saying this is waste of time but considering the majority of reviews here on imdb just wanted to add my grain of salt for those pondering what to watch this evening feel free to like pronouncing it helpful think this review if you agree ', ' ve watched about 95 of all the mcu stuff wasn that excited about this entry into the canon but after watching the first 6 episodes rate this series as the most informative and genuinely human of all it informative specifically about the history of pakistan and the culture of pakistani americans two subjects d never previously given any thought to very interesting and not what d expect from comic book show it human in that it digs deeply into family relationships in way that feels realistic and warm without being too sentimental if goal of the producers and writers was to open the minds of americans about pakistanis specifically and muslims in general believe they succeeded and hopefully the world is better place for it finally if you enjoy solid coming of age story this good choice ', ' thought this was great fun spinoff that takes the supporting mcu properties in great direction sidebar wanted moon knight to be so much better than it was but its treatment of mental illness was dated embarassment whereas ms marvel treatment of first generation families in america felt respectful and either relatable or instructive depending on how recently your family got to america from somewhere else the relationship between historical colonialism and modern immigration was presented in subtle yet clear way as were the intercultural and identity challenges this was clever and thoughtful adaptation into completely different context think some fans are carrying their detailed exegisis too far into the speculative possibilities that come from microscopic examination of subtle details and forgetting that this is tv show about kid who has trouble fitting in and then gets superpowers by that measure it a great success ', ' ve been big marvel fan my entire life and this show was huge disappointment by far the worst thing marvel has ever put out was constantly cringing through every episode that forced myself to watch just so stayed up with what was going on in the mcu the cgi acting character development story telling antagonists and pretty much everything else was honestly just horrible don waste your time wish hadn ', ' slow childish complete disappointment they are all so bad at pretending to support all the minor communities target audience is less than 10 yo girls not suitable for me or my family miss the old marvel hope that the next series would be more like the gold daredevil and punisher ', ' black widow avenger natasha romanoff aka the black widow gets her very own stand alone movie whilst it took while for this movie to come to fruition can say it was entirely worth the wait the plot is banal and forgettable relying on the crashy smashy action scenes to hold the audiences attention just like logan backstory was teased in the men franchise scarlett johansson black widow had past that was touched upon in the avengers movies her scene with captured loki in avengers assemble was most intriguing and begged for spin off film to explore romanoff past like the wolverine solo outing black widow doesn deliver no where nearly as bad as the men origins movie but still flawed piece of story telling and missed opportunity black widow is entertaining and offers some excellent performances by the cast involved except perhaps ray winstone who russian accent drops in and out more often than dodgy wi fi connection set pieces are grand as you expect in marvel movie but the end product lacks venom and don mean the marvel character played by tom hardy there no depth to this movie unlike logan the redeeming wolverine movie black widow is all polish and garnish there some nice character interaction the family scenes are comical and well played out but constantly got the sense that all this had been done before in better movies the car chase scene was lifted straight from mission impossible the prison break reminded me of deadpool 2 and the falling fortress in the sky was done better in the captain america sequel even the fight choreography had whiffs of john wick and jason bourne that said for all this films flaws was still immensely entertained whilst won be rushing to shell out for the 4k blu ray will once again indulge when the movie becomes available for free as part of my subscription on disney plus ', ' what happened to marvel have been fan of marvel movies since my childhood and couldn beleive what m seeing now what kind of characterization is this why kamala khan why and reallly don understand the fact where you re leading this phase four to just be the way you used to don try anything like this and disappoint us the downfall has started from the eternals good characterization but what the hell is the story and next quantamania and now marvels you could ve just done marvel the way you used to marvel please stop disappointing us please ', ' the avengers movie don really know what to expect massive disasters huge rescue team at first don really like the team up of thor captain america iron man hulk hawkeye and black widow in squad against the naughty god of loki it is very true for fictional movie to be irrational and illogical in some part of it but the combination itself seemed weird especially they came from very different time and dimensions though it was explained very briefly in the movie still can find it successful to convince me with it quite excited with the first 60minutes when the team was built up again with all conflicts and funny stuffs thanks to mr tony stark robert downey jr for his sense of humor actions were of course as expected you could never get enough of it though might afraid you gonna find it somehow too easy somehow some part of it my favorite character certainly goes to miss natasha romanoff scarlett johansson with her witty techniques of interrogation the cast was used very wisely they played very beautiful role in this movie storyline of every superheroes movie wasn really worth discuss for good versus evil justice win over the bad guy plan and etc two things like the most are the enough time 141minutes with no boredom and when the teammates were scattered all around but don really think when the superhero music played and they assembled with capt steve rogers took the lead was the climax that we really wanted to watch old fashioned and too usual and believe the ending wasn that satisfying too it was very entertaining though worth every penny and don know may be it still one of the best movie in this year should get almost 5 almost ', ' so much wrong no plot to speak of hackneyed unbelievable situations and dialogue wig that survives all manner of extreme wall smashing combat and 10 story fall glamour jessica with never smudge make up enough whipsawing love you hate you to give viewer emotional whiplash gave it every chance could but when one character was choking another and our jessica yells you re choking her that was when it all just fell apart half expected the other actors to roll their eyes at her an epiphany of awfulness and will not dignify the ferris wheel scene with comment enough give the actors credit they gave everything and did what they could with dreadful script would love to see professionally written and directed season 3 to set things right but don have faith too bad season 1 was an epiphany of extraordinariness the best season 3 could probably hope for is mediocrity ', ' overall really liked the series but there are some characters that are annoying trish is just ugh but it a fact of life that there are people in the world who make poor decision after poor decision there are some episodes that are best watched while multitasking but overall it one of the marvel series that liked the best ', ' liked captain marvel movie the negative ratings were not because of the movie itself nor the characters it was because of actress and her interviews just found out why when asked my brazilian friends about the movie they liked it and didn mention the lead actress don like gossip so generally don like to see the personal lives of actors people don hate captain marvel or carol danvers too bad she exaggerated because the movie was very good sincerely hope for sequel to captain marvel ', ' so this show is getting lot of unfounded hate for lot of silly reasons it also getting lot of unworthy praise for lot of silly reasons it seems lot of people are giving it 1 to balance out all the silly 10 and lot of people are giving it 10 to try to balance out all the silly 1 this isn your typical marvel show it is most certainly targeted towards younger pre teen audiences think as an older guy it just doesn appeal to me and that ok it not supposed to appeal to everyone ll keep watching it because love marvel and understand not everything they put out is supposed to appeal to me the actress who plays the lead does great job for the direction they were going with for this show and the supporting cast is also great my primary and biggest complaint is just how childish and borderline cringey this show is feel like you can have coming of age tale without going off the deep end with the kids stuff at least have some themes and things that appeal to adults as well this show has very few to none of those it seems targeted at very narrow audience being kids age 7 13 it just reminds me of kids shows on nickelodeon and m used to marvel having slightly higher standard than that the undertones of the show just feel like nothing marvel has ever done and for me personally it a huge miss though not bad enough to warrant all the hate and 1 ratings that it been getting ', ' so scarlett johannsen was in the first black widow and needed to be in the second one but she couldn so why did they not cast asaante wright literal lookalike to play him can even watch the movie ', ' this show could have been something great but it just feels like it trying to push religion and the history of india down our throats there is very little action and what little there is isn great ', ' marvel movies have now become the new soap operas the plot is basically as interesting as any soap opera any dim witted 1950 tv writer would have come up with sure you got your gadgets and your weapons and your sexy female assassins devoid of reproductive organs and your moronically impossible weapons such as the retractable katana that the main foe manages to get out of her ass sorry rucksack and your amazingly impossible fight stunts but in the end the meat of the script is that stupid pathos that fails to be anything more than carbon copy of 1950 all american bs soap operas nothing new nothing old as well they managed to botch every single detail of that 1995 flashback writers who weren even born at that time think that back then it would be perfectly fine for 12 year old girl in ohio would have blue hair or run around in mountain bike guess this is new trend in film making rewriting the 80s and 90s as you would like them to have been bottom line this is fun action movie with all the fantasy you have come to expect from marvel plus some over the top ridiculousness that actually made me laugh to tears because of how outrageously ridiculous these stunts were big thumbs up goes to pugh undoubtedly the best thing this movie has to offer she outshines johansen and rachel weisz who imho is an absolute goddess of the silver screen watch out for her something tells me she gonna be huge star if she keeps it up ', ' the marvels is the sequel to captain marvel this sequel is in depth and written in part by nia dacosta director of little woods and the 2021 candyman sequel after captain marvel brie larson final actions with the kree empire the tyrannical kree dar benn zawe ashton tries in her own way to return the kree empire to its former glory these actions put other worlds at risk captain marvel tries to stop dar benn only to find her powers tangled with those of monica rambeau teyonah parris and kamala khan iman vellani when one of them uses their powers they switch positions with each other the three must work together during this force entanglement to stop dar benn this new film from the marvel film series actually comes with some housework for the viewers to clearly understand everything in this film she actually expects you to be familiar with the first captain marvel film and the marvel disney series wandavision and ms marvel without this knowledge there is chance that you will not be able to clearly understand everything that exactly happened in this movie lack of this information can only make this film seem more obscure furthermore the film sometimes seems bit rushed and scattered this could also be because the three writers of the film are not yet at the beginning side for nia dacosta this is only her third writing effort the other two writers have only written stories from tv series although some of this series are also part of marvel this unfortunately did not provide much further experience when the characters use their powers and move places it only makes the events in the beginning of the film even more unclear especially when they don seem to change places every time they use their powers something that isn really explained in detail in the film the changing of superpowers is also something that has been used before in superhero films such as in fantastic 4 rise of the silver surfer even though this film had its limited aspects she still managed to turn it into something comical every now and then due to the rushed pace and small aspects of this film there seems to have been little room for some light moments of comedy the young iman vellani knows how to provide some cheerful moments but unfortunately this is quickly overshadowed by the more serious tone of the rest of the film and her co stars brie larson and teyonah parris play characters who have history with each other but in this film they are given little time and opportunities to do something with it this is samuel jackson 15th marvel film project but he doesn get many opportunities to do anything special in this film and has just some room for light comedy moments zawe ashton also plays more of standard villain which you as viewer don really care about due to the rushed aspects behind the film the visual effects do not always appear convincing when green screen or further cgi is used this is unfortunately visible the visibility of this visual effects word sometimes even takes you out of the story ', ' they literally made marvel movie with 3 characters nobody cares about no wonder this ended up being the lowest performing movie at the box office in the history of the mcu this movie was pushed back multiple times and got delayed from being released several times and now we can see why the plot for this film was weird sloppy nonsensical the action scenes were even worse and almost all the actors are phoning it in with the exception of iman vellani who plays ms marvel she the only character who has any personality whatsoever in this film but she not enough of reason to go see this film in theaters do yourself favor just watch this on disney in couple months this film is not worth the cost of movie ticket ', ' once in while tend to go to my local theater to check out something new maybe new release or re run of movie today stumbled upon the marvels thought hey haven been going to the theater this month that often maybe should try this out and well it seems that d made the wrong decision the marvels follows the titular marvels trying to stop an evil kree with one disadvantage however every time they use their powers it freaky friday maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies its like adhd experience the movie does not take itself seriously at all and as result it makes me hard to care for literally everything its like circus act masquerading as movie it doesn work there were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get to add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of nick fury who feels like completely different character altogether cracking lame after lame jokes every single time special effects were decent but considering the massive 271m budget wished they could ve at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene it gets tiring after while you know brie larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie her character also being this girl boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities it all feels so one dimensional it tries to be like 80s action star with the likes of arnold and co but fails because they lack charisma and charm because of this found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way monica rambeau wasn trying her best here and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where found her virtually indistinguishable from mrs danvers herself however do commend iman vellani kamala khan whose child like personality was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is copy and paste from dozens we ve seen before overall messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes it certainly feels like homework for the mcu as it struggles to keep hook in something after the infinity saga skip this one and play with your action figures instead im sure it ll be better than this ', ' m glad they made this movie pros great casting especially florence pugh top notch action cool bad guy cons kinda under developed in parts some parts of the movie just come off little cheap ', ' if the universe give you chance to be superhero be black widow instead of wonder woman must watch family focused super action movie ', ' everything which came after was big mess too long too boring the show just wanted to be political correct and couldnt manage to have proper villain just stop watching after season 1 ', ' we love marvel movies and have seen them all and this was the worst one ever too much talking and backstory and not enough action few action sequences were not enough to save it it was real disappointment to us to the point that we considered leaving the theater ', ' not as good as most of marvel other films such shame ', ' watched this because grew up reading marvel comics ve loved the big screen marvel movies and really like josh whedon past work including the avengers that being said while literally opening with bang the show wasn everything hoped for yet it shows the potential for more much more its unfair to expect everything to be perfect in opening show for series and suspect this show will only get better week by week the show introduces us to mostly new characters and there is obviously room to add more along with some familiar faces as the series evolves there enough action but not too much and enough violence without going over the top with excessive blood and gore is it safe for kids well if you let them read the comics then d say absolutely there nothing here they haven seen in the comics in terms of graphic violence is it fun for adults if you like the marvel movies then m pretty sure you ll enjoy this series can imagine josh whedon letting us down ', ' no this is the worst marvel movies created so far yo director there are more to film other than her bottom you know but in lack of story we film some behinds to get some male audience if the sound track didn include some of the marvel theme song wouldn know that this is marvel movie can understand why scarlett johansson sued them ', ' this show is just example badly and silly and direction ms marvel origin story from comic was written too cringing so there is nothing much to talk about or need expectations why this show that bad let jump out of topic yesterday was checking ms marvel rating every reviewing site 1 late night and 2 before daybreak first was very very popular site at night ms marvel rating was about to 50 so ib check reviews but few hours later ms marvel have 85 rating and not even single new review 2nd site was same but most positive reviews ever seen on this planet everyone was thanking the director and main lead for blessed the human kind with this heavenly touch gift that the universe will try to steal it from us if you not believe please visit that site and dive into pool of sweetness 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th all site was like this is the best show made in history but got imdb full respect from now on imdb still havel 6 2 rating meanwhile rest of reviewing site worshipped disney basement ', ' oh ms marvel when the show first aired watched about 10 minutes before turning it off at face value this series was too juvenile and cringey for me to get into in preparation for the marvels figured that ms marvel was necessary viewing on my second attempt liked this series much more than thought would the dive into pakistani culture was fascinating iman vellani kamala was fairly likable and some of the action sequences without cgi were good the series specifically the pilot was uniquely shot and made for some fascinating storytelling elements trust between characters in this series is like yo yo one second someone is evil and the next second they re good and then evil again had difficult time following the motivations of the antagonists and didn really care about the final episode necessary viewing but not one that care to revisit anytime soon best character aamir best quote good isn a thing you are it a thing you do best scene aisha home best piece of score on lamp post ', ' apart from few amusing bits here and there not one of them involving the star of the movie this was very stale popcorn flick with mediocre story and an underlining agenda showed in there in such heavy handed way that an illiterate butcher with raging autism would have managed to create subtler way of telling story about certain hollywood creep that everybody knew about for decades and did nothing until it was beneficial for select few but hey you can spell hollywood without ypocrisy scarjo just keep saying what they tell you to like good little parrot and use those fading looks for as long as you can because after that millions you get paid now will be fading dream for mediocre actress that literally built her career on crumbling foundations her beauty they subverted our expectations alright was expecting decent summer movie nothing groundbreaking but simply fun to watch instead what we got here is too little and way way too ng late yeah mcu at this point is deader than hollywood creativity ', ' after seeing what the writers did with rosario in iron fist am hesitant to keep watching hopefully these 8 episodes will go by quick or maybe the writers listened to the fans and dialed her character back few notches ', ' was aware of the power change and even though m not huge in the comics was very impressed by this episode applaud the large amount of plot and exposition given to the character that didn feel rushed or over bearing iman vellani is great and really comes across as the super hero nerd pre teen m familiar with the entire center family unit is great the dad shines and is very believable as father the brother is good and the mom is doing great job and m excited to see her and khamala relationship going forward ', ' the writing style is just boring don k ow who this show is for it is childish at times and at points it makes no sense there is no connection to the greater marvel universe and the gushing of mediocre character captain marvel is just blah ', ' it awful although the portrayal isn as bad as previous portrayals in squareenix avengers or marvel ultimate alliance it still unbelievable that any rational person let alone teenager would be fan of captain marvel especially the one played by brie larson but so far in the mcu it doesn matter who plays captain marvel she is just such an unlikeable character marvel would be better off if they quit pushing the all new all woke characters and stories that no one likes and go back to basics ', ' just saw the trailer of season 2 after that watched the trailer of season 1 again well changed my rating from 9 to 10 yeah things can be better of course but if you look at the complete package ambiance and look feel of the series just love it beats all other marvel series easily ', ' the story is the lamest of all marvel movies nothing makes sense waste of time even forgot most of the movies after just 1 day ', ' nice tv show have some pretty short episode about some characters or objects and see some strong moments seen in others movies very good to see again some moments and to see the characters ', ' simply don waste time on this whatever it is it is so lame and senseless that you will regret spending time on something like this just have one question why marvel disney just why ', ' it will suffice to say that am longing for what coming up in the mcu just so that can partially make up for the time spent watching black widow was disappointed to say the least and to think that we all been waiting for it for over year due to coronavirus pity on the bright side have to admit that the opening scene is jaw dropping as well as the use of natasha manipulation skills ', ' so very boring its not just the lack of action the writing is terrible this has easily been the worst of all mcu projects so far the star is good young actress but that where the positives of the show end it a hard watch ', ' let me say season 1 was exciting it was great never thought the acting was great but the plot action and scenery made it watchable season 2 well let just say the same thing that ruined iron fist and daredevil showed it ugly head feminism the main focus was the women which wouldn be bad thing if was actually supposed to be about them but it isn they ruined another great marvel character to satisfy politics disgraceful ', ' okay will from my side am pakistan and say it disappointing to see the people think about us like that we are work in another countries and usually we work in technology companies how we work in technology and don know camera ', ' actually downloaded imdb to leave review because this was that bad had to ve never actually felt annoyed at film until now this was horrific absolutely terrible and cringe from the start to the end the film is all over the place with no direct understanding of what happening nor the point the last time seen something this bad was she hulk disney have truly destroyed what was once great and enjoyable genre of films being marvel honestly don think we ll ever see the golden superhero days again as long as disney have control over the narrative remember time when couldn contain my excitement even when d see trailer released would pick apart the trailers for easter eggs and after d watched the film myself and almost everybody knew would talk for weeks about it god miss that ', ' my wife and saw the film and be both have the same review movie was fine it was just movie it was not bad it was entertaining for sure but definitely not great with that being said we feel this film was for sure the worst marvel film yet but only because mcu films are typically great or incredibly great and this movie was neither so by default it was the worst one best we can come up with is that captain marvel was like an episode of agents of shield with slightly better cgi ', ' was not prepared to sit and watch past the first five minutes with all the jerky shakycam going on gave me headache trying to watch it it seems all you need these days to make movie just shake the camera for couple of hours not ', ' the avengers falls nowhere short of delivering fiery and action packed roller coaster ride of explosions the movie spends its time passing on the spotlight to each avenger showing off his or her unique ways of dominating enemies and overcoming hazardous obstacles seeing all of our favorite superheroes unite under one common enemy is an exciting thought and was inevitable from one day working its way into movie having an army of superheroes to save the world from utter destruction isn always bad thing but for film sometimes less is more while the avengers offers many good fighting scenes special effects and cool futuristic gadgets that make your head spin the fundamentals of good film are simply lacking the main problem with this movie is it plethoric cast of superheroes there are way too many to center on at once as hinted earlier the movie focuses too much on showing off each character one at time constantly switching the audience support from one to another throughout the movie there is constant struggle for dominance between each avenger that involves boasting smack talk bouts and interferences pretty soon the audience is divided up rooting for their favorite hero and the whole idea of the main villain is dropped completely the story is simple and clear kill loki scene after scene however that mission is forgotten by two or more of the avengers trying to display their macho ness to one another unlike many great movies this plot line is drastically linear and bare to the bones in meaning in the midst of the film thought was watching an intense wwa match from the future six superheroes is just too many for one movie the filmmakers did good job focusing on each hero but that is all they had time for can help but think if they only had two maybe three main heroes they would have had enough time to develop more interesting and meaningful plot decades ago we saw for the first time great and innovative movies like star wars terminator 1 and 2 platoon alien and just last decade the dark knight all of these films were able to focus on several main characters villains and storyline that were all intricately tied together and saturated with meaningful and thought provoking ideas in light of the avengers wide and warmly welcomed reception it seems that the standards and expectations for good films has switched to more dry and corny interpretation all the avengers truly has to offer is wild action scenes interpersonal conflict and imaginative applications of special effects these assets however are known for never having the capability of elongating films success and keeping it in the fond memories of its viewers movies like star wars which originated in the 70 lacked horribly in intense action and animation but the qualities of good story and its creativity keeps it so popular to this day other examples of movies that only glimmered for their achievements in animation are ones like avatar which was quickly forgotten because it lacked fundamentally solid story to remember the avengers is merely eye candy that satisfies marvel fans and audiences seeking captivating fight scenes it is more appropriate to label this work collection battle animated scenes rather than an actual movie ', ' now after watching episode 4 get why people like me are rating this 10 10 it gets better and better each week and can wait until the denouement whenever that going to happen ', ' the avengers was kind of ground breaking for its time it was the first time all these heroes were brought together and joss whedon pulled it off beautifully the cast is great and they work together wonderfully the action is great and the final act is amazing the villain loki is great even though his plan is one of the take over the world plans the first bit of the film is slower paced but thought that it worked well this was great movie 9 2 10 ', ' this is my first review and m really surprised anyone would give this season anything over 5 because it poor almost pointless and it drags on marvel should consider cancelling these shows or getting better writers ', ' this was awesome am astounded really goooood comics interpretations its worth your time ', ' la ho iniziata guardare solamente perch sapevo che raccontava di the punisher primi episodi erano carini ma poi ti annoi vedendo che un cieco ci vede meglio di te di altri 10 messi insieme attore volte non riesce fare al meglio la parte del cieco ', ' do you enjoy watching movie in which the main character has the same facial expression throughout the entire movie if yes then this movie is made for you otherwise stay away from this horrific movie the excuse is they rushed this for endgame but still couldn have worse job there isn a single enemy or moment in the movie where you feel that the hero is in any danger the origins of her powers still make absolutely no sense and this movie answers no questions and just tells you that this happened and accept it without any background ve honestly never been so bored at cinema in my entire life d give it 3 stars but the acting drags it down to 1 ', ' sure it is not the best thing ever but after secret invasion wanted to watch something bit more cheerful and ms marvel definitely delivered although the story is not so original and think it focuses bit too much on history events the main cast is very likeable and ms marvel persona is joy to watch with marvels coming out think if you are an mcu fan you should watch this when it came out was not interested figured it would not be for 32 year old caucasian male but it really put me in good mood next will try to check out she hulk but feel like will really have to go in with open mind to that one ', ' an amiable way to while away how long was it found it less engaging than either iron man 1 or thor and whilst the dialogue interludes were welcome relief from all that crashing and banging they didn really go anywhere to help create believable characters not the point perhaps you can create belief in demi gods and superheroes who are to all intents and purposes indestructible by endowing them with mortal failings like arrogance brotherly love rage patriotism and desire to set the record straight on the plus side mark ruffalo hulk stupendous effects undermined by their ruthless efficiency they re not special anymore and couple of good belly laughs scarlett johansson in leather ', ' to sum up it was such waste of time the story is slow confusing and barely about black widow the action scenes are ridiculous humour is bad and why does it have to be feminist movie everytime that the hero is woman women saving women ', ' this is great show that both us and our 6 year old is able to enjoy together the direction camera work and the actors are all great the balance between immigrant pakistani desi brown culture plus west is great loved the parents dialogue especially when they are cursing at the instructor in urdu great start ', ' pretty mediocre marvel film however pretty female lead superhero movie in general solid story well acted isn a must see though to understand the other marvel movies ', ' you won regret spending few bucks for this movie quite enjoyable action story enough to keep you engaged yeah what else would you expect enjoyed it 7 10 ', ' poor screenplay poor story line poor casting poor acting poor directing especially the leading actress and story line that the most horribly terrible fast forward till the end hero drama ve ever seen ok 7 lines left have to say something more let talk about directing how come director made jessica jones cheesy tacky arrogant character and other characters suck too they were just acting not into the characters at all can imagine my dearest favorite daredevil will join jessica jones in the defender it will be disaster and destroy all my affection to daredevil ', ' it to childish and tries to hard to be inclusive but it just comes of as stereotypical the way her parents speak almost offensive m sure kids would like it thought but find it hard for anyone over 13 to enjoy it ', ' jessica jones is the first marvel series have ever seen was not big fan from marvel before even if liked the avengers but was never deeper into the marvel universe what will definitely change because of jessica jones started to watch the series in the middle and was captured immediately the story is exciting like the feel of the series the city the darkness and the ever present heaviness of the characters it makes you feel that you are in the middle of the series jessica jones has big trauma and you can practically feel her trauma and get to know her as you watch the series and time passes sympathized so much with her that build some kind of weird relationship to her she is perfectly imperfect and she proves it throughout the whole season the other characters are also very interesting everyone has its own individual style what differs them from each other but everybody has this certain heaviness that lies on them it just seems that everybody is down in this hell of city the villain kilgrave omg this guy has the best superpower have ever seen in my life after jessica jones liked him the most in strange way too even if he is piece of it somehow could identify with certain parts of his character and his sick humour the result of his sick being was just hilarious even if the whole first season which would rate about 9 was good the overall rating goes down to 7 the reason for that is the ending or the last three episodes which were boring as hell expected way more at the end but it was over just like that nothing special hope season 2 will come out would like to watch it and am excited about it jessica jones interested me so much in marvel that watched deadpool too which think was fantastic and now will watch daredevil on netflix people say that daredevil is way better and am looking forward to blown mind ', ' all of the dialogue seems to come straight from daytime television literally all of it is so over dramatic and clich who writes this crap the whole show people are explaining the stupidest details like it so important rule number one with writing show the story don tell it fire the writers and maybe this show could be good have to wonder if the over dramatic bad writing leads to the overacting or if it the other way around m guessing it just two wrongs don make right kind of situation ', ' this is the series that makes everyone want to watch more waiting in anticipation for the next heart stopping moment there is no better show to captivate your attention want another season ', ' so much to celebrate here being pakistani and marvel fan it such an awesome representation of our culture and story visually it was so great and overall great performances make episode one so loving cute am excited for the future and connection with other marvel heroes the story revolves around her family issues and it gives such an honest perspective to the character eman villani presence on screen is rock hard and he feels so comfortable the use of animation throughout the show looks so cool and unique it doesn go with typical teen shows which is an amazing thing this unique storytelling and inclusion of pakistan and muslim culture is marvel ous and am so thankful to disney and marvel for making this reality am feeling bad for negative review bombs from some people just because of some grudges of nation one should not just do this for the sake of fun ', ' could go on all day from how it fails at being good show to fill in the niche group of marvel fans but ll just sum it up with one plot point the main love interest turned out to be her cousin ', ' really don understand why they didn make this movie years ago in phase 1 honestly loved it loved having scarlett as the main character and florence rachel and david did great job supporting the storyline was simple but effective and there some great fight scenes some youtube reviews had seen weren a fan of the movie but honestly don know what they were expecting it was fun full of action good acting and didn overdo it pity there won be anymore scarlett as black widow as would be happy to see sequel hoping not what they ended it with though that is one movie wouldn watch don overdo it marvel you are pushing things too far ', ' did not find it quite interesting though really wanted to like it lead actress is good though action scenes are okey not comparable to other marvel series ', ' thought this was pretty good enjoyed natasha back story as well as the action which wasn overblown it felt that the characters gelled well and you cared about them at times it felt like bit of bond movie but that no bad thing ', ' until daredevil came out thought was done with superheroes couldn stand those horribly mediocre hollywood films which nowadays are based only on visuals and 3d so that the it completely different if you go to the cinema types of people would be happy not to mention arrow and other similar series where everyone sooner or later becomes some kind of superhero and completely stereotypical character to me daredevil was the turning point it all started this whole deviation from these typical patterns according to which it seems like every superhero film tv show is being made of and jessica jones just brought to whole new level what daredevil started there is saying that everything has been done before and if you are watching tv shows on daily basis you will probably have hard time not believing it but jessica jones proved me wrong and can easily say that this adult marvel universe is one of the best things that could happen not only to superhero genre but to tv shows in general ', ' very bad script first of all there are sooooo many characters that can hardly see natasha what the hell is wrong with you people lot of cgi which sucks unrealistic fight scenes in the middle of the town where pedestrians are not reacting really not to mention the fake russian accent of the actors thank god didn have to pay to see such bad movie you failed ', ' started strong but dropped the ball by the end which is an unfortunate trend with these marvel shows but it really sucks more for this one because the first 3 episodes are honestly some of the best mcu content we have gotten in couple years but unfortunately episodes 4 5 and the first half of 6 exist that sour everything iman vellani is one of the best mcu characters now because the whole show does do great job at fleshing her character out along with vellani amazing performance this show really shines bright when it showing us small character moments which is what episodes 1 3 and the second half of 6 were mostly focusing on knowing that she is gonna be in the marvels next year is the only reason really have any interest in that movie the rest of the cast and characters that aren the villains are all pretty great and their interactions are great the editing and filmmaking of episodes 1 3 is great as well this show started out feeling like it had style to it episodes 4 6 get rid of that style and lot of those great character interactions though it honestly feels like this show was made by two different people 1 3 feels like it made by passionate filmmakers while 4 the first half of 6 feels like it made by committee the villains here are garbage they aren memorable their plan and background are incredibly confusing and nonsensical and they don make any major impact on the show and are mostly written out by the end of episode 5 the action here is also not very good either it way too choppy and doesn let anyone have good sense of what is actually going on in the fight the actual story of the series itself isn amazing either did say it started out strong but it kind of got muddled and confused by the end if these characters and episodes 1 3 weren so good then this show would honestly be one of the weakest marvel shows but as of now it one of the better ones if you want to see some interesting and very likable new characters then definitely check this out but don expect anything else in the show to be as good ', ' as title say as marvel fan this is worse than venom character not move haha venom is better than black widow movie as movie this is like waste of time and they didn did perfect job sorry it could be better ', ' watched black widow the film features scarlett johansson jojo rabbit as natasha romanoff black widow anthony florence pugh midsommer as yelena belova david harbour stranger things as alexei shostakov red guardian rachel wiesz the mummy as melina vostokoff william hurt delivery man as thaddeus ross and ray winston the as dreykov watched black widow really enjoyed also florence pugh yelena belova is breakout character its not mission impossible but it did in pinch also marvel is officially back sorry wandavision mcu film will be superior to tv direction from cate shortland lore no mission impossible but the mcu is officially back 9 10 ', ' it a shame you people are review bombing this accurate and fun series it so accurate the music choice is fantastic and the visuals are so good 10 10 is reply to all the hatters how can someone be that illiterate review bombing series just because it based on pakistani female what the hell ', ' one of the best shows ve ever seen the acting the storylines the fight scenes everything about daredevil is brilliant charlie cox is fantastic as matt murdock highly recommended ', ' it not terrible movie nothing new at all nothing that hasn been done before salt bourne that boring russian ballerina movie with the hunter birds girl luc bessons movies unfortunately the directing is very poor too the editing is terrible can blame the director of course coz don know how much freedom she was given monkey can direct marvel movie and the masses will go watch it ', ' have so far liked all the marvel series on disney from wanda until this utterly boring was looking forward to this show and kept on watching hoping it would get better but no maybe it should have been on disney junior certainly not on disney plus ', ' 8 7 really and got nonsense is 9 4 seriously dark beautiful tremendous fantastic and the only marvelous thing about marvel mcu ', ' was not expecting too much from this movie but was pleasantly surprised by how this movie turned out after all this wait was very satisfied by how good this movie was it was more dark and gritty than thought the action scenes were badass and the character development for most of the characters were lot better than thought overall it was worth the wait and loved this movie ', ' on the plus side this first episode has some very interesting camera work stylish snappy dialog and scott pilgrim esque animated reality on the not so plus side the episode lacked strong plot pacing and most importantly villain we spend this episode in origin discovery mode seeing how kamala khan gets her powers the process here is different from the comic books and it involves an outing to the local avenger convention where things get bit cheesy and cringey the old green lantern film came to mind here most of the remaining episode is mild family drama that gets in the way of kamala plans it no substitute for strong plot with an actual villain we ended up somewhat bored due to the slow pace also as other reviewers have noted the episode seemed aimed at the 7 to 10 year old crowd ', ' agents of shield was such great show if you can get past the first season which was by far the worst season guarantee that you will enjoy the rest it just took while to gets it footing but once it did it was one of the best shows on tv it one of the rare shows where every season just gets better and better already miss it ', ' this film has everything you want in team up super hero film from grear action to great characters the fight choreography was great not because of john wick level action sequences but just really fun and enjoyable action scemes that really embrace comic book fun the villain loki is perfect as although he may have generic motavation the way clashes with the heroes ideologies and has huge amounts of personality made him unforgettable one of my favourite things about this movie is the sense of urgency and dread it really does feel like anything could happen and some thing could go wrong and this is due to some great writing and acting another thing love is that the characters work so well with each oher and are handled so well the best avengers not in power but in character complexity are all focused on more than the more boring characters which is awesome as it feels no potential was lost in the characters and it shows they actually put thought into there characters overall this movie still holds up as one of the best and most unforgettable mcu experiences but was still dissapionting in some avengers was huge moment for superhero films when it released back in 2012 culmination of 4 years worth of individual superhero films featuring iron man twice thor captain america and hulk remember the hype surrounding it there was no way this film could live up to fan expectations thought but was wrong in some ways it a love letter to marvel fans filled with easter eggs humourous observations and more displays of super powers than you can shake mjolnir at but it also simple yet effective in plot continuation of every individual marvel film to date as of 2012 and it works it easy to follow but not only that you can sort of start watching at any point and still be able to enjoy it there are number of great scenes and first time character interactions and loved the strained dynamics when the actual battle of new york starts the action ramps up further and it still contains some of the most fun moments of the entire mcu even though the world is at stake it never really feels like it because it localised in new york but it also not an emotionally heavy film it just lot of fun for the majority from beginning to end with so much going on at once though the action can get repetitive and therefore drag creating occasional boring bits the film does great job of showcasing each heroes individual abilities by putting them in various situations in which they excell but it also does great job of not making one hero appear drastically stronger than the rest captain america may not physically be able to compete with the bigger boys of the team even with his super soldier enhancements but he has excellent fighting skills is great strategist and has shield that can be broken which also happens to be symbol of hope for many iron man has arguably the largest arsenal of offensive weaponry but only when wearing his suit the hulk is arguably the strongest and most durable but also unpredictable and lacks intelligence thor is naturally the strongest of all and has the ability to control lightening through his magical hammer but he also arrogant ignorant and rash in his decision making not to mention he can also be easy to trick hawkeye is good fighter but not on the same level as cap or black widow he also doesn have any physical advantages but he is deadly accurate with his bow and various arrows and can cause lot of havoc from distance black widow has no physical enhancements either but her fighting skills are arguably the best in the team even compared to captain america she extremely proficient with hand guns and brilliant actor enabling her to be the perfect undercover agent love this film as lazy afternoon watch it has humour plenty of action great special effects fitting score and easy to follow it has some slow spots but it the most fun feeling of all the avengers films it doesn have this dark overtone the others contain it also an easy watch because you don need to pay too much attention to everything highly reccomended ', ' luckily m not fanboy or gamergate hater just movie buff good flick good story not great but had you laughing and rooting for carol so go see it and love that cat ', ' looks like another parallel universe version of the avengers in the original comic hulk was on rampage and they got together to stop him in this version they got together to stop loki so truly all star cast assembled to make this much anticipated movie like the fact that all the actors really look their part except nick fury he kept reminding me of all things the red skull it difficult to come up with an enemy that big enough to warrant an avengers assemble joss whedon was the first director to successfully direct the motion of the hulk hulk looked most realistic in this movie he also must have been long time marvel comic fan because all the other characters best moves were captured in this movie liked captain america in this movie lot more than the captain america movie knew that he would shine much more in contemporary surroundings looking forward for part 2 ', ' best superhero tv show ever we should make petition for letting out hearts open for this graceful journey for fourth season in our lives ', ' when you think about iron man you think about the suit of armor when you think about spider man you think about wallcrawling and swinging on webs when you think about ms marvel you think about her able to stretch and morph her body unfortunately marvel has made the decision to throw all of that out the window and made her into green lantern copy they made this decision because they didn want her to have the same powers as mr fantastic because clearly we can have two people in the same universe with similar powers this highly frustrates me because ve seen the comic character growing in popularity ve seen her miniature for sale to play in the marvel crisis protocol game and then they completely change it in the original story blackbolt as seen in the recent dr strange movie releases gas and those whose ancestors were genetically modified by the kree who we know are going to be big deal in the future thanks to the captain marvel film mutate and gain powers revealing them as inhumans the story reminds me lot of the animated static shock series from 2000 this enormous change to the live action character saddens me because enjoyed the mitchells vs the machines style they incorporated with all the little sketches and animations in real space also enjoyed the family interactions and them showing off their pakistani culture but because of the writer complete disregard to ms marvel true powers and origin ve lost interest in watching this ll instead stick with the comics and suggest you do too because bad decisions should not be rewarded ', ' at s i l facility researching the power source known as the tesseract director nick fury samuel jackson oversees the research being conducted by erik selvig steelan skarsgard with the tesseract seeing some unusual activity eventually the tesseract brings forth loki tom hiddleston who has acquired staff that gives him substantial power and uses it to steal the tesseract and take control of selvig and h e d agent clint barton aka hawkeye jeremy renner in response to the threat posed fury sends agent natasha romanoff black widow scarlett johansson to recruit bruce banner mark ruffalo due to his expertise in gamma radiation being necessary in tracking the tesseract and also brings in tony stark iron man robert downey jr and the recently revived steve rogers captain america chris evans to assist in battle which also sees the return of thor chris hemsworth who comes to stop his brother loki the avengers is 2012 superhero film and the concluding chapter to the first phase of the marvel cinematic universe the amount of buildup leading into the avengers was nothing short of astounding only made even more so when you consider the hurdles this series went through to get to this point while the mcu had been planned in advance unlike the comic books it was based upon which had to rely on coordinating the artists writers and editors the films had all that in addition to budgets casts and general feasibility with the noted departure of edward norton as bruce banner following disagreements over 2008 the incredible hulk which ended up being downplayed in terms of its significance to the overall universe and uncertainty that scarlet johansson would even return as black widow with back up script featuring the inclusion of the wasp briefly considered however following re writes by director joss whedon that elaborated on zak penn original script the script and cast was set including soft relaunch of the hulk character with mark ruffalo stepping in for norton upon release the film garnered the best receives of the series since the original iron man and became massive hit too with 200 million opening weekend in the united states that carried it to 600 million domestically and 1 5 million worldwide that most likely gave paramount massive sellers remorse for only taking little over 100 million for distribution of avengers and iron man 3 whoops all these years later now free of the buildup and hype that propelled it to blockbuster status does the avengers still hold up in short yes it does the movie does good job of including and paying off all the characters and plot threads established over the previous films with every character getting their chance to shine even seemingly minor characters like hawkeye and black widow who didn get to do much in their debuts in thor and iron man 2 respectively but do feel like they re allowed to make more of an impression this time around and get some solid standout moments despite being alongside their powered colleagues robert downey jr is really good as tony stark chris hemsworth remains good as thor and chris evans is still as effortlessly likable as captain america and his traditional values where he fought more overtly evil antagonists are contrasted well against world with more shades of grey to it and is probably one of the reasons why captain america movies tended to be the best in this franchise the movie also gives some great moments to its supporting cast including clark gregg welcome return as agent coulson jeremy renner and scarlet johansson get some fun moments as hawkeye and black widow and mark ruffalo gets fantastic introduction as bruce banner hulk with some solid pathos from the character as well as some genuinely amusing humorous moments especially in the climax loki is also solid antagonist who is wonderfully despicable embracing his trickster persona as someone who has considered every possible angle and wants his adversaries to know it there is the occasional gaffe in storytelling such as with loki partners purposefully kept off screen for the sake of laying groundwork for more sequels and wasn quite sure how thor found out about the chitahuri or even their name for that matter but these are minor nitpicks in movie that delivers everywhere it should the avengers is the gold standard for modern cinematic universes and many have tried to copy its formula to only modest success if at all m sure we all remember the dark universe oh wait no we don the avengers does good job of balancing many moving parts and characters and feels like well worth it pay off to the films that preceded it while also laying the groundwork for what to come ', ' the highly anticipated superhero extravaganza avengers turned out to be nothing more than colossal disappointment from start to finish this film was an utter mess failing to deliver on almost every front first and foremost the plot was convoluted and nonsensical it felt like the writers threw in every idea they could think of without any regard for coherence or character development the story jumped from one battle scene to another with no meaningful connection or emotional depth it was chaotic mishmash of flashy special effects and mindless action leaving no room for genuine storytelling the performances were equally lackluster despite the star studded cast the actors seemed uninterested and phoned in their performances the once charismatic and captivating characters were reduced to one dimensional caricatures devoid of any real personality or growth it was disheartening to witness such wasted talent on the screen furthermore the dialogue was cringe worthy at best the attempts at humor fell flat and the attempts at heartfelt moments were contrived and forced it was as if the scriptwriters had run out of original ideas and resorted to recycling tired clich and predictable tropes even the visual effects which are usually saving grace for superhero films were subpar the cgi was inconsistent with moments of stunning visuals mixed with jarring and poorly executed sequences it was constant reminder of the film lack of attention to detail and overall quality in conclusion avengers is disappointing and forgettable addition to the superhero genre it fails to capture the magic and excitement of its predecessors instead succumbing to lazy storytelling uninspired performances and underwhelming visual effects save your time and skip this cinematic disaster ', ' amazing movie it lives up to its hype josh whedon has done an amazing job of blending from all the solo movies and giving us the perfect taste which stands for me as the one of the best movies of 2012 he ensured that he has role for each of the character rather than focusing of few main characters only personally liked the character of iron man and hulk the best part is keeping humor hand to hand with the action scene which ensures perfect entertainment for the viewer special effects were breathtaking and execution was seamless apart of the storyline up all the actors lived up to the expectation must watch at least of 2 3 times ', ' if you can come up with story which is as good as recent endgame spiderman dr strange then don come up with something which is as lousy as this nothing was right from start to end usually the first few minutes is the ideal time to capture the attention of the audience but this movie fails to do that miserably it was so confusing that lost interest from the start by the time you start to acknowledge and make peace with the fact that this is going to be waste of time but you should just sit back and enjoy the movie and finish your popcorn you figure out that you have watched dozens of the same predictable plot extremely extremely disappointed at myself for eagerly waiting for this movie and suggesting friends to watch the first day first show will never ever trust trailers of movies from now on will wait and watch after reading reviews and ratings ', ' superhero the key word is hero this was like watching super power family intervention hollywood endless fight scenes car chases and broken people aren entertainment ', ' ve always been big fan of comics however failed to like any of the movies that have been made over the years featuring these characters with the exception of batman coz think all his movies is actually much better than the comics anyhow now back to our main title today the avengers first have to emphasis that really like scarlet johanson but she is just not cut for these kind of movies physically and character wise the rest all sucks actually did not enjoy the movie actually felt even bored during it and did not like any of the humor it also its crowded and they spend long time talking about technical mechanics and stuff in the dialog that you really lose the story in the middle of it other than that the music sucks the acting sucks and the only explanation how did this movie beat avatar at the box office is that this movie and all of the movies that paved the way to it iron man 1 2 hulk 1 2 thor captain america has all targeted specifically the teens and it was all big very well planned marketed series that all but under the big names there is really nothing to it no matter what think everyone would want to go and see it so try to enjoy if yo could muhannad kalaji ', ' first of all stop calling black widow superhero she is not super hero she an extremely skilled and dangerous assassin that it nothing super about her except for the ridiculous amount of times that she has suffered concussions and still able to walk around like supermodel afterwards in real life she be dead long before this movie half way done like in the first action scene she would ve been dead already this movie is nothing more than spy action movie not superhero movie do we really need to see more ordinary heroes urgh only put 6 stars in it just to pay my respect to stan lee otherwise would ve given it 4 this is the worst marvel movie ever since the hulk ', ' really liked the pakistani aspect im pakistani it was really engaging for me didnt feel bored at any point the story is just building up right now as like in other marvel tv shows they slowly build tempo so guess the next episodes are going to be even more amazing ', ' this is one of the worst movies that mcu has given us cannot even watch the movie or get interested it is full of boring moments not even single enticement but let us give it chance till episode 6 ', ' watched this on disney there is short 57s filmmaker introduction to the film under extras where director cate shortland describes her overall vision of the film that she set out to direct she mentions that she wants viewers to see another side of natasha that we haven seen before and natasha role within her fantastic family found this film to have lot more dramatic depth of characters and their relationships with each other than maybe any other mcu film so far so anyone claiming that this is formulaic disney film is wrong about that the family component and what family really means is the key takeaway form this film the marvel universe is just the backdrop on top of that the story action and humor are up to par with the best mcu films kudos to the director for pulling it off ', ' dont care if sometimes its cheesy just great show so many lessons and so much wisdom friendship and leadership hidden throughout each episode and season alongside all the action ', ' so watched this movie after civil war in my watch through of marvel and let just say that it felt separate story in itself introduces some characters no one particularly stands out the buildup of the movie was actually pretty good as we get to know the tragic past of natasha and everything about the red room was really but as we really reached the red room everything fell flat nothing was original it felt like same old story of defeating the bad guy where we get help from someone with heart in his team favourite character natasha favourite moment guess the sequence of natasha meeting malena ', ' you know you got good series if you have good script followed by good story development both heroes and villains superheroes don have to have superpowers to save sometimes they just need to be as human and frail as possible to get the job done and daredevil is one of those series that shows that ', ' overal the movie is pretty enjoyable the fight scenes were pretty good florence pugh character totally outshined black widow though the movie is overall pretty good until the last 30 minutes were it became pretty cringey they should also replace the guy who cgied the fire and the red spray it pretty atrocious ngl ', ' show that can entertain and build truly solid plot at the same time nowadays is to be commended with so much tv out there it seems like our odds of getting utter poop is higher but every so often we get one that has what it takes to stand above the rest and compete with the elite daredevil is one of those shows the plot development from seasons one and two that have now weighed heavily on season three is masterful and staying true to the comics never hurts appreciate the attention that has been given to the story and the effort the actors have putt in to bring it to life long story short am fan ', ' marvel future avengers is an anime following three kids makoto chloe adi becoming apprentice heroes under the avengers the series follows them figuring out what being hero truly means as the youthful team the future avengers as they believe that you can change your past but you could change your future the first season follows the avengers going up against the masters of evil and kang the conqueror and the second season follows the inhumans feel like it ended little too early as there more of the marvel universe for the future avengers to explore and more big bads they could face season three could bring in the men of which would bring back deadpool of whom seemed like an underutilized character in the series and could bring in the threats of magneto and mister sinister mister sinister might then tie back in with the emerald reign project and help explore the genetic modification themes of the series another thing to help with that is do guardians of the galaxy after that and do the high evolutionary other things the series could also explore based more on the hero part than just genetic modification in future seasons are the fantastic four with them bringing galactus silver surfer and dr doom ultron and thanos that at least what want to be added into the series just the series seems to be cut little too short but besides that it a pretty good series ', ' thought ragnarok was bad captain marvel is worse as much as admired infinity war am now really uncertain if will go see end game recalling how thanos thumped hulk and had his fun is captain marvel going to have her way with thanos will definitely wait and read actual fan reviews before making decision what is utterly certain is will never blindly see another marvel movie ever again this was cringe worthy awful there was no originality no heroic vulnerability and no compelling plot lines if winter soldier is your favorite mcu movie to date you will hate captain marvel in every way that winter soldier succeeded captain marvel failed ', ' would have expected more on her childhood training and her start at secret russian agent other than that it was not bad not excellent neither but certainly not bad ', '

and went to see this today and loved it ', ' worst marvel movie ever wish would have checked comments before throwing my money to the garbage ', ' the main problem is the complete lack of ambition of every last agent ve only seen few episodes maybe m missing that zypher story ark are the agents after something they ll never actually achieve like religious sect as viewer absolutely can get what the characters want should at least understand agent coulson ambition given he is the boss they don need to spell their goals out in star trek can just feel the crews want to explore the universe in scifi show stargate you get that protection vibe and it works just need to look at steve rogers in captain america and know what his movies are going to be about feel that that goal is exactly what missing in agents of shield protect the earth that a stupid goal frankly protect america even stupider normally if you are as well funded as shield you would take the agents somewhere interesting time travel is great idea why for the sake of travelling through time if had to describe what saw with one word it would be pointless ', ' haven gotten round to watching the agent carter television series yet and truth be told have rather low expectations for it this marvel one shot has done nothing to change this while the male agents leave her behind to wrap things up agent peggy carter gets call about case and decides to break protocol to go it alone featuring the always excellent bradley whitford as her less than bareable boss and dominic cooper as howard stark this is distinctly average short and bit of weak link in marvels almost flawless chain atwell is uninspired the plot is generic and though it solidly feels like an addition to the incredible marvel universe it brings nothing note worthy to it the good bradley whitford continuity the bad instantly forgettable stuff things learnt from this short m really not going to like agent carter am ', ' marvel studios has finally brought the whole team together after years of hinting at the avengers initiative coming to fruition to fight united against evil they have done it the avengers was not only reunion of marvel best loved superheroes but it is fun and funny action packed blockbuster movie to kick off the summer movie season as it opened to an astounding 207 4 million the single biggest grossing domestic film opening weekend of all time it topped harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 by more than 38 million the previous record holder why has this film done so well everyone loves it the critics love it 93 rotten tomatoes rating and marvel fans love it and the average moviegoer has loved it the film is almost completely devoid of romance and sex which hurts some of the draw of female audiences but its non stop action fast paced storyline and awesome special effects keeps viewers engaged the odd joke thrown in here and there is brilliant touch that does irritate but instead adds to the experience check out my full review here http reelstorymovies blogspot com 2012 05 marvels avengers html ', ' watched the avengers on the 1st day on 27th may in india what spectacular movie it is full of action entertainment so many wow scene there in every next scene will see best part of the movie robert downey jr iron man again steals the show with his acting attitude and action iron man is the heart of the movie besides iron man hulk will show some power pack action and some comedy tat make to love his character there are some crazy comedy goings within the action scenes on which can resist yourself to laugh fantastic movie great story excellent action and best assemble superheros it is best action movie have watch will again going to see this movie don miss this movie will get more then what pay for ticket go watch it guyzzz ', ' great first act centred on an interesting origin story but things get bland and so typical for marvel afterwards ', ' absolutely loved this film fun filled action movie with likable characters can wait to see these characters in future mcu films and tv series ', ' please if you haven watched it yet don read my review or any other review just go and see it if you are not into marvel movies if you haven watched every other previous installment of the avengers you won find this movie very appealing to you but if you have watched every previous movie if you like the characters then prepare yourself because joss whedon has put together one of the best movies ever made by man thats the thing about this movie its not really movie on its own mean it expects you to know the characters and thats just what it has to be this is not really movie but cinematic experience if the other marvel movies are as getting to know somebody flirting with that somebody foreplay the avengers is sex thats the best way can put it you can really fell that whedon knows and loves this characters because he takes the core elements of each of the avengers personalities and uses them for building the problems the humor the companionship have to say this is the best team assembly have seen this movie has the best humor the best action the best acting the best characterization the best everything for the first time felt nerdgasm m not lying or exaggerating felt it any person who criticizes this movie did not get it at all did not get the point of it because the avengers will change cinema forever mean it love good movies do know lot of movies and m not person that watches only hollywood movies but can say this the avengers is one of the best experiences have ever had in my whole life will see it at least 3 times more ', ' as someone who is totally burned out on multiverse nonsense if multiverse actually existed it would not be full of clones of people in ours it was refreshing to have movie grounded in single timeline mostly lots of action combines with some inspired humor to bring around the best mcu film in while stealing every scene she in is ms marvel gotta go back and watch that series now to catch up captain marvel and the not yet named third member of the group are wonderfully cast alongside nick fury in what is now the shortest film in the series movie should only be as long or short as the story demands and this was on target it not my favorite marvel movie but it a lot better than half of them watch and enjoy ', ' as said in the headline best piece of media have ever laid my eyes upon the voice acting is spectacular and loved the relationship of black widow and the red guardian dad girl the emotions were portrayed in realistic manner and the collector defeat was really the icing on top for this film especially for children content obvious that there was lot of attention paid to the script when we grow up we learn these characters from these shows and in this short film most of the characters were portrayed correctly it was not mediocre for lego film considering only having 46 minutes to present for superhero film truly enjoyed the dynamics between all the characters 100 recommend this film to everyone simply masterpiece ', ' as muslim and pakistani myself this shocked me as to how accurate it was and how relatable kamala really is went in with low expectations cause of the reviews but my god it was awesome from beginning to the end and 100 worth the watch it got me invested with it characters and the story that they are trying to tell and am eagerly awaiting the next ep hope the others are like this as well cause this was really really good ', ' not sure why marvel is making these series coz it can really drive down fans enthusiasm about mcu and it new releases for many months straight m disappointed by tv mcu by these poor shows ', ' bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad

good points good script writing above average acting good cinematography decent character development nice directing among many others the show steadily hypes you to look forward to the next and culminating climax episodes and seasons the inclusion of other marvel characters like elektra kingpin the punisher and bullseye are very exciting to watch and to look forward to the superheroes and supervillains are also not overpowered they get fatigued quite easily like most normal people do the motivations of the characters are believable and relatable to add to the challenge the people behind the series have also added continuously shot fight scenes like 10 15 minute long scenes without cuts which are insane to just even think about overall this superhero series was done right and is on the right track so far looking forward to season 4 off topic recommendations the spin off series of the punisher is also must watch you can forget about luke cage and iron fist jessica jones is quite enjoyable ', ' the first of four collaborations between marvel studios and online streaming service netflix daredevil is fascinating depiction of good versus evil at its core marvel latest foray in television convinces beyond doubt while agents of h e d has largely recovered from sluggish start and sister series agent carter was vast improvement daredevil fulfills its potential to the fullest this transpires partly since this is the initial series to delineate an actual superhero as opposed to newly formed characters first introduced in the silver age of comics in 1964 by legendary scribe stan lee the narrative follows matt murdock charlie cox man who lost his eyesight to an accident when he was young however the mishap grants him heightened senses which he is able to hone with help from his mentor stick scott glen lawyer by profession he takes it upon himself to fight crime not just in the confines of court room but on pedestrian level using his elevated faculties cross between batman and spider man or more accurately batman without the resources or spider man without the web slinging daredevil is best described as glorified ninja his intuition and feline like reflexes are shown particularly well for instance he is often seen using his audioception ability to overcome lack of ophthalmoception sense the show pits daredevil against wilson fisk vincent onofrio the nefarious king pin of crime the latter is firmly in the ascendancy rising from humble beginnings to orchestrate crime syndicate tacitly without exposure or consequence that is until the emergence of the titular protagonist proving that the head that wears the crown is indeed uneasy the central conflict sees both men grappling for the soul of the city they love another strength of the series lies in its portrayal of good and evil in its purest form longtime foes in the comics and faithfully represented on screen both men have distinct visions for their city while one wants desperately to eliminate the threat posed by corruption the other is hell bent on creating malfeasance monopoly furthermore both individuals make certain choices which craft their character for example both are defined by the loss of their fathers although the loss occurs in varying circumstances the influence this bereavement has on both is the polar opposite another captivating sub plot finds our hero motivated but ridden with conflict and inner turmoil constantly at odds with his violent modus operandi religion is sporadically shown as his savior as he struggles to embrace his destiny spiritual healing allows him to test his physical and emotional limits being on netflix means the producers do not need comply with rules of broadcast television each episode is brimming with close combats usually brutal and bloody in nature the expert direction and execution in all scuffles is worthy of much praise grounded in reality and comprised of an ominous tone the program is never afraid to dabble in mature themes the excellent writing is also manifested in the intelligent compelling dialogue 13 episode saga permits the story to delve deep into the personal journey and transformation of every character each of which is sublime the supporting cast consists of foggy nelson elder nelson loyal friend and business partner of matt karen page deborah ann woll determined damsel who is employed by their firm and claire temple rosario dawson reliable aide of matt in city torn apart by demoralization all of the aforementioned characters are vital in his mission to fight this war synthesized by former spartacus show runner steven deknight it also illustrates the fallout from other marvel properties namely the climactic battle seen in the avengers also multitude of easter eggs delight for avid fans are featured on regular basis teasing past and future events while dc comics properties arrow and flash operate in separate universe daredevil is another functional cog in the burgeoning marvel machinery daredevil shows plenty of promise for marvel future on this platform particularly the forthcoming shows all of which will ultimately culminate in miniseries called the defenders much like its blockbuster brethren the marvel cinematic universe ', ' one of the greatest films of the century it still surprises me how joss whedon managed to give every hero something to do which is something kinda feel infinity war didn do as well but what do you expect from movie that crammed over 30 main characters and still make what is in my opinion the greatest movie of all time this movie is prime example of movie that gets better as it goes along the battle of new york is arguably one of the greatest action sequences in film history this also has the added bonus of being the first mcu movie ever saw back in early 2014 all in all this was the film that really sparked the mcu to its full potential ', ' this carnation of the punisher is like delux gourmet hamburger made with second rate meat the original screen versions of built around second string heavies like ray stevenson and thomas jain adequately conveyed the comic book world of the source where declared dead law man gets revenge on mobsters who killed his family and left him for dead then in the pursuit of the real culprits the punisher wastes 50 odd other hoods basically it was simple minded violent revenge porn and didn pretend to be more it was just comic book pablum for adult aged children then netflix comes around and tries to do an upgrade to the comic book schlock franchise with the approval of the lords of marvel now the punisher is an ex special forces killer and the evil doers who kill his family are part of nefarious multi agency government cabal involving the military fbi nsa etc the show also delves into modern surveillance techniques jon berenthal does great job of playing the ptsd wracked hunted vet he is the best part of the show but it all downhill from there in the first episode we were introduced to female version of steve mcqueen bullit right down to the 67 mustang fastback she is also an iranian american moslem too in her first scene she meets her baddy old white guy boss who said she was virtual checklist of affirmative action boxes she of course bristled at this racist but totally true remark she was indeed an affirmative action diversity sake character that doesn exist in reality they could have made her an ex moslem or christian iranian like many of the 1979 refugees but that would nix all the scenes they want to do about white guys getting all izlamofauxbic she is partnered to some nebbish jewish agent who is one step up from stock woody allen character he could have been used for comic relief but we are supposed to take him seriously too then frank belongs to ptsd group of ex soldiers naturally the blacks are all sterling characters who wouldn melt butter in their mouths while the white ones are lame liberal cliches of what trumpster might be even the first round of baddies are lame they are bullies from the construction job where our tormented hero smashes concrete walls to bits with sledge hammer they try to rip off mob card game at night but the fool of the group revealed his identity to the mobsters by dropping his wallet open to his driver license in front of the goons so the other pathetic thief construction workers decide to do the fool in in order to protect themselves frank quickly does those jerks in with sledge hammer then goes to do in the mobsters at their lair finally he gives all the loot from the game to the fool would be thief and tells him to leave the city but he is detected by the mysterious nerd hacker warrior rival partner lieberman who is at least interesting the show has all sorts of relevant messages for the hipster audience concerning gun control racism and other pablum at least the earlier versions of the punisher spared us the preaching ', ' another good entry by mcu not quite at the best level but very good like it better than black panther m not down with the negativity regarding brie larson acting or characterization clint eastwood built an entire career squinting at the camera and he revered for being badass tough guy somehow it unacceptable for woman to have similarly narrow range of expression she nowhere near as inexpressive as clint in some of his movies look forward to seeing her within the context of other movies solo or with others ', ' season 3 is spectacularly awesome every character has story behind and progresses beautifully dark knight trilogy flavoured yet very uniquely positioned season 2 and 1 aren bad too great watch ', ' its just cgi film we get zero to none information about black widow training how she become the black widow what she stand for all saw was just superhuman black widow getting out of fights with zero damages and falling from the 5th floor unharmed you can do way better films marvel disney think this movie needs re writing ', ' am most certainly biased coming from the excellent ms marvel and squirrel girl comics but found an interesting movie about passioned heroes wanting to do their best sometimes don need more than that with all the universe ending drama llamas going on sometimes just want to see squirrel girl and squirrel girl do some awesome heroics and inspire team of new heroes this movie is not that well animated though so if that will bother you just count my rating couple of steps lower tolerate more in movie that makes me feel good afterwards ', ' this movie is an event it can be defined other way for marvel mcu and for the fans and then not for the tight fans like it is for all of the others that never heard too much about the comics world suddenly everyone is hitch hiking this phenomenon and apparently marvel did it before everyone else it has the iconic moments the iconic music and all of legendary characters that you have collected each and every piece of merchandise that got out whether you are child or parent it is wide phenomenon and now 12 years after going out with first avengers movie we are witnessing to another attempt to create this world once again it two years the story is known for everyone except my children have to state that now its magic is so much less attractive then it was 12 years ago but it still works each and every time still cool still nails it and still looks amazing with all of the classical superheroes and those that shoot with bow and arrow now lot of dots are connecting because am older smarter not sure and remembers several details from future mcu movies now all of the enthusiasm went straight to the kids and skipped my grumpier older man that tries to burst outside not lot to add then what is almost common knowledge but this one was great springboard for the entire mcu universe to lean on ', ' the writers must think their audience is the stupidest people in the world numerous scenes that make no sense at all just one for example she is super strong when she grabs hold of kilgrave as he is escaping from the sealed room why does she not crush his arm remember she does not know he can no longer control her why could she not break away from an old cop that has hold on her leg she comes out of the building he can be seen anywhere why does she not jump to the top of building and try to locate him all along from episode one was yelling at the monitor about stupid audience writing this scene was the last straw had to write this review pitiful ', ' about the first season the first 15 episodes wont give you anything it will be like watching xena episodes no patos no file rouge no suspense nothing to wait from the next episode too quick machinations where everything got resolved to easily in almost ridiculous way one sense fighting scenes easy solution to go out from the wood but don give up in one shocking episode you wont notice the ridiculos way and the too quick machinations anymore indeed they will become good way to let the story flows easily starting grabs you with shocking plot twist episodes by episodes bounded by file rouge which never become too intricate without giving you unexplained expectations just being very appealing the second season starts where the first was over not disappointing you taking the same style and giving you reason to to follow an episode after another enjoy it ', ' was going into the movie expecting the same old generic marvel movie but instead got more than that in some ways m very happy with the result this movie is not only great marvel movie but good movie altogether because unlike lot of marvel movies it does feel like there are stakes key thing missing in lot of the mcu part of that is because of the spy thriller elements to this movie that keep the tone darker when necessary and incorporate some good sets but also because of the heart and emotion in this movie that is conveyed through the trauma each of the main characters have to deal with somewhat and their connectivity as family each of the characters do have lot of the witty humour but it doesn come across as being so formulaic here instead it actually funny and only used appropriately along with that the characters are individual and each have real stakes in the story although most are lacking proper depth this movie also has lot of really engaging spy thriller elements more akin to the mission impossible films which gives it more unique tone for an mcu movie and makes for some great action sequences the main villain serves his purpose in the story and provides shadow of mystery and looming sense of threat before he is introduced to be ruthless and cold making for decent antagonist however what brings this movie down is that it presents so many potentially complex and dark themes but as usual with the mcu it doesn fully engage with the concepts presented and thus gives the characters less depth other than that this is solid action flick that goes beyond most marvel films and is sure to entertain ', ' well it was pretty cute first episode ll watch for continuity in marvel but it wasn really that good it just seemed very much for pre teens audience like disney tv show and less like marvel show ', ' have been fan of jon bernthal since his incredible performance on twd his current role as the punisher has given him great platform to show off his true acting capabilities the man can scare you to death one minute and then have you rooting on him the next he has brought fresh interpretation to the role of the anti hero he is also accompanied by an incredible cast special shoutout to ebon moss bachrach as micro ben barnes as billy russo daniel webber as lewis wilson similar to daredevil the fighting sequences will have you cringing at the sheer brutality that you truly believe you are watching the character development and the dialogue is also done very very well the 13 episode span allows for well paced story line that concludes successfully while creating enough depth for future seasons if you are fan of the thriller drama action category what are you waiting for this is the show for you happy viewing ', ' he was incredible in the first season it what made me love the show however after watching the second season realised there is no appeal without him ', ' this movie is just bad don want to see movies like this ', ' is this the best marvel movie yet like all the snippets from magazines say sadly not and it had the unfortunate honour of following infinity war which was always going to be tough no matter if you liked that or not there are the usual humourous moments as always in this universe and laughed aloud few times but some of the main character humour seemed forced sometimes lines placed where they weren needed etc brie was superb though when you take away un needed dialog the characters all worked well together and the story went along nicely it left me feeling similar to the origin stories of captain america and iron man enjoyed it some of the action was superb but wasn wanting to buy another ticket and watch it again ', ' this is the worst marvel movie ever mean the cg is good but the story the plotine superhero vibe absolutely zero compared to this wonder woman was on whole different level there are reasons for that because wonder women firs into the dc storyline she is very important member of jl but captain marvel looks like just big money making ploy highly disappointed ', ' the season 3 is amazing for me the best vincent onofrio did an incredible performance an the characters are very good ', ' everyone loves agent coulson love agent coulson but very quickly am seeing marvel jumping the shark marvel is working under the assumption that everyone loves the marvel movie series good stuff good stuff marvel is also working under the assumption that everyone loves joss whedon will wheaton whoever ick look it is glossy and fun but it only lasts as long as fan film can go this pilot passes as fan film coulson is great peripheral character but it is like putting too much salt on your food add the fact the effects are obviously not as expensive as the films shield story lines in the comics can be more often than not annoying as heck the casual viewer trying to tune in to get another marvel movie experience is going to get generic franchise that is shooting itself in he foot the pilot isn dreadful but the pilot is already too much of good thing and it is tiresome it needs to either go completely marvel or just accept this is ncis with superheroes and the fact it is playing at the exact same time as ncis well already know what to watch ', ' understand this series is targeting small kids but the quality of the show is miles below watchable the plot is almost nonexistent majority of the screen time is spent on propagating certain culture dialogs are written by kids suppose after episode 4 can totally say that this is the worst marvel tv series that they made till this day ', ' enjoyed this movie it didnt feel like it dragged for hours like some other marvel movies didnt see ms marvel and maybe that is why was not fan of her character slj and bl are very good on screen and maybe more of that was needed the chemestry for the leading ladies doesnt feel organic like iron man and cpt america but it works in the end it is not the worse mcu movie out there maybe the strike and hero fatigue is killing the movie and the fact that people dislike brie larson for the 1st marvel movie see it with an open mind and block out the noise did and enjoyed the movie ', ' just watch the first episode and then jump to the last one the 4 inbetween are boring very surprised with my marvel on this one given it 5 stars for effort roll on she hulk ', ' what an epic series and the role of kamala khan was awesomely played by iman i have always loved superheroes series but this one has crossed all the boundaries of excitement in my heart ', ' superhero movies have been the craze for while now sure they ve always been around but now they seem to be coming out in droves either new hero to make movie for yet another sequel to an existing series batman 1 3 spiderman 1 3 amazing spiderman 1 2 iron man 1 3 captain america 1 2 thor 1 2 and the extensive men series to name few or another reboot yes they are popular but for the most part extremely formulaic other than nolan batman series there is not much new in any of those movies and the avengers is no different maybe even worse everything you expect to see in the avengers you will see some snappy one liners from downey jr explosions an excessive use of cgi good guys win bad guys lose dot dot dot think ve seen this one before there is no creativity no thought nothing really if you enjoy movies that require no thought this one is for you and the hype put this up there with the fast the furious it that bad yet so many people seem to love it are we really that unimaginative and dull it only exciting if you can see past the cgi and battle scenes if you would like to watch superhero movie with actual substance watchmen is terrific example they are the anti avengers if you will enough with these cookie cutter characters please don waste your time on this one ', ' unless you have less than 15 years old or have daughters don even bother to pay ticket to watch it bad fx bad script bad character development and bad story development it looks like someone asked chatgpt to write script to introduce the new group of marvel superheroes using captain marvel 15m into the movie and still was trying to figure out the plot the why it really bad nick furry is caricature of what we re used to captain marvel is joke of what she capable to do the cats and the fx are so bad it like was watching disney channel kids show bad jokes no emotions only teenager who can stop screaming of excitement this movie is joke why do they even bother to release it to the theater m sad because like captain marvel but it has been undermined since the beginning the most powerful marvel superhero is just joke in this movie as well as everything else rip captain marvel movies ', ' the only reason walked into the screening because of its ridiculous hype even by the most trusted critics beyond that even the featurette or trailers did not interest me at all felt like watched something out of kids happy meal and if we are going to expect movies like these in future receiving undeserving acclaim and astounding attention then guess it is indeed an offense of naming and giving out razzberry awards as would believe that there are movies with poor reception to be actually highly underrated the movie starts off with lousy science experiment at one of the h e ds lab where portal opens up allowing loki from an alternate universe to pop in and to begin with his agenda of destruction and dominance in response to the threat the director of h e d nick fury opens up the avenger initiative which has all the super humans or superheroes to team up for you know what the movie is cocktail of lousy plot poor acting except for robert downey jr whose presence in the film made it tolerable to some extent worst of all it was samuel jackson in his role as the director of h e d nick fury seriously had problem of tolerating his presence on screen with his unethical portrayal of his character he only wouldn be the sole perpetrator as everyone else except for robert again also portrayed their respective roles like they were starring in some sort of parody of the original praise would go to the visual effects and the action sequences which don think it is much of giant leap for mankind in the present date with good budget of 250 million well of course hats off to the animators and sfx designers who did an excellent job to save the sinking boat at least making it an visual spectacle the movie is strictly for kids who would certainly enjoy it so if you are thinking of spending some time out with your kids for the weekend you won disappoint them ', ' ve noticed that most of these super heroes battling super villain films get very high viewer scores on imdb 8 0 or above clearly many people love this kind of movie don my thoughts saw this on plane several years ago ve seen several others in the genre in this film they all seem to be like this the heroes are battling to save the world sometimes they battle to save the galaxy or even the universe in this film the plot setup is so ridiculous can take any of it even halfway seriously but the genre fans are pleased because it delivers the one supreme thing they care most about beings with super powers fighting each other much of this very over long movie consists of characters battling flying around running around more fighting etc etc my reaction giant yawn what bore see before these kinds of movies say before star wars as point of reference most movies were not focused on battle scenes explosions fate of worlds etc they were about characters and human not alien etc beings action scenes even in action films did not take up most of the screen time now there have been so many of these films they all seem alike it way beyond saturation so if you are entertained by lots of fighting using special effects you may well like this otherwise don waste your time ', ' amazing performances by jon bernthal ben barnes ebon moss bachrach and daniel webber there are moments where it feels dragged showing us characters that have very little appeal however they make it up to us with beautifully choreographed action ', ' did not envy the mammoth task that joss whedon had in front of him some seriously good characters had been developed in some very impressive comic book films already so he had to tread very carefully in order to not destroy what had been carefully created he then had to bring them all together into one film and make sure that they all had purpose and that one did not outshine the other so did it work well the answer is yes beyond anything we could have expected too okay the plot is not original in anyway and it was fairly predictable but wasn going to see the usual suspects after all what do comic characters do they fight bad guys and save the world and that is exactly what we get what really surprised me is how some of the characters that only had minor roles in the previous films rose to the occasion and held their own the black widow and hawkeye really played their part which before had seen it was sceptical about captain america never really over impressed me in his own outing he was good but that it in this he shone through becoming vital leadership role coordinating the avengers throughout the end battle thor did his bit probably the only character that didn bring us anything special loki was outstanding clever funny and likable something that bruce banner amusingly points out of coarse iron man steels the show did we expect anything less from downey jnr however close match was the hulk who delivers some of the best moments in the film the end battle is everything you expect it to be and if you are seeing it in 3d you are in for real treat the humour is absolutely spot on what whedon does best with all of the characters no matter what world they are from they are very human in nature which think is the biggest key to the success of the marvel comic book films everyone has sense of humour and through major life threatening situations they still keep it nobody is too serious there are few people that feel they have to go against the norm and put film like this down maybe they feel that by becoming simon cowell and are very hard to please that makes them feel powerful and respected but the truth is that it is very sad that people behave like this the bottom line is that all films are really supposed to be is entertainment if you want to cry you go see the green mile if you want to laugh you go see american pie if you want gore you see hostel and if you want to see blockbuster action you go see avengers assemble film should be taken for what it is and if you go see this film for oscar winning performances and clever plot twists then m afraid you will be extremely disappointed and quite frankly you should keep your opinions to yourselves people are relying more and more on reviews to decide whether they should bother to go and see something and good film reviewer should be flexible enough to see through the eyes of the audience it is aiming for ignore the bad reviews if it big scale action with vibrant characters and great humour you are after then you cannot miss this gem the last time was buzzing like this after film was when saw jurassic park on the big screen for the first time when was 13 years old bring on the sequel ', ' first and third season are both very good second season is little below par but generally the writing the characters and the action scenes are just better than the others although did like iron fist to unlike most the villains in season 1 and 3 are also very good really hated them and that makes you more invested also think the humour is better in this show especially in season 1 one thing am little tired of from these shows though is the tendency to make the so called hero run around and protect the villains that is so annoying this weird philosophy they have that if you kill bad people you become bad person yourself should be buried ', ' hopefully there will be season 3 and netflix would not stop the series when all when all the good series are leaving of netflix ', ' marvel what did you do with this one get the idea of showing the indian culture but it misses the main point of super hero series action and good cgi the actress is good but it looked like soup opera ', ' with chocolate lover boy kind of hero who doesn have screen presence with copy and paste kind of action scenes throughout even with cretches of punisher and other super heroes daredevil falls short on every front one of marvel worst only surprise is the super duper rating ', ' well enjoyed the first series so much the film that came out years ago didn do it justice has so much action doesn lack story line enjoyed all 13 episodes so wen saw season 2 had came out couldn wait to watch it well have now finished all 13 episodes and can safely say for those who enjoyed the first will defiantly love this its got everything need in good series it doesn over step that boundary of bringing silliness like other series iv watched the twists and turns giving it very fresh feel but keeping its appeal m now eagerly waiting for season 3 watch it and give it go ', ' it is by far more disrespectful to not recast tchalla than to recast him to not recast him to me it seems like there is ulterior motive probably jealousy or maybe bigoted issue to not have tchalla in bp movie makes no sense if fans really care or have sense they will boycott bp2 and future bp movies until tchalla is casted it very disrespectful first current age major so called black hero and he gets swept under the rug get it mr 42 aka boseman apparently passed away so have many james bond and superman boseman did not own or make tchalla or bp stan lee and kirby created him and now disney owns black panther okay since stan lee and kirby passed why not cancel the mcu since walt disney is dead why not cancel disney overall feel it disrespectful to not recast tchalla than it is to recast him bp2 will seem very stupid to not have tchalla any in story reason for tchalla not being around will sound horrible and rushed bp2 will likely be worse than the first ', ' loved the punisher as kid had the comics and watched all movies was thrilled to check out the series even though wasn convinced that bernthal would fit in but he did quite well actually somehow you felt that the writers became lazy at times it was better to turn off the brain and not question many things to fully enjoy the show as an experienced viewer you won see anything new since it quotes many other series and movies season 2 is not worth mentioning pass that but kudos to marvel to turn up the violence ', ' this movie makes any superhero nerd shake with excitement to see your childhood memories come to life is great the cgi is pretty good there are some very funny moments in the film most of which comes from robert downey jr whenever there is action you can clearly tell whats happening and you can really enjoy it then when the final battle happens and ends it made me just feel good you see six heroes just work together and it just pleases you the two after credits scenes are also enjoyable with joss whedon setting up thanos years from 2012 and the shwarma scene which is just funny it is my third favorite marvel movie behind guardians of the galaxy and infinity war ', ' an extremely fun and quality series that only continued to get better and more captivating as it went along agent of shield will definitely go down as one of the best shows to come out of the mcu ', ' loved iron man and thor enjoyed captain america the first avenger and was slightly disappointed in iron man 2 but even the best of those movies were just lead up to the avengers which is absolutely one of the finest superhero movies and one of the most entertaining movies of any kind that ve seen this is pure summer blockbuster fun and don mean that in way that limits the movie but instead as an example of the best of what summer blockbuster can be the story is rather straightforward massive threat to earth that too big for any of our heroes to handle alone and rocky road of butting egos and misunderstandings stands between them and working together as team it clear easy to follow and only has the briefest moments of lost momentum the avengers feels like it the perfect length with no action scenes that drag on too long into mindlessness or uneven pacing what struck me most about it was the humor it carried the movie even more than the excellent action scenes the well handled exposition or the interplay between our heroes the avengers is outright hilarious at times the laughs are woven organically throughout the tone of the movie just feels right which is probably the best compliment that can give it must say that my expectations were easily surpassed by the first assembly of the earth mightiest heroes marvel definitely made the right decision to carefully lay the groundwork for the avengers the past few years and it paid off and it helps immensely that they chose the right man to write and direct it can wait for avengers 2 ', ' gave up 3 4 of the way through there is only so much gratuitous violence and suffering can stomach homeland and 24 did violence better the bridge suffers from the same problem ', ' think it was great movie which has all the elements that you would expect from typical movie and more specifically great storyline took time to set the scene on character development clear easy to follow good pacing for the most part great action scenes m in awe of the stunt team casting on point all the cast fit the roles well notably loved the fact the cast was heavily female they also did well on the diversity front beautiful filming locations cinematography minor critiques would have given higher rating if not for the following reasons storyline at the end kinda felt unfulfilled can put my finger on why perhaps they could have done more to make us despise the villian him sitting in his office pressing button doesn feel that ruthless for marvel villain which would have perhaps made the ending more satisfying pacing there were some scenes that think could have gone more quickly such as the segment with everyone at the mum house casting happy with this generally although found the forced accents really distracting and think it would have been better to either cast people who actually have that accent or find reason for the character to have their own accent cringy script could sense the pauses in the script for when we were meant to laugh but it not big deal overall really enjoyed it would suggest to watch it if you don mind slower paced movie you re marvel fan ', ' regardless of how much specter of this movie still enjoyed it expected better plot and better goodbye for black widow did however enjoyed her sister she was the best part of the movie would watch again because m huge marvel fan but definitely not my favorite ', ' cheesy and the cgi was awful for movie with 200 mil budget looked like it was directed by michael bay ', ' the movie was shouting so loud to catch attention and it certainly did too bad it was so disappointing and shallow afterwards 3d did not entertain or maybe dragged the whole movie down even more than the sad plot from the beginning it was clear to me that the movie won jump high enough and come up to my expectations all had to do was watch the trailer and it told me how the whole movie will be explosions dorky costumes pointless dialogs and lame jokes that recently have flooded hollywood surely when the avengers came out and saw the rating 8 8 assumed that was wrong such great score just had to see this magnificent most brilliant movie ever time in the theater passed and my little sparkle died rather quickly not only did some parts could have been cut out to shorten the torture but they could have added little bit of originality too no matter how look at it some scenes and ideas resemble transformers 3 this was not brilliant at all perhaps when overjoyed comic lovers settles down the avengers will reach its true rating and be remembered as another common hollywood trash as for now can only weep for my money ', ' this film needs to get at least twice as good to be horrible thor the dark world thanks you all that acting talent decent storyline and big pile of fibre filled bowel expulsion ends up being the sum ', ' on may 4 2012 many marvel fans were on the edge of their seats and was one of those fans can say that our expectancy for the new movie the avengers was through the roof and we would not be happy with anything under five stars marvel had promised the avengers initiative would return and from that point on it had been waiting game however combining all of the super heroes into one great team yet each holding their old attitudes had to take time the wait was well worth it though marvel really dished it out they produced movie that could watch over and over again and never be bored the cast was wonderful and can say that there was single actor that did not play their part perfectly the movie was full of action and there was never dull moment in the humor however if you have not seen the other movies leading up to it you may find yourself lost in some parts the plot was phenomenal and was accompanied by visual effects that put you inside the movie itself would highly recommend this movie to everyone it is entertaining humorous and overall blast to watch some of the characters showed their true colors in this movie more than in their own productions one of my favorite quotes in the movie being captain america thoughts on thor when he says there is only one god and m pretty sure he doesn dress like that aside from my thoughts one actor that really deserves round of applause is mark ruffalo as the hulk through the movie he acts seamlessly from the doctor straight into the hulk and back if you want an action packed movie with an all around amazing experience would definitely recommend the avengers to you ', ' will consider black widow as one of the best marvel movies ever produced went into the cinema expecting standard avenger flick and left god smack as how mature well written and highly performed this movie was from characters to written plot from fight scenes to directing from plot to great humour from scenery to set designs every single box is big fat tick you do not even have to be fan of the avenger series as the movie successfully stands on its own two feet yet it also starts to suttlely place the foundation for next phase of the avengers franchise this movie was such surprise 10 is usually reserve for my absolute favourite movies of all time so rating 9 is impressive ', ' the script is probably one of the worst to be done by marvel so it is not shock that the rest falls apart the acting is fine and pugh and scarlett do their best but some of the storyline is just terrible it almost becomes bad family comedy in the 2nd act and the russian accents are pathetic why hire british actor to play the villain and he still sounds british why not hire the eons of russian actors that can act the part john wick series shows one how to properly hire russian actors it is by far the worst marvel film have seen and still confused why they hired the indy director but it is not her fault that the script sucked cgi was solid and it looked good overall but terrible script can never be fixed on screen 5 star rating and that is being very generous hope next one is better ', ' starting is some what boring but in the end it starts as marvel series may be we need to see another episode where we can enjoy it so need to keep eye on second episode ', ' loved it it was well acted smart script and exciting can wait to take my girls to it ', ' ll try and keep this brief and on point netflix owns all marvel tv series and judging by imdb ratings daredevil was the highest rated of the defenders group and punisher wasn far behind these ratings have not reflected recent decisions around funding daredevil was shelved for some reason because it was white male protagonist can see any other reason judging by ratings and reviews while the worst two were kept iron fist and jessica jones luke cage was also cancelled and had rather high ratings was it not pc enough of those two who were kept iron fist was written so the male hero became powerless and woman took the reigns leaving only punisher this once action packed series series that paid tribute to veterans during season 1 good move considering the times we live in but an action packed season 1 was followed up by near actionless season 2 clearly punisher in spite of being the second highest rated of the 5 marvel tv series netflix owns had its funding cut obviously because there about 70 less special effects and action scenes this feels very political and its interesting that socialist country owns the network of netflix now not making any accusations but it is very interesting to notice the pattern ', ' they are killing the money monster they accidentally created with these many productions think marvel has not taken the time to build strong characters any more like they did previously over long long period of time like spider man or iron man and they expect us to love characters we barely know m not hardcore comic fan so don know for sure but m pretty sure they have already used up some of the big characters the new phase has some good movies like love and thunder guardians of the galaxy etc but just think they are just rushing everything and squeezing every last drop from the almost gone og cast this production feels like it was done in three weeks but m sure it wasn the story is just forced down on the poor audience assuming everyone has watched all the previous releases so it enjoyable for them and they don walk out of the theater thinking what the hell did just watch can convince my mom that marvel is cool because she just doesn know who is who or what what in this particular film just because she is not nerd like me who has watched 30 movies and 6 tv series saddly still love it and love kamala harris and carol danvers in the mcu but just because ve watched hours worth of marvel tv series wanda vision secret invasion hawkeye and ms marvel believe marvel thinks they re more popular than they actually are in pop culture and expects the hardcore mcu fans to fill the movie theaters which will not happen popular marvel super heroes fill movie theaters because we ve known them for years but even we superhero fans can buy enough tickets to pay for this movie they need to be smarter if they want to continue making super hero movies didn really like it as stand alone but since ve watched the series found it entertaining but know it a bad movie in pretty much every aspect and could well be tv episode you can skip 4 10 ', ' just 5 for the endless boring dialogs almost slept during the scenes that had endless dialogs hope in next marvel movie that will participate black widow or generally in next marvel movie they will reduce dramatically the dialogs ', ' the mcu has consistently released high quality films that have coherent and engrossing back story that fit and connect into the puzzle of the wider universe with the bar so high anything that drops below the bench mark stands out that was the case with the hulk eternals both of which appear to be quietly forgotten about and here the issue here is not the character we long since fell in love with her in the ironman and avenger films or scarlett acting which is always on point it simply weak plot seemingly pushed out to make money off popular secondary character rather than fitting into wider intertwined story it riddled with plot holes and questionable acting which could so easily have been short tv show on disney instead sadly forgettable mcu instalment just done badly ', ' after amazing first season was waiting for this show to go on and when we finally got the second season instead of wow effect it had ew effect first of all boring slow going script almost no real action just gum chewing and drama second of all you guys should really reconsider your makeup artists that amount of fake blood ve only seen in 1970s movies seriously made me laugh lot dracula castle lol and m not even talking about toilet fight scene next irritating bad acting of the blond girl absolute nonsense of the script whatsoever who when why crazy bad religious guys really as result lot of whining and poker faces do not watch the second season ', ' this is another waste from marvel very stupid web series looks like cheap local paki tv show nothing new in terms of story and contents most of episodes are very boaring with lack of good performance in episode 5 they played with history and showed one sided showing muslims as victims but this is completely false they demanded for seperate nation and still this show playing false narrative of victimhood both communities faced horror in partition ', ' as someone said before me really tried to like it sadly don like it ritter sucks actually the whole casting sucks and the writing is inconsistent and poor this show could be much better with better casting ritter looks like she genuinely bored but hey maybe they wanted her to look like that well if see only one sole true emotion from the lead actor in the whole show that can be either funny or just simply boring this one is not funny rating 8 8 is unbelievable really love marvel but j sucks and yeah about the title super hero sex it seems that when you find out you can have super hero super sex that the only thing you ll ever do just bang till you drop every day rich writing what can say rate 6 just because it marvel ', ' apparently secret warriors is now thing and likely to spawn spew of new movies and television series essentially it marvels answer to teen titans and m not impressed to be fair m not exactly the demographic but it not who you expect either the main problem is that it so kiddish and as marvel superheroes have evolved so far and gone beyond saturday morning cartoons feel this is step backwards it doesn need to be rated but happy medium would have made considerably more sense here we see the most modern version of ms marvel teaming with squirrel girl to take on the bad guys and form the titular team the animation is lazy the plot is generic and it all so damn childish to its credit it is bringing some lesser to known characters into the spotlight and pushing captain marvel further in as she ll be an integral part of the mcu also the voice talent though not great is at least consistent as we have several people playing characters they ve played before such as agent of shields own chloe bennet playing quake again see what they re doing here just don think they ve done it very well it full of moral messages and that great it has it heart in the right place but as franchise m unimpressed the good strong morale code and messages some of the logic behind this makes sense the bad some horrid animation that soundtrack really too much silliness things learnt from this movie squirrel girl is approximately 50 adorable and 50 annoying ', ' tldr basically the title wrote says it all started watching with very little interest or hope for good show couple episodes in actually noticed to be liking it likeable characters and interesting cultural stuff but then further we go the less sense it makes and as already mentioned by many many others and happened so many times it becomes total mess no more likeability just confusion really wanted to like it more given that my initial feeling was that m not going to and then actually did but in the end ended up with what initially had thought feared such shame you can give it try as said for example the cultural stuff and premise did find interesting and therefore would say already it enough to give it go just don expect to be satisfied after finishing it ', ' excellent script great 2nd part great actors excellent script great 2nd part great actors ', ' apart from acting of the protagonists which also sometimes looked forced everything else is bad worst direction poor script cgi was ok bad music you name it ', ' was looking forward to watching this tv series because like the avengers but have been very disappointed with the show the story lines are weak the characters are even weaker suppose this is what happens inside the mobile office when action heroes are busy outside the office even the main character of the show coulson was not main character of the avengers and the two suppose to be nerds are so annoying that they ruin the story line when they talk stopped watching the show after 4 episodes didn want to wait until see melinda may breaks nail or the nerds have paper cut in the mobile office or coulson doesn wear suit is this what avengers are all about ', ' believe at this point they are fast tracking to the meat and bones of this phase because they know marvel is spiraling you can be the person that says at least they re making money or stop hanging onto old fruit and accept the new world what exactly is that is kang still the alpha villain like thanos are they phasing out jonathan majors for loki have no clue where this is heading marvels gave me no clue about anything except for the end which was pretty cool to see mean they could ve gotten away with groot type of series for the ending and we would ve been good when watch marvel movies want to immerse myself in that world during and even after m done watching it this movie felt like it was just thrown together and made me feel like they are just slapping marvel on anything because they know it sell instead of building new universe post thanos its no for me dawg ', ' ms marvel isn your typical mcu project now that endgame is over it been branching out and taking more risks if you will to give more and more people show that relates to them myself like others m sure they ll try every show and movie as everything is connected but just because you don fit into that category doesn make it bad ms marvel isn suppose to attract everyone it was advertised as more kid friendly show for it for people who have wanted character that relates to them in ways iron man and spider man can and from reviews it done an incredible job of showing what it like for pakistan family move to america and how the parents are and the traditions they follow m 24 and love the show yeah the dialogue sometimes are hit and miss but that nothing new ms marvel has an interesting style with how they show you the texts on screen and iman vellani is an incredible talent for her age can imagine how it feels to have watched all of the mcu as fan and then being able to play as your favourite hero ', ' try to watch almost everything marvel because m big fan and have been for long time this is the first new marvel series that couldn

are entire episodes that go nowhere they feel like filler like in an anime but not as fun scenes are mostly flat and the fight scenes are lazy badly choreographed and slow the basic plot is simple and is not as interesting as it could be the majority of the writers and directors of this season 3 have 10 credits to their name total they are obviously not comic fans and have not read much the source material changing certain elements of the characters in order to adapt them to the small screen is understandable but making the entire season boring and slow is not do you guys want to make money or not make good and entertaining show there are many scenes that revolve around characters telling some sad sob story that leads to fake oouuh moment where the audience is supposed see the scenes as nuanced material but its just junk along with jessica jones season two luke cage season two and all of iron fist its an absolute disappointment and will get cancelled soon good luck idiots to the writters and directors ', ' tried not to allow the loud media pollution regarding this film to influence my judgment so went in with an open mind and after hard annoying day at work let my hair down

finding herself in the midst of war between two races she rightly assumes the rank of captain marvel btw we also learn how agent fury loses an eye can wait to see more of brie in avengers endgame ', ' greetings again from the darkness the concern coming in was that this would be like an all star game which as any sports fan will tell you is typically massive letdown assembling so many super heroes and colorful characters into one movie captain america thor iron man hawkeye black widow nick fury and loki would probably lead to either mass confusion 4 hour movie or short straws for couple of characters somehow director joss whedon has avoided the pitfalls and delivered huge action film that is loads of fun for everyone including the fanboys whedon does remarkable job of giving each character their fair share of screen time and somehow manages to make the interaction between the characters the best part of the movie there is some terrific dialogue and the number of quick witted exchanges are too numerous to recount while this would be expected from robert downey jr iron man must admit to being pleasantly surprised at chris hemsworth thor and especially mark ruffalo dr banner hulk the movie contains quite few laugh outloud moments which is pretty impressive in filled theatre if you are going to combine six super heroes in movie you need bad guy villain actually super villain tom hiddleston as loki is up to the task for me he was weak link in thor but here is full fledged powerful evil mastermind looking to gain power by stealing the tesseract cosmic cube commanding an alien army and ruling earth hiddleston is clearly having fun and it shows for the movie to work at all his plan and power must stand up to the impressive line up of good guys he is fighting that is certainly the case scarlett johansson as black widow has come long way from her brief work in iron man2 and we really get to know more about natasha the russian spy although her accent fades in and out jeremy renner as hawkeye seems bit out of place but renner is so cool we don really care chris evans as captain america does wonderful job of taking control of the band of misfits and displays the leadership expected of super soldier we even get good dose of agent coulson phil to his friends and clark gregg deadpan deliver is great addition samuel jackson as nick fury will be adding hundreds of millions more to his current record of being the highest grossing actor of all time gwyneth paltrow is back as pepper potts since last we saw her she has evidently been shopping for short shorts and helping design the new stark tower natalie portman makes creative cameo reprising her awful role in thor stellan skarsgard is back as believable scientist powers boothe appears as member of the council that fury reports to the great harry dean stanton has comical scene as security guard who stumbles onto hulk mess and of course stan lee makes his well deserved cameo appearance tradition in the marvel movies much of the credit for this must go to joss whedon he may finally be out of his buffy the vampire slayer shadow as this movie is quite an accomplishment entertaining and funny for the masses yet detailed enough for the comic book fan boys was thinking how much fun this would be for 10 12 year old and how my mind might have exploded if something like this existed in my childhood even comparing this to the christoper reeve superman movies will help you realize just how far super heroes movies have come ', ' anyone that reviews this as 1or 2 is

it was fun and entertaining for me perhaps most of ppl hate the series just because you know why and that is absolutely unfair m really enjoyed it ', ' just saw the movie have been comic reader and movie goer for more than twenty years now and film like this should have been my wet dream instead what saw was hollow empty attempt to recreate the magic of the original comic book an attempt that poorly fails in miserable way despite or should say thanks to all the special effects and the star power the producers have tried to throw in the fantasy the wit the ideas that were present in the comic and that made it the dreams and the joy of so many kids were completely absent in this studio behemoth will admit that the recreation of such magic was difficult task probably doomed from the beginning but this thing is completely lacking brain or direction or any meaning at all the script is total and utter disaster full of bore and incredibly shallow and it goes just ridiculous every time it tries to go funny with sketches and jokes all very similar between themselves will rate the movie 2 stars just to give it credit for having been able to give us the first decent banner hulk it took only three attempts to the hollywood writers and god knows how many millions of dollars wasted movies like avengers are unlucky children that inherit only all the defects from both the parents which in this case would be mr mainstream comics and mrs movie industry this leaves them with basically no audience they are too much gruesome and boring for kids too much childish for youngsters while for the adults at least for those the grown up ones there are just too many capes the same stories printed on comic pages still resonate in popular culture after decades but this movie will be hopefully forgotten as soon as the media battage slow down ', ' black wid oh ho ho ho yaaawn started well then it became funny then it was boooring ', ' this should have been something that the marvel

' truly fantastic movie and the first of its kind marvel did terrific job way to go making so many superhero movies and connecting all to each other is hell of job when it all started with iron man 2008 no one could imagine that the franchise would grow this big all because of marvel we were able to enjoy this movie only months remaining for age of ultron to come and m sure that will surpass this movie too tom hiddleston did great job in the movie as loki robert downey jr was always great as usual and along with him every other actor namely chris evans chris hemsworth mark ruffalo jeremy renner scarlett johansson and samuel jackson special mention cobie smulders and clark gregg ', ' this is basically teen drama that would be fine with me don mind teen drama but this is supposed to be superhero show and there is almost no superhero stuff the few power moments are all stupid stuff here we have power capable of traveling through universes but actually look it can make stepping stones shields sometimes big hand when the plot asks for it and the classic round energy explosion around body the show even made me believe something good would happen because the main character actually trains to try and learn how to use the powers but no that just fake and there is no change to her skills throughout the whole episodes to make everything even worse felt like was watching an indian soap opera there is so much so much indian culture exposition every episode keeps reinforcing words history culture it is beautiful culture the cinematography is beautiful it is beautiful show to watch but if wanted to learn about indian culture there are better stuff out there thank you m here for some dumb fictional superhero powers and fights you know universe ending ones hated it hated every minute of it and it sucks because the actors are great and don deserve this hate and how come this has higher review score than she hulk she hulk is what expected it to be bad in current marvel

the dd s2 was very excited and my girlfriend liked his character most and also wanted him his own series and here it is true masterpiece of marvel series which beside shows us what veterans thrown back to normal life without psycho social care might become ticking time bomb beyond the behavior of normal human beings sociopath on his own mission collector of souls punisher ', ' m long time marvel comic reader and know the superheroes in the avengers quite extensively hulk being my number one read and the avengers in my top 10 this movie was well made with loads of entertainment possibly to capture all audience members who have very little to no knowledge of marvel comics if was to walk into this movie without knowing anything about marvel comics would have been thoroughly entertained the computer generation was fantastic visual effects were stunning we ve come along way since superman with christopher reeve the actors skills were superb especially robert downey jr loved all the humour chucked in these light moments were well placed at the proper scenes that being said to add just couple complaints as die hard marvel fan here is how marvel could have made this better movie and future movies 1 loki there could have been more original villain regurgitating an old foe from the thor film was lame there is so many choices that could have been used 2 thus speaking of thor this is not the real thor didn like the thor film and certainly would not give it the votes give the avengers thor in the comic book was much bigger and possessed more power and abilities think marvel should have used cgi technology with thor character instead of using real life actor they did great job with hulk so why not make thor with awesome physique and structure another little thing to notice actually my wife did is scarlett johansson the scenes where she is running is hilarious think she should have practised those scenes better because she looks like she just discovered her legs and their movement other than that it was an excellent movie since am huge hulk fan m glad they gave the spotlight to him with multitude of scenes ', ' m still in shock after all the delays and the wait this is what the fuss was about absolute rubbish worst marvel movie so far pointless movie is too long boring and treats you like an idiot don get me started on the accents just don expect the marvel magic you ve come to expect ', ' marvel should stop getting kicks out of this universe thing and start focusing on making good film with all their resources ', ' if you re die hard marvel fan you may like this but if you re looking for something to hold you over until the real players enter the game this isn for you average at best pass ', ' watched it for 15 minutes and then couldn anymore from all that great avenger movies to this can believe it for me it the end of the marvel cinematic universe the story is about nothing the writing is terrible would normally never do it but if had seen this in theater would have asked my money back everything is about weird color effects that hurt my eyes am sure if stan lee would have seen this he would not agree to be part of the cameo for the future of marvell hope they will hire some great script writers and go back back to the beginning the only thing liked was of course brie larson she could not help it to be in this disaster ', ' using indian songs references bollywood srk and all but showing it as pakistani wow didn know that songs used in this belong to pakistan and bollywood and srk are pakistani as well ', ' with show written and directed exclusively by women you would think they would have some women onscreen that you want to watch loved jj season 1 she was bitchy but clever this season all four female leads are unlikeable every one of them is overly emotional rash hotheaded and seldom rational the lone voice of reason is malcolm the ex junkie if man wrote this he be called mysoginistic found this inexplicable there is no villain and no character on par with kilgrave and without villain focus the story meanders between quests of the four main women each one essentially to find some wholeness it almost as if man wrote parody of what he thought female written super hero story might be ll get some flack over this view but know that am staunch feminist jessica story in the first season was compelling and refreshing the characters this time all seem one note and the story was real tough slog particularly hated the trite final episode but won say more for fear of upsetting the spoiler police but you ll see all the character redemption coming miles away and it all forced by unbelievable coincidence deus ex machina ', ' m not going to spoil anything or get very technical here don usually write reviews did so because this movie took me back to my childhood like no other movie did sure it not intellectually pretentious or groundbreaking from cinematic or storytelling point of view but it delivers perfectly the wit conflict adventure heart and sense of wonder that once found in my crazy uncle attic slumbering inside those weird looking and dusty marvel magazines populated with super soldiers handsome flying scientists norse gods green monsters and incredibly hot chicks in black leather are here as grew up somehow repressed the idea that there was no such thing as fictional happiness these characters will never exist and it sure takes suspension of disbelief to watch them run about but this movie reminded me of what they made me feel before girls party nights college taxes and other complicated serious things came along as the movie ended felt overwhelmed by the readjustment to reality as knew it in my young adult life watched this with my 10 year old nephew don know if that makes me the crazy uncle but it sure was great to be back in that attic even for while always knew hulk smashed now know he always will ', ' my children and was watched every marvel film and series to date except from the ones that are rated 16plus or 18 we just could not get into ms marvel the acting is extremely annoying and the script is bad this series has been rushed and would be surprised if another would be in the works feel free and give it go but do not put your hopes up ', ' feel like need prescription for ritalin after watching this perhaps the frenetic nature of the pacing is supposed to align with the main character adhd but it hard to watch it uses lot of what was going on with the holland spider man movies and spider verse but with less wit or agency for example the show accurately portrays the characters of modern teens like the holland movies and spider verse did which was exactly what disliked about those movies who would want to hang out with modern teenager for more than five minutes if they didn have to also this show reminds me lot of nora from queens the dynamic with the parents is similar and all the same immigrant cliches are there the wide eyed lead is charming if one note wide eyed the supporting characters are all sit commy and the villains are straight out of saturday morning cartoons while kamala background adds some new layers to superhero genre plotwise this feels too much like children show from disney channel that lucked out with huge budget ', ' the season 1 was great itself and the tone is carried from the whole marvel tv verse thought the acting was top notch the script was well put together and the story may not have been the most original but it was certainly delivered top class cant believe all the negative reviews here and m sure few must be genuine but many are surely by ppl tasked to write bad reviews recommend this series to everyone ', ' this movie was fantastic great writing very good action sequences while taking the time to tell story and allow the characters time to breathe darkly funny in places really good performances it well made and well directed has actual emotional and social depth without being self congratulatory ', ' they really need to stop hiring people who have no clue about the comics to make these movies its like making movie about the the book great expectations and never reading it so stupid shame on you disney shame on you ', ' like superhero movies because usually they have an interesting story unfortunately black widow is not among those movies and most certainly does not worth neither the time or money the movie was extremely boring with predictable story and full of cringy dialogues that made the movie successfully exceeds two hours ', ' story the actor retells his side to the story and it not bad but knowing that this guy was lunatic actor he became annoying production very good they put effort into this but after this this goes nowhere it was part of one of the worse mcu films so that not saying much main intelligence 0 for the people who he and people like him fooled highlight the production that about it this fake king is not an intriguing character should you watch this no it not necessary ', ' liked it wish they went more solo with it and made it more about black widow ', ' the marvels stands as cinematic masterpiece

marvel is triumphant display of her acting prowess satisfying the anticipation of fans like myself who admire her talent zawe ashton casting as loki wife is stroke of genius as her performance adds layer of complexity to the narrative teyonah parris as maria rambabu steals scenes with her compelling presence the film narrative contribution to the marvel cinematic universe is monumental offering rich tapestry of storytelling that expands the franchise horizons the ensemble cast chemistry is palpable creating moments of genuine connection that resonate with audiences in conclusion the marvels is must see for its perfect blend of humor action and nuanced performances solidifying its place as standout gem in the marvel universe ', ' it seems as though watched different movie but these bad reviews are written before the movie came out honestly think some of them are sexist just because the main character is woman and it the first one of the first mcu movies lead by female brie larson acting wasn bad either the movie is great and has an aspect of great humour to it this is really unforgettable movie with all its answers to backgrounds and stories about our favourite characters goose the cat was great addition to the movie the movie is great watch and is great timing to release on international women day this empowering movie is great for young women to aspire to with the idea of becoming pilot is for both sexes and sometimes the struggles women had with becoming pilot captain marvel gives lot of detail to what will happen in avengers endgame and the movie really wants you to look forward to endgame the tribute to stan lee is lovely and credit to marvel for the moving and emotional tribute the movie is also really funny and laughs were shared in the cinema they were not cringey or forced just genuinely funny the 80 90 music is great for those who remember them although cannot relate the movie is great and is great watch for everyone ', ' if you want to smile and feel joy because you love family faith and friends watch this show don write reviews seeing 6 1 is unacceptable when garbage like boba fett obi wan and hawkeye are rated higher than this this shows isn made for simpletons like the ones just listed this is good writing real story telling you instantly feel connected to all the characters no matter your background m not religious in anyway but love my family and this show really hits home best marvel show since wanda vision ', ' bad storyline bad writing and poor dialogues pretty disappointing ', ' more talk and less action turned it off after an hour if you re marvel groupie you ll probably love it but could not get into it ', ' the 4 first episode was good not better than loki or moon knight but like how marvel take some risk to put religion ont the show the actions was mid and special effect too but for relaxing this show is perfect ', ' ve long been fan of marvel from comic books to marvel cinematic universe used to believe marvel franchise will long reign however this movie makes me rethink my previous thought brie larson shows the false side of feminist she is an insult to both feminist community and captain marvel herself her acting is pretentious and boring jokes in this movie are lame and bad the plot is obvious from the beginning overall boring movie bad actor horrible plot what an insult to marvel universe ', ' the avengers is peak commercialism fusing merchandising and fun despite its flaws the script successfully paces characters and tension by restraining action early on meanwhile whedon humor is measured taking key threats seriously furthermore as the first crossover superhero film its gimmick was still novel yet it difficult to overly praise the writing because of its generic conflict convenient devices nonsense science sanitized action and predictability plus the finale doesn establish objectives spacing or tactics characters aimlessly run around artificially serving emotional beats therefore while the avengers is an enjoyable blockbuster its story is fallible on technical level the avengers is solid first and foremost its casting is king and paved the way for the franchise juggernaut next the soundtrack has an iconic melody yet is generally forgettable the production design is merchandising extravaganza yet is otherwise unimaginative and the sound is comprehensive with abstract touches the editing isn dynamic but blends plotlines and keeps the pacing tight the cinematography has energy and symbolic upside down shot lastly the effects are significant despite being obvious overall the avengers has cohesive tone and moves with purpose it not art but it landmark entertainment writing 6 10 direction 7 10 cinematography 7 10 acting 7 10 editing 7 10 sound 8 10 score soundtrack 8 10 production design 8 10 casting 10 10 effects 8 10 overall score 7 6 10 ', ' feel like just watched two hours of fight scenes and no real character or plot development left the theater asking myself what just payed to watch wrost thing marvel has put out ', ' ms marvel was simply captivating to watch the stylistic choices and representation throughout the show was undeniably astounding specifically enjoyed the way the show depicted online communication and typically hate modern technology being overly present in shows now was the acting and script throughout the show bit choppy sure but the show employed number of fresh faces that we re much needed action for the mcu who continues to employ unnecessarily large actors for the sake of attention russell crow charlize theron etc iman is without double the most interesting impressive and deserving actress not only is she diehard marvel fan but she also is so talented considering this is her first motion picture job if there anything to harshly criticize it the number of awkward cgi shots seriously what happened to using stunt doubles and for those saying it too childish hear you this is because the fan base for marvel pictures is primarily geared towards adult however marvel is making an obvious push towards young avengers storyline kate in hawkeye gorr daughter in thor america in doctor strange etc this show in particular was meant to be coming of age story centered on child so of course it going to be childish this show is definitely worth the watch and encourage everyone to have an open mind just because it different doesn mean it bad ', ' marvel started the mcu with it first movie iron man back in 2008 but up until that point marvel wasn really on the radar for good comic book movies failing with every movie they put out in the early and mid 2000s from fantastic four ghost rider the punisher daredevil electra the list goes on but that all changed with iron man and the creation of the mcu idea series of movies that would build roster of superheros and hero from the ground up giving the main avengers iron man captain america thor and hulk their own separate movies to develop their characters and story as the time line moved forward and finally after five movies and over four years of waiting marvel brought together the avengers for their first team up and while all the movies in the mcu before this had made massive profit and were loved by fans avengers assemble was marvels biggest movie success that broke box office records achieved stellar reviews by both fans and critics and even after all the movies that came after it avengers assemble is still to this day one of the best comic book movies ever made giving die hard fans what they always wanted from their favourite comic book characters and creating whole new generation of comic book fans that still continues to grow in 2020 really loved how the lesser known characters who were just cameos in the previous movies like hawkeye and black widow got their chance to shine and evolve in this movie for example in iron man 2 black widow didn do anything until the last 10 minutes of the movie and her character was very under developed same with hawkeye in thor he only got three lines and didn even get to fire single arrow at the time was worried this is what was gunna happen to the none superhero characters that don have their own movies but to marvels credit they gave each character appropriate screen time and showed off just how badass hawkeye and black widow can be and we got more character development and defined personalitys that make them the awsome characters they always have been the special effects and cgi is spectacular in this movie and really makes you appreciate just how amazing modern day movies with cgi and green screens can look when done right highly recommend watching this movie if your comic book and mcu fan even if your not and your just looking for cool action movie to watch it fun and badass ', ' one of the best directed american tv series some of the following facts that made me energies for this show are as follows 1 great casting see phil or maybe simons and fitz they really talk scientific there acting is natural and have to call may too her bold yet calm attitude fuels this show and the last phil coulson man you are just awesome 2 the direction and the projection of various parts and specifically some episodes its just amazing the way everyone script out dialogs the scene location even the bus yeah want one because its just something everyone desires 3 the screenplay the thrill it gives is much enjoyable than csi series or any other thrilling series guys it is the most awaited show and hell ya want season 2 to start soon till then kudos to agents of h e d ', ' initially didn like this well until 5th episode of season 1 and after that it really picked up improved season by season liked the characterization of punisher elektra karen foggy and ofcourse kingpin in addition to the hero daredevil punisher characterization had made me interested to watch his personal series next one on the cards ', ' m huge marvel fan and saw this film the day it came out in the uk with my friends who are also big marvel fans the first half of the film thought wasn even mediocre marvel film and the humour wasn funny that much however in the second half lot improved there are plot twists which made the film more exciting and interesting and the humour and storyline in general just got better do believe that the dialogue was very bland and that brie larson had lot of 1 liners think it turned into an average film redeemed by the second half and the hole it fills from previous marvel films oh and exciting post credit scenes to round it all off one of the best moments from the film is the marvel intro where they normally have the it flashing through mcu characters on the marvel logo but this time it was filled with stan lee cameos ', ' this is one of the best marvel series real happy to see this after the iron fist and the defenders no superhero stuffs but was really engaging the beginning was little drag but once you get into it after episode 3 it is real winner just glad didn read all those disappointing reviews by the critics before giving shot for me it is on the same level of lukecage ', ' how desperate is disney for original content that they ll edit old footage of previous mcu films rotating around specific character and slap on the name disney original the fact they call them episodes is bluntly insulting to the subscribers and honestly would ve preferred no new content rather than this joke incredibly insulting ', ' marvel the avengers deserves full credit for it dynamic execution in bringing the marvel cast together as it was very well structured and firmly put together blockbuster by the exciting character driven filmmaker joss whedon the clash and the interactions of each marvel hero and the development of this was exuberant witty and simply hilarious as the film progressed into the action tone and the all out explosive warfare in new york city the teamwork and building chemistry couldn be anymore dynamic and yet still humorous from whedon continuous comic relief of the combination of these contrasting superheroes although after all this popcorn fun simple but vital flaws remain the score of this massively anticipated marvel feature should ve had magical and intense sound similar to the lord of the rings or christopher nolan batman films instead the score failed to connect as it lacked in pure epicness and beauty and ultimately the film lost connection with one of the most important aspects in film not only did the sound and score of the film not work but the very simple story was exposed from the lack of depth in the telling of the story this ultimately made the film feel smaller and weaker than it should be with these small yet very important aspects of the film frustratingly not executed well instead of marvel the avengers ending on high note it ends having zero connection with the story and characters except mark ruffalo brilliant interpretation of the hulk because the lack of connection from the score and the lack of depth in the storytelling ultimately wore on everything else that appeared on screen what lack of connection in film leads to is forgettable movie because if film doesn connect and stick with someone how can that film possibly be remembered but it marvel the avengers how can that be forgotten very easily the concept won be forgotten nor will joss whedon incredible character portrayal of each superhero be forgotten but it will be the anticipation and the potential brilliance in the other huge motion pictures in 2012 such as the dark knight rises and the hobbit which will make the avenger be that film where everyone thinks what was that movie that came out earlier this year it was huge movie oh yeah the avengers how could possibly forget that it not because the film wasn good it was an awesome and intense blockbuster to watch but it was the little things that left the film slightly over par simplifying it down marvel the avenger was fun film and one for everyone to see and really deserves high praise for it execution of it characters although as glorious as it looked it unfortunately did not sound nearly as good as wanted it too yet the film is still easily likable to any viewer because there is so much to like about in the excitement of this film ', ' might have read some of the comic books as kid but don recall anything from them however watched the previous movies that were release which were of mixed blessing so didn really have any high hopes for this vigilante turned into series but it would turn out that was in for quite treat this is definitely one of the best marvel titles around why well because don like superheroes all that much but frank castle is not superhero and there is just something dark and wonderfully violent about this character and the things happening around him jon bernthal was really fitting quite wonderfully in this role and turned out to be great casting choice the series has lots of good characters and great that is helped along by some great acting performances all around and ben barnes was also quite good choice of the casting because he was so suited for the role of billy russo the story was good although it felt like it shouldn have been necessary to have used 16 episodes to tell it but still very good entertainment nonetheless ', ' having never read the comics but having watched plenty of tv over the years am qualified to say this is very very slow lots of people commenting on here are way into the comic book stuff and thats great for them but as tv show in its own right this is just plain old dull ', ' huge comic book fan sorry this is not captain marvel struggled to watch for 16 minutes chaotic odd intro poor direction bad writing the only audience is preteen girls jumbled storyline feel for the cast you cannot act without decent script one reviewer said samuel jackson great as always are you kidding it is not his fault that he did not have decent script but he phoned in that performance he has done work in number of marvel studios productions but not this time he had nothing to work with and he knew it his performance was i ll show up on time and clock out at the end of the day felt sorry for him ', ' what on god green earth did just watch how can this be 7 rated movie imdb is becoming less and less reliable every year this movie deserves 3 starts at best poor story poor execution and the main character saw less action than the supporting character black widow acted more as sidekick action nope think even comedy movies have more action than this ', ' omg had to quit watching the season finale 3 times and start again after couple of hours because simply couldn handle it anymore sooo unbelievably boring the entire series for that case only thing funny was the imam at the mosque at least he had humor so disappointed in this series liked all the other ones sofar really hope she doesn pop up in the mcu movies soon it would really ruin my view of those movies aswell am afraid ', ' after reading some negative reviews was pleasantly surprised it was very good ', ' admit season 1 is not good but it ain that bad season 1 sets up stories for at least 5 next seasons they didn really got good budget that a main problem but will say they are lucky they got the best cast the show is cool spy show with great gadgets unpredictable twist and great storyline but what makes this show outstanding is the characters from season 1 the characters you got they are no where near in end character development in this show is one of best have seen best example is leopold fitz he is so complex when watched season 1 didn thought out of everyone he will get the best development love everyone in this show especially fitz simmons daisy coulson may the original but the additional character are also great hunter and bobby mack yoyo and ward is like person you hate but you want hum around he was probably my fav villain in the show he hurt og more than anyone else loved to hate him season 4 is one of the best tv seasons by far season 4 will show ya what darkhold can do ', ' m incredibly surprised by the negative reviews especially the ones that think there is too much realism and not enough comic book in the show there nothing very real about what frank castle is able to survive throughout the course of the show regardless of his anger sense of duty compelling drive for revenge and general disdain for corruption no one outside the marvel universe has this much fortitude jon bernthal is perfectly suited for this role and am in awe at his ability to act with such genuinely raw emotion great actors make viewers forget they are watching someone fictional creation and pull them in to the point of making you believe that they ve experienced what they see on screen and bernthal achieves that and then some forget the comic book naysayers and if you want forget about the plot and the other actors although both are exceptional as well and just watch to see bernthal portrayl of man that has lost everything and will stop at nothing to ensure he completes his mission ', ' the biggest positive here is definitely iman vellani who absolutely kills it as ms marvel she well developed charismatic and likeable making me actually look forward to seeing her again the first two episodes also have decent premise with some entertaining side characters all complimented by the unique editing soundtrack of the show which is absolutely nailed however after the first two episodes the story slowly becomes more and more incoherent and non sensical events feel rushed and poorly explained whilst characters introduced at this point are either one dimensional caricatures or poorly developed nobodies the editing and style of the show is gradually dropped and just replaced by generic super hero tropes and dialogue whilst any intrigue generated by the premise is lost the show ultimately became boring and chore to finish by the final which was even more stupid than the episodes before it overall marvel had good thing going here but muddled it up bit there are definitely some good ideas and takeaways from this show but it a shame they didn pull the show off as whole d say to give this one miss ', ' after my second watch was better able to grade this movie when saw it in the theaters the first time was just happy to be back in the theaters after covid but left dissapointed now that have seen it second time over year later it was quite entertaining laughed during the comic relief and thought the story was good still hate the main villians lair its just not believable at all but the acting was good and so was the action wish we could have seen more of taskmaster but overall that character was good too ', ' this is the first movie in decades where wanted to walk out movie full of fast action great cgi but the actors were struggling to make it all work it had absolutely zero depth in the story it could have been so much more in the hands of better director initially confusing with the timeline unnecessarily jumping all over the shop as it did not add to understanding the directorial intent it was confusing the way it was handled in the first half with the explanation of the loose threads poorly delivered by the actors save your money the director should look at other movies of this genre for guidance like men last stand ', ' am big mcu fan and have been ever since purchased my first silver surfer comic in my teens out of all the movies the in the mcu my favorite was the guardians of the galaxy went into this movie with very high expectations especially after infinity endgame the plot seems intriguing however it was not executed well enough for such big budget movie like this the cgi was just ok nothing to seriously write home about the acting seemed forced the comedy was not funny at all the fake russian accents just made it worse other mcu movies have re watched more than three times this movie am not going to re watch ', ' this is movie for the brain dead have watched almost every marvel my kids love it and do too this was the most disappointing suspect covid had something to do with it but that no real excuse the action at points was good but it seem to have no depth to the character simply couldn see the sense in any of it guess marvel wants to make this into post covid cash and with the cinema release have no doubt the whole place will fill up and they will cash in but it simply not worth wasting your money unless you are just looking for night out and any film will do it feels like some of the reviewers on here are paid to shill this film won be surprised utter garbage ', ' it just really bad it looks bad and the story is even worse wish that it was more like the other marvel shows and interesting don really care about this girl and and the people they meet they just aren interesting m not invested at all ', ' grew up in the 60 and 70 this show reminds me of the crappy shows of the 70 ala chips the team 6 million dollar man manix et al you know schmaltzy only it lacks heart the show is terrible cliche predictable ridiculous too pc yeccch cornucopia of the mundane one act circus ', ' endless fights mass destruction of property mass robot villains and shallow characters waste of time ', ' this movie is stupid it random cutscenes of action with stupid story in the background everyone likes it because all of the super heroes are together which guess is alright but it just too much all of these comic book movies follow the same boeing format ', ' in terms of quality would compare the avengers to superman starring christopher reeve e absolutely no hokeyness whatsoever the story was superb the writing crackled with energy and the acting was excellent thought that that the pacing was magnificent suspense actually increased as the story proceeded and the perils became more and dire and catastrophic each actor and actress seemed to me to be utilized to the optimum not only in terms of their skills as characters but moreover in terms of their thespian skills thought that the movie was real tour de force sort of how to really do it beckoning sequels of similar high quality to follow hope was relieved and glad to see josh whedon make full use of liam hemsworth as thor something thought was sadly lacking in hemsworth first venture in portraying the viking god mark ruffalo finally gave us the first truly satisfying hulk since lou ferrigno even scarlett johannson black widow with ample opportunities to overact to ham it up utilized her minimalist skills to allow the audience to interface with the story in the final set pieces of the movie downey and others also played down what was roiling inside of the characters minds and hearts and souls allowing the audience once again to interact and participate as opposed to being dictated to or oversold on the emotions for fantasy and superhero movie that is quite feat not only does josh whedon deserve tremendous credit for that result but also jon favreau and stan lee among others the portrayal of loki was on par with shakespeare iago character who takes great glee in being purely evil ', ' way too much talk from secondary characters no one gives damn about the whole billy thing is dragged out endlessly we get it already do something or go away this season could easily have been 4 episodes shorter ', ' am on really digging the show side of camp the last two shows this one and moon knight really delivered refreshment mcu desperately needed but what really like about this show is how bluntly it rubs the nose with what not so ancient europe power greed did and consequences and of course show is going to get review bombed because hey geopolitics the thing though this was really very experimental and obviously poorly received but at the same time it hit the spot and revealed creative directions mcu is going for kamala is easily one of the more developed mcu characters along with steven marc the plot though definitely suffers from some crisscross and last minute editing and the pacing is unbalanced on the brighter side visuals and overall artistic vibe was probably one the best delivered blends so far in mcu so unlike marvel got to say they took liberty to departure from what we are used to in mcu half way through you can already tell this wasn meant to be 6 episodes format series and that can be hard felt when you come across holes in the story nevertheless was amazed at this show focusing on more crisis in real world than just the noisy ones and boy was glad lgtb was absent from it all together proves the point it doesn need to be forcefully shoved just for sake for it everywhere ', ' watched all 6 episodes the story didn go anywhere would better be movie with only 2 hrs no longer than that not attractive characters with cliche moment in every episodes mcu might have to reconsider about marvel series from now no need for woke just try to figure about the main character background and how to develop him her put any unnecessary stories aside from series please beg you marvel ', ' this is the worst marvel production to date the story lines were dull the acting was terrible except david tennant and the plots were god awful it took me several months to make it through this series because it was so boring but stayed persistent and tried to watch it but it only confirmed what thought about the first few episodes it was just terrible series there just isn enough action or enough suspense to keep you watching and jessica jones doesn use her powers enough if she is supposed to be superhero then want to see some superhero things furthermore several characters were unwarranted and redundant for reasons that are beyond me this series wasn canceled and was granted second season after the disaster that was season 1 won be watching season 2 step your game up marvel ', ' 1st episode set up fun family show that as good as any out there likeable characters some predictable plot elements that work well and hint at big events to come most importantly the show is compelling and look forward to seeing what coming up next ', ' the avengers is simply the epitome of how bad marvel and hollywood have become in the past decade if you combine terrible acting chris hemsworth as an example shocking green screen and massive clump of fan boy superheroes with hollywood eye candy you get the avengers joss wheadon career is now over whether you marvel fan boys like it or not the storyline is so poorly constructed that it lets you instead gaze in wonder at clich alien invasion clich bad guy and clich wonder device tesseract can say no more get over it fan boys mass of your favourite superheroes in one movie does not warrant an 8 2 rating hope you guys enjoy the sequel cause im not wasting my money on such garbage ', ' as huge marvel fan for many years feel more and more disconnect with the franchise since the end of the infinity saga this was the first film in the series actively chose not to go to the cinema and watch and m glad made that choice it feels like the writers director weren aware they were part of bigger universe there barely any connection to secret invasion which should have been very closely connected given the subject matter ms marvel annoyed me throughout the whole film the dizzy fangirl theme got boring halfway through the tv show and carrying it on to the film just added to the annoyance the effects were good in places then terrible in others in my opinion marvel needs to refocus on quality instead of quantity ', ' greatest series ever hands down netflix can kiss my ass ', ' the whole series consists of the punisher having flash backs and feeling sorry for himself and russo crying shouting and scratching his head because he can remember anything it extremely repetitive the actions scenes are few and far between and about as believable as the fight scenes in iron fist it worth watching if you re on very long flight and have nothing else to do stan must be laughing at netflix if this is the best they can do ', ' first and foremost when we watch the superhero stuff then we kind of overlook the acting part but not here this show has the best actors in it lead by charlie cox aka the daredevil and the supreme villain wilson fisk these two actors are the pillars of this show apart from that the action is so realistic that you would think that you can also pull it off and the rest of the cast supports the story and twists in great way you will feel connected to each character apart from karen page the season 1 was great and season 2 was okayish but wait the season 3 is the greatest all well that ends well ', ' m so sad that marvel is making these series bad acting and very weak plotline looks like one of those cheap disney shows which has nothing to do with marvel old great movies super let down we expect more from the mcu ', ' story line is terrible poor wesley killed by page he is master mind director made him in moment so stupid to leave loved gun on table and phone ringing at same time blind man hd knows the address and can go any where exactly it is terrible story acting is good ', ' just don expect anything extraordinary everything is just to entertain and as usual after watching superhero movies we ll ask questions like if she can do this why don she did it at the first time that a common question and just forget that question and smile leaving the theater just like the other marvel movies especially last few years seems that they are just not into the story but more on some events scenes special effects surprises and fun dialogue to make the audience smile and this time become more expecting some crosses with the bund of that blue furry doctor hahahah ', ' thought would have look at this im not major marvel fan and have found the films bit hit and miss but have enjoyed quite few of them am big fan of bend it like beckham meet the khumars and east is east although am neither muslim hindu or sikh for me this was just too cutesy tween drama for me the scenes with the parents found the most enjoyable the lead when allowed to just act was good but all the over exagerated cutesy face pulling grated on me the little cartoon interactions were quite good but the effects were pretty awful like 90s or 00s effects think they are muslim family but there was lots of general india pakistan culture on show there wasnt much actual religious chatter which was good think for the target audience its bit of fun was expecting something bit more young adult even though im nearly 50 find there is larger scope for me to find something interesting around that demographic this is way to cutesy for me to enjoy fully one for the kids for sure ', ' one word to describe this show marvelous let me explain why badass super heroin with elastic body kicking asses was all what people were expecting from this show including me but the show turned out to be very different for mini series what this show superbly achieved is how it introduces new super hero and totally different culture al together with perfection those who are still confused must know that the show is not about pakistani culture but the culture of pakistani community living in us both cultures are not the same although similar the story of kamala in is also not about fighting the evil but discovering her true identity so don prejudice before you actually watch it from multiple dimensions to time traveling the show has much to offer in just six episodes which makes each episode tastes different and fun so it is hard not to enjoy the show acting and casting is amazing including some renowned actors from both pakistan and india story telling is also great including some actual footage of the history which blends in perfectly with the main story even the end credits are used to sum up each episode perfectly which by the way are some of the famous songs in pakistan so go ahead and watch this show you won regret it and don forget to rate it kamala khan deserves it and you will know after watching this show ', ' with awesome special effects ahead of its time and great writing this movie is unique and also true to its comic book roots recommend it for anyone who wants to watch something great ', ' jessica jones was an amazon show that only lasted one season the trish walker power hour that we got 2 full seasons of was unbelievable frustrating to watch ', ' had low expectations going into this movie and still found it slow and boring this movie tries hard to reach woman and girls so much so that it changed the captain marvel story and made it boring very slow pace and does not get better as the movie unfolds too bad the captain marvel story line was good one the way it was ', ' predating shang chi and the legend of the ten rings after the events of iron man 3 trevor slattery is an infamous icon he is currently imprisoned in high security prison fortunately his newfound profile brought him fame and protection on the inside now slattery is giving series of interviews to documentary filmmaker but not everything is quite as it seems m glad didn watch this one before watching shang chi and the 10 rings because even though he appeared in iron man 3 don remember anymore and it wouldn make the slightest sense that cult lovely creative and short but justifies all his participation in both iron man and shang chi ', ' all the elements of satisfying movie were there but the timing on the editing is choppy and missing some important rhythm the dialogue sound and diction is difficult to understand at times the dark scenes lack the space of rhythm needed to understand what is going on in the action the emotional foundation for bonding between the three marvels is assumed rather than explained the water planet segment spent too much time on music and not enough time with the battle scenes enjoyed the ms marvel series and this could have been great segue the bad rhythm and editing made this movie remind me of cheesy dc movie not the quality of emotional breadth we are accustomed to in marvel ', ' alot of people are hating the first captain marvel movie included me but after watching the marvels changed my perspection on the captain marvel franchise no this movie isn the best but its fun to watch it feels like chill movie to watch when you are bored as marval fan it just feels so relaxed to watch cause there is not that much action in this short movie but thats good thing guess if they fit more action just to make the movie longer it would have felt like strech it not bad but it could be way better but have to say that kamala khan carries this movie alot in combination with the credit scene it was fun to watch but won rewatch it that quickly ', ' this show really sucked me in didn experience this since breaking bad was just so surprised after being so disappointed with the much hyped daredevil that never really took off jessica jones was pleasant surprise was going to watch few episodes and let my wife catch up if it were any good but no watched all of it couldn wait starts slowly but after few episodes it slams you with shocking turn of events the villain of this season is major drawing point and he freaks you out with abilities that you have rarely seen on screen really creepy and scary the supporting cast also fits really well into the whole picture just really recommend this show its not perfect but nothing is and the flaws are minor gave it 10 because it deserves it its so good that am afraid season 2 will never manage to live up to it ', ' incredible the actor is perfect for the character and when it happens as well as good guidance the show the perfection is reached ', ' m totally moved and astounded for the amount of work research and innovation in the production of these series yes there are immense differences when comparing with the comics but as kevin feige himself has said multiple times about many of the marvel characters they just don want to take the comics to the screen they want to elaborate on them make versions of them and they really took the chance to explore miss marvel and explore history and cultures which are completely misunderstood by most of the world population well done marvel ', ' top show love the characters great writing pulls your heart strings amazing experience from start to end 10 10 ', ' anyone who didn enjoy this film probably had their opinion made before even seeing it it was entertaining the acting was good the effects were great on fury and colson and the story was well done it made me laugh it made me think and it made me feel this isn meant to be an oscar type film it a great superhero movie meant to entertain and inspire people if you didn like it get over it ', ' creative style with some what of story just very slow and lacks substance eternals are an interesting group of species that all ', ' absolutely the best thing on tv right now the writers work is amazing the cast is pure gold the whole team is on fire damn we need more seasons ', ' m sorry but marvel is not like it used to be loved anything related to mcu and seeing now this makes me feel so disappointed this was not meant be it awful why why scarlett anyways hope this ends here with this one and we don loose that spark that used to characterize this kind of movies in loki words such deseperate attemp its pathetic ', ' the last movie of 2023 new team in mcu perhaps the most badly reviewed movie before it even came out just from the trailers of all the recent marvel movies this is probably the one that bored me little more m not saying it wasn watchable m just saying it was very average movie loved the connection and chemistry between the marvels as well as the combination of their powers in the fight scenes of course in some scenes it was as if was watching disney musical you will understand what mean for me we may be dealing with one of the most uninteresting villains in this film although liked the performance of the actress who embodies this character overall the marvels is just good movie do not ignore the post credit scene ', ' review from reel tunez the radio show all about the movies love marvel movies and black widow but this was yawn fest omg could they have possibly talked more is black widow new defense talking people to death with the help of her family now we re supposed to feel something for family that we learn about in 20 minutes this thing was sooooo lame and lacked excitement for most of the movie effects were good and visuals were as well but the story line stunk it was nearly as bad as taking an old waltons or little house on the prairie script and giving it to black widow and her family very disappointed ', ' good concept of story but very slow and boring though it would be better because many shows start off boring then pick up have watched few episodes and did not improve thought since it was from marvel it would be good but the target was missed maybe different actors would have made the show better did not like david tennant either loved him as the doctor but not in this show would like to know why they wanted him from the way they make kilgrave to be saw him as sophisticated man with abilities do not see tennant fit that role would think they would make kilgrave old enough but still youthful looking from the reviews know am not alone in thinking the show is boring shame on you disney ', ' ve enjoyed jessica jones with twists and turns coming in almost every scene you have to keep your eyes on the show add in the dysfunctional characters just like in real life people with superpowers fight and chase scenes and what more could you ask for in tv show so what not to love ', ' see some bad reviews here but it was good marvel movie with light sense of humor ', ' this version of daredevil is supposedly dark ooooh blood and gore yay so gave it shot love the marvel universe having grown on spiderman ironman and men daredevil has always been one of my favorites superhero my whole life ve expected and prayed for good renditions of my favorite superheroes but most of the time was left disappointed thinking oh well someone will get it eventually was excited when the 2003 daredevil movie came out but it was so disappointing and lack luster that couldn remember anything else aside from the main cast ben affleck daredevil who was in everything at the time and the late micheal duncan clarke the kingpin fast forward decade or so and m feeling excited again this time they ll get it right thought to myself got to say it better than expected and at the same time it not what expected it basically crime drama with blind visually impaired super hero and this time thank heavens they got actual russians or eastern europeans playing the roles of russians perhaps due to the fact that the co producer shevchenko is russian or eastern european himself at least when it came to russians they got the accents right other nationalities not so much ve watched every episode of season 1 and love the story so far love actress rosario dawson she could have tv reality show where dressed in her worst grandma sunday dress she plants daisies in her back yard all day and d watch it okay maybe not what prevented me from giving this show maximum rating is sadly the hyper violence yes it dark and gritty but watching person getting beaten to death for several minutes brings me no joy maybe m getting old maybe by brain is saturated with decades and decades of violent imagery if anything it sad and annoying just sitting there listening to bones get snapped teeth get knocked out for 5 to 10 minutes or long torture scenes most episodes have long brutal beatdowns matt murdock being on the receiving end of the majority of them that in all honesty bring no added value prefer when my hero is the one dishing out beatdowns up and down the street like concert flyers if the 2015 daredevil were the super hero d grown up with m certain d be institutionalized right now overall d recommend the show if you re fan and don mind repetitive and mindless ultra violence if you re new to the marvel universe or are casual follower d suggest start with the comic books first the story of matt murdock is worth reading ', ' having already starred in their own standalone movies thor chris hemsworth the hulk mark ruffalo taking over the role from edward norton captain america chris evans and iron man robert downey jr team up with black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to form the avengers team of superheroes operating under the command of nick fury of h e d samuel jackson who are called upon to battle evil asgardian loki tom hiddleston when he threatens to invade the planet with his chitauri army the avengers made an absolute mint at the box office proving to me that large percentage of cinema goers aren all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck written and directed by joss whedon the avengers assemble as it is known in the uk is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises an evil being seeking mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world this trite set up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no one suffers anything more than bruised ego an impressive line up of hollywood listers and the most spectacular state of the art cgi effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable clich nonsense told with little style coherence or originality ', ' just straight up horrible show with couple of good actors every episode their trying to teach you something about the history of pakistani indians and get it most of the cast represent that and it fine but they don realize their alienating everyone who is not pakistani and just trying to be entertained by this series there literally no action whatsoever on show it ridiculous its almost on the last episode and she still doesn have her costume on most of the time forget it even marvel series due to lack of action and wardrobe ', ' waiting for long time this movie but m so disappointed why so many joke it supposed to be an action packed movie with beautiful sexy natasha ', ' watched all the marvels films the first great others and bad including all the way back to blade enjoy fantasy sci fi or action romp also think it is important to go into every movie with blank mind because else you will just see the same people stories and setting over and over again the marvels is clearly aimed at different audience than 40 year olds like me who are still into comic stuff not like me so am not surprised that those old dudes give it so much shade but come on take chill pill captain marvel is not really the comic franchise to get upset about also like some comics some movies are just aimed at different audience would you get upset if they didn portray squirrel girl correctly but then who is it aimed at well clearly it is disney movie even with singing which was very cringy and they are aiming it at young teen female audience which could work in mom takes her 12 year old comic fan daughter to cute popcorn superhero flick kind of way which is fine of course however how many 12 year old comic fan girls are there out there really apparently not enough according the number of movie go ers and the few people in the theater was in did appreciate it though for it was it was all very very light hearted but it definitely had its moments of well done fighting scenes and some odd ball humor nothing tense with no real highs or challenging just set your bar to scoobydoo or spy kids the movie and take the kids ', ' if you asked fifth grader to come up with the plot for spy movie this is what they would have come up with another movie pumped out by marvel just for the sake of it extremely forgettable if was on flight and this was the only movie they had to watch it would be only slightly better option than starting conversation with the stranger sitting next to me ', ' only agenda nothing solid in the story no intensity whatsoever in the series even from the beginning the way it has been represented its very boring and seems like kid series ', ' being pakistani can say that didn enjoy and love the representation had really high hopes for the show being the first pakistani super hero one but its just mess rushed and nonsensical at times immaturely acted and poorly written had potential but led nowhere messy end to very very messy show nothing that would make you anticipate for what happens next only positive is the good representation of pakistan and good use of pakistani music ', ' black widow is spy thriller action packed film the first 30 minute on this was like non stop action because it action packed the whole film tells story about natasha 5 years ago about natasha going back to her haunted past now the villain wasn that great some moments in this film is very thrilling especially taskmaster it actually made the action scene look alot more thrilling the film is also like pg 13 mature with some dark tone this is probably one of the most darkest film in the mcu the action in this film makes the whole film like full with action well it not for kids under 13 to watch because the action does have some violence in it another thing that really love is the character the character is the reason why the mcu franchise is successful franchise the character backstory looks satisfying emotional with some thrilling moments and the family reunion was also emotional the whole film wasn too little it not too small the whole film is just journey for natasha going back to her past the villain doesn have any super evil plan now the way they tell story about natasha 5 years ago does feels kind of late but don really care much verdict 8 5 10 ', ' first off did like the show the story line was unexpected this should have been called the origins of the punisher was expecting to see him knocking off mob bosses drug dealers and gang members this first season focused on the punisher mental state and his marine background that drove him to become vigilante didn have problem with this but after watching the character in the last season of daredevil expected an different outcome violence was expected but there were few times where had to turn my head because of the gore the show is not for those with queasy stomach would definitely watch second season in hopes that the show focuses on one or two villains for the punisher to match wits and muscle give it an rating of 8 for the action story line and actors ', ' this is by far the most entertaining and great marvel knights that ve seen the only thing didn like is the weak ending the ending wasn clear and there was not conclusion ', ' wish could rate this movie 100 out of 100 have seen this movie twice in the theaters and its amazing it made me yell because the action was amazing and it made me burst out laughing in several parts lets just say was very vocal during this movie the acting is so perfect and the plot was also amazing the action was unbelievable and the effects were outstanding love this movie and have high respect for everyone involved in the making the incredible hulk was portrayed exactly as he should be just pure rage and outbursts of anger the iron man was super funny and really cool too as always captain america isn my favorite he kind of lame hawkeye is also very cool but wish he had an actual superpower like agility or something black widow is awesome but she wasn used to her fullest abilities in this movie thor is also very cool but should have been used little more in this movie wish thor would have taken down one of the huge monster things on his own he fully capable of it all in all this movie is must see amazing movie ', ' honestly skipped through lot of parts because was bored the whole time really enjoyed season 1 of daredevil it was interesting but this season seemed lackluster point dexter was the best thing about season 3 and he wasn even the main character that basically the reason continued watching it he made it interesting at times overall nothing much has changed been singing the same song since season 1 ', ' just can get enough apple logos on the back of everything electronic it really cool apple 10x the price for half the functionality one of these days should pretend m an idiot consumer and buy an apple product maybe need an apple robot girlfriend hmmm ', ' went in not having seen the trailer so maybe it my fault for expecting to see black widow origin story she 100 deserves one and this falls flat it takes place between couple past movies and had hard time keeping the timeline straight at first honestly didn understand the point to this movie as was watching it felt like filler only at the end did realize the whole point was probably to introduce another character who is hinted at becoming more important character in later mcu movies they really didn do black widow any justice hopefully she gets better movie in the future ', ' this show has always been rather good but the new season took it to the next level the kind of approach it using is something never expected from tv show the way characters backstories are incorporated into the show the acting and the action sequences it will blow your mind as much as love some other marvel shows now feel like they are 10 steps behind daredevil ', ' disney generated lot of hype for this movie considering that it was postponed more than once the trailer really got me and thought that marvel was attempting to make some kind of spy story there is even short quote to the classic 007 in the film but it doesn even come close to fleming work am always happy when company decides to make franchise flick about secondary character that may expand the narrative universe but in this case nothing is really added to the mcu and this was perfectly avoidable movie for several reasons the narration is below expectations natasha story is not really deepened if not for short intro that is clearly not enough to develop this character there are way too many shootouts fights and chases to the point where it becomes very chaotic and out of line the few dialogues are in most cases ridiculous tons of situations that do not make any sense natasha and yelena are human beings that received special training not superheroes nevertheless they are completely immune to explosions or car accidents they always get out with very few scratches and they always win with no much effort there is no tension no real struggling moments for romanoff family the plot twist during the last section of the movie is pretty much disappointing as always there are also tons of forced comedy moments that nobody asked for considering the 200 millions dollars budget the cgi is not good enough fire and explosions animations are awful the quality level of special effects in some sequences is comparable to the one of matrix reloaded which was released in 2003 seems like that there was no technology advancement in these last 20 years most of the scenes are over the top and completely unrealistic wonder who studied the physics and the dynamics for this movie because the job done in this department is clearly very sloppy black widow could have been different movie spy story with intrigues and more practical stunt sequences like john wick marvel here just went lazy and they lost big opportunity but they clearly do not care as this was in fact commercial success results may not be astonishing like endgame but they still managed to cover production costs so why even care about fans ', ' the avengers is one of the best films have ever seen it is action packed thrilling and full of amazing special effects the characters are developed throughout the movie as they learn to work as team the story line is excellent and the movie has you on the edge of your see throughout saw this is in 3d and 2d and have to say it is incredible in 2d but unimaginable in 3d also liked the development of some of the less well known characters and links made to other marvel movies there is also great deal of humour to add another depth to this immense movie all can say is very well done joss whedon very very good movie cannot wait for avengers 2 in 2015 ', ' have been marvel fan for years and was greatly entertained by the avengers movie so suffice it to say when this title was advertised months before its premier was ecstatic but then it did premier this is the worst show on television considering and yes watched every episode up till jan 7 hoping it would get better not when they first announced it was expecting squad of navy seal like soldiers with hero or 2 mixed in fighting against similar and formidable villains foes but other than clark gregg they give us boy band member who strips of his shirt every other performance and middle age asian lady together the 2 of them have very little trouble taking down hand full of armed bad guys while amazingly avoiding injury even when they are facing super soldiers who out number them 2 to 1 the results are the same the rest of the team consist of 2 british scientist and half asian computer nerd who has just joined the team having no combat skills to speak of but wait only 2 months after joining she is now able to beat down and subdue 2 security guards twice her size receiving not as much as scratch for are trouble this had such potential was expecting gi joe meets avengers yet instead we got 90210 meets agent cody banks boo this sucks and if could give it 0 would can not believe that you have people with opposing views on the matter then again some people are easily entertained if your like me you want show that represent brand that you have been fan of for years marvel to live up to its reputation this pathetic attempt fell short by far ', ' this show is amazing the fight scenes are spectacular and the acting superb the only thing would change is to make frank castle more of the anti hero its what makes the punisher so feared you are not safe anywhere think if there was real frank castle he would be the type of person who would have no problem shooting through civilian to kill 4 bad guys he would weigh in the benefits of doing so and thus consider it the greater good making him hero doesn due him justice imo ', ' am really disappointed after all this time waiting ', ' love this series and really liked the story line with mama jones trish is annoying though her story line was bad ', ' very lukewarm and silly movie looks like they just followed an easy recipe for an origin story also it looks like they fell once again into the trap of making it comic relief really hope captain marvel presence is somewhat redeemed in avengers endgame ', ' this was awful whoever is in charge of the marvel universe films need to be replaced the films have been getting worse and worse brie larson looks great as usual and the film isn overly long as some of the more recent marvel clunkers have been and samuel jackson is of course always entertaining other than that this is complete disaster from start to finish including drink and popcorn this cost me nearly 30 that could have put to many other good uses just giving 30 to the first person saw on the street would have been better use most of the people involved in this project should never be involved in another film if the world is lucky ll check to make sure don see another one if they re involved ', ' ve liked this series from the beginning but this new season has kept me glued to my seat there so much suspense and and so many twists can stop watching it and the villain is one of the worst ever you don have to be marvel superhero lover to watch this it the suspense and characters you become involved with that make you care about what happens to them you probably have to see previous seasons to understand the characters but it well worth worth the watch do not like the marvel movies but love all but one of the netflix marvel series they re nothing like the movies ', ' seriously how do people still get excited about these movies it the same old plot with the same old repetitive style of action sequences it not bad movie by any means but not great either it just average so average in fact that don remember very much of it except for good portion of the ending am still just genuinely baffled at how people get so excited for these movies they haven been interesting or unique since the late 2000s early 2010s the only reason saw it was because someone else gave me the tickets for free would have been upset if had wasted money on generic comic book movie 327 ', ' the movie was just ok m happy saw it but falls in the category of movie wouldn volunteer to watch again one thing that definitely dropped the ball with this movie is taskmaster they wasted such great comic character ', ' now in the marvel timeline this film takes place after captain america civil war but black widow really stands on its on you do not have to have seen the other marvel film to enjoy this awesome origin story of natasha romanoff russian spy turned avenger it is 1995 russian spies alexei shostakov and melina vostokoff go in deep undercover in ohio usa posed as family with with two young daughters natasha and yelena ages 11 6 they steal secret shield intel and return to russia but the young girls are taken by general dreykov and sent to the infamous red room and trained to be assassins my girls are toughest girls in the world alexei now twenty years later the very intel they stole is being used to control black widow assassins all over the world including yelena now to stop dreykov and destroy the red room the family must reunite and fight together but were they ever real family it was real for me yelena m sorry we had our orders and we played our roles melina black widow is my favorite of all the superhero films and it is so much more this is great well written story about unlikely family but with lots of action mystery spy and hero stuff and family feuds and reunions saw black widow on the big screen when it came out and watching again really forgot how good is way beyond my expectations and awesome cast some of my favorite actors scarlett johansson florence pugh david harbour rachel weisz olga kurylenko william hurt ray winstone ', ' pros strong independent female leading character her style charismatic british psychopath theme of abusive relationships is kind of being explored cons all the characters are totally cardboard ones they re inconsistent too too much of pretentiousness vs absolute lack of substance or interesting plot lots of moments that are downright laughable or cringy ', ' kids show can be for adults but seeing an entitled teenager becoming superhero just because she wants to can be fun for anyone the actions are mediocre at best and the plot just swings the ending was just bad being familiar with the culture they misused the songs so much it everywhere in the series guess that that they mean by cultural inclusion hate what marvel shows are becoming ', ' big disappointment come to india if you have run short of good characters you may find better ones in local streets than this one you have chosen as kamala khan ', ' 8 5 10 1 overall plot 10 10 the plot of this movie is revolutionary it is the first time bunch of movies have been combined into one like this love how this is mostly story of the avengers being created loki being the villain is super cool because it creates good avengers level threat like how they come together in one purpose and get the purpose of having something to avenge 2 entertainment engagement 10 10 this movie is very entertaining it is full of lots of cool action scenes and the slower parts with just dialog are very good still having all of these lovable characters from other movies together interacting with each other is very fun to watch watching all of the avengers interact and talk together is very engaging you feel more into the conversation 3 emotion investment in story 9 10 this movie has tons of emotion with the relationships that all of the avengers have with each other loki as the villain is deep too because of how we saw him in thor you get pretty invested in it and want to see them work and interact with each other 4 theme and depth of story 9 10 this movie could have lots of cool themes love the theme of unity because before loki attacks the city he attacks the avengers all individually he does this so they aren united and can work as team and it only once they figure out how to work as team again that they are able to fight the bad guys 5 characters 9 10 all of the characters are great in this do wish we saw more hawkeye being himself more think loki is great choice to be the first villain for the avengers love agent coulson and nick fury they are great shield characters and help with the creation of the avengers hulk is not great in this he isn bad by itself but compared to the previous hulk we saw in incredible hulk it terrible he looks not as cool and even sounds stupid 6 acting writing 9 10 all of the actors do great in this except maybe mark ruffalo just don like him as bruce banner he sucks so much compared to edward norton the writing in this is spectacular the allusion and foreshadowing to future events is awesome the set up of how the avengers get together as team is very cool as well 7 cinematography 8 10 this movies cinematography is pretty good love how the main battle is in the middle of the day it makes it bright and you can see everything super clearly just like the way this movie was filmed some of the action shots are very cool 8 score 10 10 the avengers music is so good it is on the level of john williams music the mcu has lot of good music and the avengers theme is one of the best 9 editing pace 8 10 the pacing is pretty good like how majority of the film is setting up and establishing the avengers as team really like how this movie is just an introduction because it sets up things like avengers 2 where it a true avengers movie 10 vfx practical effects 7 10 used to think the cgi in this movie was bad but after watching it again it not as bad as remember it still better than some recent mcu movies which is just sad that being said it still not the best cgi it a bit worse than the previous mcu films but not terrible some scenes are really noticeably cgi but some are still pretty good average score 8 9 10 my overall rating and final thoughts 8 5 10 love how this film is just the introduction and creation of the avengers team it set up for the next films to have some great potential absolutely love seeing all these super heroes interacting with each other ', ' marvel again swings for the fences and hits another home run great cast not perfect start but full of heart and fun once again different feel from other marvel shows with this one feeling more like coming of age movie ', ' disney do not let nina dacosta near any marvel movie ever again in fact don let her near any movie ever again this is clearly not gift of hers this movie was terrible the writing was awful the character development non existent the jokes were not funny could almost hear samuel jackson cringe through the screen the only saving grace was the special effects but even then one star because the rest was awful the acting was awful other than brie larson and zawe ashton and samuel jackson the rest should not have been in marvel movie should have let the team who wrote shang chi to write this the worst marvel movie of all time and one of the worst movies in general just terrible so disappointing disney let this happen ', ' bypass the acting it fine and it not there fault the plot holes are endless but most irritating is the power switch it a plot device of convenience and just have no idea why the villain dar benn has zero gravitas has zero presence and she just meh that the story of this film it completely meh it feels like poorly written mid season filler of film it not funny it not thrilling it not really anything the singing people that interesting to 10 year olds maybe this film just lacks purpose it lacks an audience and was the last straw for me disney is cancelled and sadly marvel is dead 5 of my top 10 movies of all time are marvel but that companies gone sad ', ' most fun ve had in long long time yes fun although this movie was just about 2 1 2 hours long it was so entertaining and engrossing for me that it seemed like about 1 1 2 hours the character development was good and each character was given bit of screen time to develop the character the action was good and not overpowering it only added to rather than being the main part of the movie the comic level was perfect not too much goofy stuff said just to try and get laughs every line imo was perfectly placed although ll have to see it again in order to hear some funny lines that missed due to the laughter in the theater by the way morning matin was sold out full each character was in character as we know them captain america was still the 40 guy iron man was still well iron man thor perfect the hulk super good best depiction ve seen etc thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it fulfilled all my likes for movie good vs evil and good kicking butt enjoyable fun time and escape good dialog good looking and pg ve seen enough violence and sex and love the break for some simple ol good times ', ' without doubt this is the best marvel tv show punisher hits hard and he does it with every bit of pain and every drop of blood you would expect m really going to hate disney if they reboot this without jon he as good at punisher as jackman is at wolverine don ruin good thing ', ' honestly didn expect anything from the series but saw the series and loved it loved the character the interpretation of iman vellani is great it is very fun and dynamic series love your editing very entertaining already want to see more of this character very good series ', ' this movie was very anti climatic after all that hype and build up the start was promising pugh was awesome in her role but the movie seemed to focus as much on yelena as it did natasha and it was supposed to be black widow own movie frankly found the movie bit slow moving and tedious at times the fight scenes were cool but nothing too spectacular the red guardian and task master were totally wasted looked forward to their fight but it was so anti climatic definitely one of mcu weaker offerings left the cinema feeling this was just another filler for the phase and kind of feel like bit of waste of 2 hours off to rewatch better mcu movie tonight ', ' actually take out time to watch this one they kept it real to the culture the dialogues the entire set up is realistic it so rare nowadays to get something perfect it like how everyone loved black panther and it became sensation ms marvel is killing it wanna see more ', ' it almost seems superfluous to add more to the mountain of reviews for this movie but that never stopped me before when was boy used to go to market stalls and buy marvel comics if only d kept them could retire rich man so far so normal but this was in the uk where comics meant the beano and dandy you couldn rely on collecting whole series of particular title in the 1960s it was just matter of luck what had been imported and was up for sale it was pretty much minority interest in the uk say this much just to make the point that have been fan of marvel characters for more years then would like to admit to and so fit that dreadful fan boy demographic from an earlier generation feel know the characters and know how they should be treated avengers assemble as it is known in the uk to distinguish it from beloved tv series of different nature is film that was able to enjoy as fan the characters were well developed and the interaction between them was particularly well handled and affectionate the action scenes were well handled though have some reservations about the not always impressive cgi that slipped through in places thought it would be too long at 143 minutes but was never aware of the passing of time whilst watching it and it did not feel like the marathon that some 90 minute movies can sometimes be some people have criticised it on the grounds that the plot is too simple and obvious or that the dialogue is too jokey but it fits the requirements for this type of film based on this type of material and what joy it is to have whedon turn of phrase and playfulness if you want to look at the underlying machinery then it follows the hero journey template like many most other successful movies except it has to fit all the characters into the journey it not the world greatest movie and it not art house but then it was never intended to be it good fun and delivers as much as fan could want mark ruffalo hulk was stand out for me the two previous hulk outings have been pretty awful in my estimation but this was pitch perfect and the hulk delivered the best laughs in the movie don really know how you compare an art house movie with blockbuster fun movie it probably can be done this was great entertainment and d sooner have that any day than worthy but dull ', ' did not expect much but the movie was good the cast was perfect and good humor ', ' love most marvel shows but their attempts to move to more rated material is annoying like many shows with mature content it ends up being just another show with plots centered around graphic sex constant swearing drinking and depressing characters they spend so much effort and slow down the plot trying to force enough adult material in and it frankly encourages bad behavior in the real life the difference in this show is there is just hint of super powers the jessica jones character is well acted but devoid of redeeming qualities and depressing to watch m passing on the remaining episodes ', ' as comics fan found this an absolute pile of hs unnecessary colours ans folklore ps am middle eastern so don mind folklore but it felt like the episode was just disney upgraded encanto with not as good plot and story origin not accurate though like the acting of kamala so will watch to see but disappointed ', ' the third season of daredevil still carries marvel netflix defenders and shows them how its done with compelling story character development and thrilling action dare devil series 3 in my opinion is the best season yet reintroducing the kingpin and bringing fantastic bullseye to the small screen the season manages to grip you tight and then smash you through window netflix would be stupid to consider dumping daredevil ', ' m not really into superheroes movies however really enjoyed batman trilogy of nolan nor into comics but people around me were talking so much about how cool the avengers was that decided to buy the blu ray 3d and give it try and it was big disappointment ok it entertaining it a blockbuster with lot of budget and special effect and action but the story is casual and predictable same thing for the characters really don get how people could have been so excited for something like that the worst part if movie so casual has that much success the directors of the sequels won make any effort to make better work on the story the second avengers movie did confirms that it was even worse but apparently lot of cuts where made because it was too long otherwise maybe the dvd br version will be little better of course not all the marvel movies are like that fortunately m open minded and love cinema so did try some other stuff the marvel studios made so can highly recommend guardians of the galaxy loved it and the ant man that was nice too the other marvel movies well let just say that if you don watch them you don miss lot ', ' the something fantastic about vigilante who wears black outfit and watch the streets of corrupt city by crime and seeks blind justice for evildoers no m not talking about batman but daredevil in his first season which is good reason for you subscribe to netflix in 2015 the actor charlie cox can carry on his back the role of daredevil followed by convincing vincent onofrio as kingpin the series has potential written everywhere from the structured script dialogs holding you the choreography of the fight scenes the sense of blood and brutality that exudes hell kitchen as dark place that needs actually be saved you keep asking yourself who is going to win in the war between daredevil and wilson fisk and who is really trying to save the city ', ' bad writing cringe the family conversations feel so inorganic and the dialogues in hindi urdu aren even pronounced right at times it simply just bad acting ', ' really cant understand those who say that is not good movie or it is the worst marvel universe movie yet captain marvel sow us lot of things that were missing from the marvel universe and explain lot about the movies we have allready watched nice movie with humor not that much but enough action and the start of the next phase of marvel movies post credit scene is just what we were waiting for ', ' thought marvel was into superheroes this show was pressured no just flooded with drama and culture far cry from any avengers properties these shows are getting worse and worse less and less action every series woke is not good look for the franchise that rowan the rights to captain america ', ' really wanted to like this have really enjoyed pretty much everything which marvel has churned out in recent years including their first netflix developed endeavour in daredevil which was nothing short of spectacular jessica jones is one of those lesser known marvel characters which allowed marvel and nexflix the opportunity not only to please the devout fans but also to reach out to many more through online streaming services obviously it has had success receiving many positive reviews and already being commissioned for second season but feel it splits viewers opinions more so than other marvel based shows was excited to start watching it and see marvel put forward strong female lead engaged in an interesting dramatic and twisted world of super powers but found myself wading through the series only to be faced with generic bland characters forced and dull storyline and quickly fading hope that the next episode would show any sign of improvement the acting of some characters simpson trish wendy malcolm robyn was at times cringe worthy m usually staunch defender of the superhero genre and will usually overlook the occasional plot hole pinch of poor acting or bad dialogue for the sense of general enjoyment which the show movie creates but this was quite tough watch most characters are only capable of showing one emotion or have one single facial expression through 13 episodes the formula of capture the villain the villain escapes slow motion flashback chase the villain is repeated over and over to the point of amazement when it just slaps you in the face again david tennant makes for an interesting foe playing kilgrave and the directors push kilgrave actions almost as far as possible without turning the series into slasher horror show although at times he seems to be going through the motions as bad guy he the highlight of an otherwise bland cast of characters but not enough to save the show in its entirety by the end of episode 10 had really given up but dragged myself through the final three hours just to see it through part of me questions why bothered but at least know for sure that gave it chance and still ended up disappointed m sure plenty of viewers will disagree with me and m glad they enjoyed it but just feel it fell so short of what it could have been ', ' writing needed improvement cox acting was very poor however vincent acting was excellent series lost the plot in second season but picked up nicely in 3rd season and seems to be finally on track ', ' brie larson was miscasted for this role and or was just phoning it in for this film the way she portrays captain marvel seems to lack any type of interesting characteristics and personality traits she as interesting as brick this movie provides little backstory for captain marvel when it does try to it just bunch of short flashbacks that don really add anything lacking any type of backstory makes this movie uninteresting it bad enough that the plot was lame but on top of that the main character had no character if they re going to make her super powerful they should at least give details about getting her powers and what they are it doesn really do any of that instead the film feels like watching brick ', ' the pace of the series is damn slow m huge marvel fan and the experience of this show sets apart from others but not in good way literally not meant for matured adult man ', ' this is surprisingly decent film m equally surprised by the number of downvotes here what not enough sex language and gore for the mainstream or were some folks totally unaware they were dialing into cartoon based movie this has good story good characters an actual lesson and was an enjoyable watch yes parts of it jumped the shark bit welcome to the realm of super heroes that tends to happen lot in this field after the recent plethora of cringe worthy superhero movies full of ultra violence and character assassination batman superman men etc etc it was refreshing to watch film that brought this genre back to its basic values ordinary people that suddenly have power and aren sure what to do with it the storyline never slumps it never totally ridiculous basic plot holds up the individual characters are actually well formed and thought out would have liked to see squirrel girl given little more awesome since she at one time managed to take out thanos but she just getting started in this one the writers very well got the ideas across of don abuse your powers just because you can don judge book by its cover don judge too hastily give people chance to redeem themselves ll take that kind of content over hyper action and violence any day not that there wasn plenty of action and violence in this it was just subdued compared to the general media these days am not big fan of saturday morning cartoon type fare but this one did well enough to earn solid 6 stars in my book would have been 7 if the animation had been bit better well worth the watch and good morality flick brought back the days when comics were less gratuitous less violent and had far better stories overall think decent effort ', ' scarlet johansson and co really try to make this movie work however weak story followed by even weaker one dimensional antagonists prove to be great anchor in what otherwise could have been an excellent spy thriller the acting is pretty great across the board although ray winstone is the exception here you can tell they are giving it their best florence pugh steals the show as yelena bolova the dialogue while bit campy at times is good for the most part there were only couple times during the film that cringed at an awkward interaction the only resource this world has too much of is girls bleghhhh here begins the fatal flaw of the film while the pacing is somewhat in control the story they are telling here is boring and by the numbers for standard comic book it has been quite some time since marvel had terrible villain but lo and behold ray winstone performance as the villain who can even remember the name of despite them saying it maybe 10 times in the film is up there with characters like kaecilius or whiplash while he does challenge the morals of our protagonist something most great marvel villains do it is given so little thought or time to explore that found it rather insulting he could ve been do much more impactful on this story there is also complete tonal dissonance understand marvel movies rely now more on their comedic aspects than their dramatic ones but healthy combination proves to be the most thought provoking and memorable here the film introduces humor at the worst of times with many of the jokes seemingly throwaway that could have been replaced with more serious moments given the darker nature of this films plot the story is nonsense with really no resolution won get into spoilers as still think people should see it given they are fan of marvel work but yeah the story end really felt like cliffhanger with nowhere to go again if you are marvel fan go see this film you might get kick out of it if you don particularly care about marvel films you can skip this one 5 10 ', ' they should have released this on nickelodeon to reach their targeted audience that they release this with 1ep per week is laughable no one will should subscribe for this 5 10 bc of it high quality production ', ' season 1 had everything you could have wanted in an action series there was plenty of violence there was little bit of sex and there was some great dialogue and ideology but then season 2 happened where is literally became rehashed parts of season 1 as well as full on soap opera with little bit of action sprinkled here and there season 2 was very much disappointment it too bad that it had to end this way ', ' guess m outgrown all the fond and excitement of watching mcu movies since endgame but then again maybe it was because this movie right here was painfully just bad ', ' now this is not thoughtful nor deep movie you see this movie for comedy with some action to sum it up this is buddy cop movie it is designed to be one so if you want good time or 90s nolstalgia watch this it is funny and enjoyable ', ' one of the worst marvel series ever made defenders was much better instead of investing money in such movies and not winning any interest of audience marvel should concentrate on defenders and it characters future of marvel doesn looks good characters that we lost are captain america iron man and black widow and if such characters are going to be replacing them then there is no use of watching marvel series didn even wait eagerly for any of the episodes after watching 1st one not just bad script but useless interpretation and more of an imposed character very disappointed to see this after watching agents of shield and defenders ', ' just go see it in theaters don let the haters form your opinions for you ', ' the fact that lot of things were taken care of lot of things were set up from the get go is what matters here give this show try with open mind and think of it like christmas special in the middle of summer and you will love it ', ' this is fun romp there are many things to criticize the mcu for and this film is certainly not exempt from them however it has sense of humor about it that is perfectly balanced with its plot it not boring waste of time like the last ant man movie nor is it two separate movies placed together like the last thor movie it quite enjoyable it does have few problems as previously mentioned the first problem is the mcu is victim of its own success kamala khan is an interesting character and seeing her family try to deal with ridiculous situation is quite entertaining but there are lot of marvel fans who just watch the movies and if you just watch the movie kamala just seems like an extra character added ridiculously to this captain marvel sequel but it makes lot of sense kamala is obsessed with captain marvel takes her name after captain marvel so she miss marvel which means she is someone who looks up to carol danvers as did her niece when she was little the other problem is the superman problem captain marvel is mcu equivalent of superman and like superman it is incredibly hard to create compelling narrative about someone whose powers are so overwhelming so in this film the question that asked is what happens if you have the powers of god and you make mistakes that plot is interesting but it a little overshadowed by the wackiness of the rest of the film which like said is quite enjoyable so if you re on the fence about watching this film give it chance ', ' there is so much cringe acting and its getting worse each episode tried to keep an open mind bur this is trash worse than new age cw shows religious basis of this series is more worse than imagined loved moon knight and other marvel series but this is like preaching religion ', ' captain marvel stars academy award winner brie larson as the titular comic book superheroine in the latest entry of the marvel cinematic universe carol danvers is first introduced to us as vers an intergalactic kree warrior trained to serve in the ongoing kree skrull war her journey leads her to earth circa 1995 where she slowly begins to unravel her mysterious past there as an air force pilot through her buddy cop team up with h e d agent nick fury carol discovers her true self and becomes the hero captain marvel first things first had very little expectations going into this movie largely due to an underwhelming marketing campaign nevertheless part of me also had sneaking suspicion that marvel were keeping their cards close to their chest as to try and not give away too many of the film secrets thankfully for me the latter proved to be true captain marvel is an absolute blast which comfortably triumphed my expectations this is true fantasy sci fi superhero action adventure epic which is exhilarating to watch and is sure to be real crowd pleaser it would be disservice for me to discuss the films merits without me commenting on the performance of lead actress brie larson was sceptical going into this film certain that she had been miss cast and would deliver wooden un interested performance couldn have been more wrong larson is fantastic and brings to life character full of heart humour attitude and strength the supporting cast are equally brilliant with ben mendelsohn clear stand out as skrull general talos like many feel mendelsohn has often been type cast in villain roles but thankfully here he is so much more than your run of the mill comic book supervillain talos is delightfully menacing but at times also wildly entertaining with many of the film best lines delivered by him samuel jackson of course returns as nick fury this time around much younger and more optimistic fury along with fellow mcu alumni agent coulson are welcome additions to the cast and provide much of the films heart and humour what found most intriguing was how the movie served to fill in many of the blanks that existed within the larger marvel cinematic universe of course that not to say you have to watch all 20 entries to appreciate the movie but there remains large number of easter eggs for die hard marvel fans to feast upon the film also has number of surprises which at times left me stunned without doubt these moments greatly contributed to my overall enjoyment of the movie captain marvel is far from perfect film however and there are certainly few elements that could have done without as seen in the trailers captain marvel is set in 1995 and the filmmakers go to every effort to remind the audience of that fact many of the film more comedic moments are derived from 90s pop culture references and feel extremely forced at times many of the films song inclusions are also odd choices that took me out of the movie albeit briefly going into the film had several concerns and fears for the movie that were luckily proved to be unfounded therefore strongly recommend to re evaluate your own personal expectations before checking this one out went into this movie with an open mind and can honestly say was pleasantly surprised that not to say that captain marvel ranks as one of the all time great comic book films it just isn i personally rank this one alongside other solid mcu origin stories such as doctor strange or captain america the first avenger on the whole this movie is one hell of good time that is sure to appeal to audiences young or old female or male remember to stick around for the post credit scenes fredonfilm movie

provides an entertaining narrative that will endear you to the characters new and old don let the runtime fool you this movie is packed in very good way the cinematography in the opening sequences particularly stands out as technical highlight as well as the new marvels score iman vellani shines in her stand out role and it is apparent she is having the time of her life particularly in the final scene of the film the film pacing is inconsistent at times but only pulls you out of the moment for few moments the villain is sadly underdeveloped and wish there was more motivation fleshed out but that is made up by the leads wonderful chemistry and dynamic together no doubt about it this movie had me leaving the theater wanting more from these three characters together believe it makes fine entry as the 33rd film in the marvel cinematic universe and gives you some phase 1 level all time marvel scenes hinting at the future of the mcu while keeping these scenes from overshadowing the movie as whole it a story that is part of larger universe and nothing felt like the scene was at the expense of the story of this movie this film is an absolute marvel see it in theaters ', ' of all the recent marvel movies which led to this film thought thor was pretty decent and the rest were blah avengers is arguably the worst yet the film reminded me of transformers 3 with constant explosions and destroyed buildings as well as ubiquitous 3d scenes which actually don look very realistic this movie is gimmick the plot is utterly clich and haphazard the dialogue save for few funny lines is very bad no great acting except for loki and he seems out of place among wooden performances even the editing was pretty lazy this movie seems more like tv serial with forced dialog the entire film is basically just vehicle to watch the different heroes fighting with each other ', ' big part of the popularity behind jessica jones is that the storytelling shifts the equilibrium between comic book world and tv drama off the line and into the tv drama side which can work when there is strong plot season1 unfortunately season 2 shifted so far from the spectacle of the super hero world you lose lot of the covering it provides in epic action sequences and memorable fight scenes when that happens you are just left with what the plot provides and unfortunately season 2 was so weak it actually undid lot of the great things season 1 did well the noir theme it built was dispelled when the mystery was broken halfway through and the grand conspiracy set up not only in this show but others was completely dilluted to the point where you wonder what was really the point of it all the great character development was widdled into one dimensional characters who were all eerily exactly the same and the drama was no more developed than standard soap opera would definitely recommend season 1 if you have patience and lot of time to kill you might be able to handle season 2 ', ' first season 10 10 second season 1 10 what the hell is going on with netflix first of all every single series that netflix makes is absolutely amazing in the first season only after that it turns into pure garbage but in order to make people watch the rest they invest in everything but the story they force atmosphere with music forcing the shows vibes too gory too much porn netflix why there is so much unnecessary gore and too much porn in your shows this is pointless it ruines everything for people that actually pay attention to things ', ' storytelling as an art what that and who cares anyway when hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies then where the financial incentive to make decent films 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades and have been going to the movies for over 40 years so that saying something for really bad blockbusters first hunger games next dark shadows and now the avengers am so sick and tired of new york city specifically the island of manhattan being attacked in the movies hello it was attacked in real life only little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3 000 real people including my brother co worker co worker wife and unborn child but what is really despicable is that at the very end of the the avengers you briefly get to see real life news photo from 9 11 mourning the dead that just plain disgusting exploitation but lets not stop there at the end of the film we get to briefly hear local new york state senator rant about how our avenger heroes wrecked manhattan that our heroes who just risked their lives in 1 000 ways are to blame for all the destruction fine agree many politicians are real jerks but to put the letter for democrat next to this senator name speaks volumes about the films real message democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful winy creeps that real cute thought hollywood was sooooooo liberal if you going to interject politics into film then why not put r for republicans after the senator name after all the republicans in congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of federally funded medical fund for first responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic debris that was released into the air the avengers is also plain boring with the most two dimensional characters in the history of film making sure wanted the good guys to win sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty but really now who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching frosty the snowman for the tenth time the last third of the avengers is nothing more than war porn will never watch another super hero movie that has character from the avengers as long as live even for free or if hollywood offers me million dollars overall hollywood has done decent job with the men and the fanatic four but for some reason the right wing kooks who control the avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine no wonder why stan lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film it just too bad he and the rest of hollywood has to stoop so low to make buck for those of you who have never taken film class in college before good film has an interesting story and actors that interact well with each other it really is not too hard to imagine you could even write it on the back of matchbook cover ', ' never followed the comic only know about black widow from the marvel movies 8 10 the first half of the movie feels like more talking with little action kind of like wonder woman 84 establishing relationships for heartfelt moments down the track the dialogue is funnier in russian english hits the mark few times would actually watch it again for these moments with these characters plus some beautiful scenery ladies fighting in iycra suits is good viewing the action scenes are marvel inspired ', ' hey have you watched the latest marvel movie in my opinion it the worst one they ve ever made it may sound harsh especially to die hard marvel fans but hear me out have been fan of marvel movies for long time and have watched every movie in the marvel cinematic universe mcu multiple times however the latest movie left me disappointed and unsatisfied one of the significant issues with the movie is its pacing the movie is slow and dull with little action or excitement to keep the audience engaged the movie spends too much time setting up the backstory of the characters which results in lack of character development the audience is expected to care about the characters without getting to know them properly which makes it hard to connect with them another issue with the movie is its plot the plot is convoluted and confusing with too many subplots and unnecessary twists and turns the movie tries to tackle too many themes including love sacrifice and redemption but fails to do justice to them the story is predictable and the climax feels rushed and unsatisfying the movie villains are also weak and forgettable the movie introduces new villain but fails to establish him as credible threat the villain motivations are unclear making his actions arbitrary and unnecessary the movie also fails to give the heroes worthy opponent to fight which undermines the entire premise of the movie the movie visual effects and cinematography are impressive but they are not enough to save the movie the movie relies too heavily on its visuals to distract the audience from its flaws the movie action sequences are few and far between and when they happen they feel underwhelming and lackluster overall the marvels is disappointing addition to the marvel cinematic universe the movie fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors the movie pacing plot and villains are all weak which makes it hard to connect with the characters or care about their struggles the movie visuals are impressive but they are not enough to save the movie from its flaws for casual viewers it not worth the time or money ', ' felt compelled to write review because of the low rating here on imdb loved this show ve been watching with my 9 year old daughter and just watching her face especially during the family and in particular the mother daughter moments swelled my heart these things are truly universal seeing my caucasian non muslim child follow kamala story with similar admiration and love kamala has for captain marvel is beyond beautiful and exactly what should be happening here every marvel film and show has had it own flavour or style and love that this continues to work so everything feels individual but linked to the wider mcu the finale gave me some serious buffy vibes and love the bit just after she suited up for the first time can wait to see more of ms marvel as my daughter would now say cosmic ', ' by far the worst movie ve ever seen and m not fussy ve never left movie review either but had to write this in the hope it will save someone from wasting their life watching it terrible special effects awful acting cringey jokes embarrassingly bad fight scenes and storyline if you can call it that to make you want to jump off bridge even if you were getting paid to watch this movie would still say no as it not worth the torture you will have to go through during the experience ve never left the cinema early before and never left review before but had to after this ', ' top tier show scott pilgrim crossed with spiderman homecoming highly recommend brilliant take on fan favourite comicbook character the build up was very engaging the dialogue was inspired and constantly fresh ', ' this answered the questions had about black widow back story had lot of action and introduced some characters want to see more of can wait for the hawkeye series ', ' the setting has lot of potential unfortunately after having seen season 1 and 2 imho it shows very bad scripting as the main character is incoherent hence it essentially felt down to another one of those much too many newest breed of tv series or movies which seem to exist only for showing pornographic violence maybe they thought that it would compensate for poor script along quite empty characters it actually turns down to detective storyline and very very poor one for that matter ', ' imo this movie is very generic over hyped and underwhelming the only purpose this movie serves is to have natasha pass off the black widow torch to her sister and they waste 2 hours doing so and in that time give us few seconds of dialogue in reference to what happened between hawkeye and black widow in budapest before this movie takes place after 10 years hyping it up with constant references the action scenes are all super generic as is the dialogue and pacing also to call the movie predictable would be an understatement if you ve seen few of the trailers you ve seen the majority of content the movie has to offer and can save yourself 2 wasted hours by skipping this and are better off waiting for the eternals venom 2 and spiderman no way home ', ' iron man captain america thor hulk black widow and hawkeye united against loki thor adoptive brother since 2008 marvel urged to produce avengers assemble movie started with the ogs this 2012 movie was hyped when its released glad was watch and saw the epic moment the round scene ', ' lot of fun action great seeing an effective team of heroes working together villain was clearly sociopath and her goals were clear movie has some cheesiness but come on it is based off comics the flerkens in force were especially hilarious the planet of song was pretty funny as well if you want fun family safe action movie this one is an excellent choice all 6 of us that went came out of the theater happy we had gone and looking forward to watch again ignore the people complaining they seem to have forgotten how to be happy with movie covid seems to have turned lot of folks into edgelord know it alls who really need to learn how to find something positive to say ', ' the avengers is clean burning six cylinder entertainment wall to wall action bonanza executed with fluid coherence it laughs in the face of expectation and instead sets its own bar that all blockbusters need to follow following on from the first thor flick the demi god evil brother loki deliciously fiendish tom hiddleston is intent on subjugating humanity with the help of an all powerful energy cube that ll allow him to bring his alien armies to earth trouble starts when this glowing cube of untold power called the tesseract is appropriated by loki who with nudge from his magic assegai brain zaps snap marksman hawkeye competent jeremy renner and top scientist into his evil scheme of world domination all that stands in his way is nick fury the ever reliable samuel jackson the head of the covert peacekeeping organization h e d who sets about uniting the world superheroes to avert the threat rounding up our titular team iron man hilarious robert downey jr the hulk subversively charming mark ruffalo thor the charismatic chris hemsworth captain america sincere turn by chris evans and black widow the sexy but earnest scarlett johansson hoping they will be greater than the sum of their parts problem is they re dysfunctional outfit with differences of opinion and troubled pasts and one of them is gigantic green loose cannon now with global catastrophe looming they must subsume individual will to the collective good but loki isn called the god of mischief for nothing before fury new super team can find its balance loki is in their heads sowing seeds of doubt distrust anger and conflict can earth mightiest heroes put their differences aside in time to protect the planet or is their coming together an even bigger threat than loki himself the avengers doesn buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast largely because of joss whedon he weaves all of the powder keg moments into story that is meaningful and always makes sense the point in the avengers is to bring six separate characters together as team without sacrificing their individuality and by extension their value as solo franchises and whedon does an excellent job of keeping the disparate personalities of his protagonists in play whedon script sparks up the exposition with some sparkling dialogue high stakes and balls to the wall action spectacle if you don believe me check out the thrilling alien bashing finale on the streets of manhattan it is pure fan boy wet dream smart funny pulsating and surprisingly cathartic joss whedon succeeds in appeasing its core fanbase from ambition to scale to the way it justly balances each remarkable character the avengers is utterly stimulating satisfyingly scripted and damn right faultless big screen entertainment the avengers make us do something increasingly rare in these over franchised times root for sequel go smash ', ' this was masterpiece of pure emotion and an enjoyable thrill ride that did not disappoint the cast chemistry was 100 incredible ', ' this might be the worst marvel show ever wandavision and loki were really good what if was interesting falcon and the winter soldier was medicre at best moon knight sucked and then this whatever this is marvel has lost its mojo ', ' to describe this movie in sentence is easy it marvel version of the fast and the furious it adds nothing to the mcu and was quick money grab to keep the marvel money train going rewatched this movie to really comb through every scene and every minute just disappointed me even more the only good thing about this movie is the red guardian character but that overshadowed by disney criminal decision to charge you extra to watch this subpar piece of work do not waste your time with this one ', ' ms marvel is probably the only hero can relate with teenage girl obsessed avangers and to some extent fictional worlds perfect kamala reminds me lot how was back in high school always daydreaming always imaginating some fictional world in faraway land mean reality sucks plus m muslim and woc so yes this show means lot was affraid that ms marvel would end up as one more show film where hollywood depicts muslims wrong creating ridicolous stereotypes that born from decades of islamophobic and orientalism hopefully this notion will continue till the end ', ' ok so let start by saying that was expecting to like this movie however what didn expect was to absolutely love it there action to the core as well as few belly laughs and and good time highly recommend it to almost everyone ', ' did not like the series much and one of the reason is she is fan of captain marvel and it still proves the she you even though the series is not good you can watch it for entertainment don keep any hopes on it ', ' ll admit that at first thought was not going to live that show looked childish and whatnot but to my surprised surprise freaking love it it fresh funny looks good acting is amazing and super fun ', ' opens strong with flashback and great action sequince than it takes huge dive in quality turns into mediocre action movie that is written around the action scenes instead of being written around the character red guardian is portrayed as an absolute idiot not just patriot no very dumb patriot for comedy purpose guess but it all just falls flat her lil sister is being set up as the next black widow yea we get it marvel you don want the money to run out and finally they ruined favourite of mine taskmaster is being reduced to mute with zero personality who just is there for plot reasons if we didn have the ms marvel movie this would ve been the weakest marvel movie ', ' it really good the story line is perfect and am never disappointed love the punisher marvel makes some bad ass movies shows ', ' really interested to watch this movie but got bored cause the movie is really boring like jessica problem was only kilgrave but it took her the whole season just to chased kilgrave and ended up with nada and it seems like she didn use her power well like she could fly or jump or whatever but she rarely use that power was just too bored to watch the season 2 what waste of time ', ' well that was big surprise the quality of the marvel character and tnetflix ware promising good outcome for us all the marvel admirers the result was far better than expected the actors were so carefully been chosen or by great luck that just fitted the original comic characters the story is more dark and cruel even when mc farlane was drawing spiderman except the 4 good characters the best of all is himself the actor that portrays the kingpin where has he been his is so great that thing that he may have some real problem in the future with his career he is the real kingpin what other role he can now incarnate my compliments to the producers the actors and world web that let us watch that great series even here in greece and hope that the show will be continued ', ' to be honest didn really know what to expect with daredevil it seemed interesting but was really hoping it would be good and thank goodness it is very good actually the acting is very good the writing is good the action is very good basically everything about it is good especially the villain wilson fisk he was one of my favorite aspects of the show it one of those where you actually understand why the villain is doing what he doing fisk plan is to ultimately clean out hell kitchen of all of the pain suffering and agony but he must give out pain suffering and agony to try and stop it you get to follow his life and learn about his childhood and why he is the way he is and why he does what he does it really shows throughout the season that he can be nice guy and can have bit of charismatic charm to him but he can also be brutal violent killer when the show follows him around and you start to get grasp on the fact that he an honest man and that he seems to want what best for the city you start to begin to actually like his character but then the show snaps you back into reality and shows you that he a 2 edged sword wanting to stop corruption and everything else that wrong with the city while he is actually corrupting the city as well the character development for all of the characters is great and the chemistry between matt foggy and karen is also very good and feels natural rather than forced for the most part at least the character of daredevil is very cool the way he does things and figures out how people are nervous or lying and the humor is good for the most part but can feel bit forced at times but not to the point to where it gets annoying overall daredevil exceeded my expectations but miles it really is great show marvel doesn look like they ll be slowing down anytime soon 9 10 ', ' this is hands down the best super hero movie made to date and ve seen them all at over 2 hours and 20 minutes it is wholly captivating perfectly balancing character development team development which is critical for this movie and eye popping 3d action this is no small feat bringing together the six heroes even the minor characters are brought to the forefront jeremy renner hawkeye and scarlett johansson black widow for example enriching their characters and making their action sequences just as cool and dynamic and surprisingly it is the best hulk movie there are two scenes featuring the hulk that will have you laughing so hard you ll be in tears you think iron man would have the coolest action sequences but when the hulk inflicts carnage on the enemies you don want it to stop this is josh whedon breakout movie no longer will he be known as the guy that made the buffy the vampire slayer series but the guy that made the avengers ', ' wanted to see this in theaters and m so happy didn waste my money cgi isn bad had some good moments mostly thanks to kamala khan the youngest one good casting there bad casting or writing for literally every other character wanted to like it but the story was pointless never seemed like anyone was in any trouble except the random alien people that they give almost no backstory nor present story for the villain was terrible and dont even know why not scary or powerful and seemed corny was waiting for the story to draw me in and get connected never happened unfortunately for free streaming movie it ok but was expecting more for marvel movie ', ' enjoyed this movie overall although will say think that it should have focused more on black widow and less on her sister ', ' ok if you don get it yet josh by gosh has totally hooked us up from the very beginning this film grabs your attention and never lets go gods from other dimensions aggravate the wildest earthling freaks available luckily amazingly powerful lads and some just good human with weapon widow and hawkeye hulk rules as usual thor vs iron man very cool throw in cap nice thor vs hulk greatest fight ever cap vs loki hulk saving iron man black widow vs hawkeye sexy hulk chasing widow thor spiral to earth hulk abusing puny god all iron man sequences when downy didn talk the new bruce banner is the best pure fan boy joy stanleerules fnord ', ' it has all come to this can movie starring several grandiose superheroes be good not only to comic book fans but to the entire world and they got one of the greatest filmmakers for nerds ever joss whedon it is very clear in this movie that it is whedonesque especially in it dialogue and jokes it all comes down to how the team gets together and the chemistry among the team is immaculate everybody on the team work well together no matter what pairing it is hulk and iron man black widow and cap thor and hulk cap and iron man notice that one name is missing here and that is hawkeye he was basically zombie follower of loki for half the film hawkeye in the final act is better but even jeremy renner knew that he wanted better storyline still though the entire team of avengers had incredible chemistry the villain loki was great choice for the avengers to take on he is formidable villain as trickster god with an alien army sure aliens were bunch of alien clones but they did prove to be good matchup against the avengers let talk about the final battle it takes place in new york which is great because that is one of the benefits marvel has over dc they take place it cities that we actually live in sure it is fictional but they still went by several places that people have actually been to it was amazing to see the team fight either in tandem or by themselves for 20ish action packed minutes that doesn mean don have complaints about the film as mentioned before it bothered me how hawkeye was used although he did get chance in the end to make his mark cap costume looked for like onesie and not something you would expect war hero and super soldier to wear the army might have been cgi at the end so it was just mindless action and one liners but when it is done this well you can really complain this is pioneering and spectacular film in it right it took something that nobody thought could work blockbuster film starring at least 4 larger than life characters that have only had their own movie and made great movie cast chemistry whedon writing and directing loki third act battle really small things use of hawkeye for some of the movie cap suit cgi army final score 9 5 10 ', ' this series always underpromises and overdelivers just when you think you aren going to like it it goes in direction that you are not expecting and pulls you back in before you know it you are on rollercoaster ride and you can stop watching the writing and the acting age like fine wine and by the time you are finished with season 7 you are just left with wanting more this is some of the best sci fi have ever seen on tv better than any star trek series and better than the mandalorian ', ' squirrel girl yeah wonder why squirrel girl was not in avengers infinity war please animated marvel bury squirrel girl where you found her and ms marvel too super heroes with powers yes but that too much don make joke of the animated marvel universe wonder how it would be if squirrel girl had to fight thanos what an epic fight that would be not ', ' sadly almost suspect that some of the scathing reviews left could be culturally ethnically motivated at least partially in my opinion none of the mcu streaming shows had great writing wandavision probably was top but they pretty much all had cringy dialogue plot holes and poorer story arcs when compared to the mcu films hawkeye the show pretty much was in the same league as ms marvel and aimed also at younger age group yet that got 8 imdb score this means most people score based on fandom and familiarity shows with those two boxes are checked get much easier pass know literally nothing about pakastani or islamic culture but found this intriguing people are used to the asian kungfu tropes european sorcery tropes african tribal tropes in comics and cinema now something unfamiliar comes along then no no no we must vote it to the ground sad ', ' pretty excited with this spin off from the mcu they dont showcase much on the street level heroes so having widow her on time in the big screen is must see for me street level heroes tend to be more realistic from all usual the power blasting fantasy like with punisher and daredevil my expectation is the story and action sequences should be similar to winter soldier applying the same street level formula of the mcu so thought well for the action scenes it was as suspected and that ride in budapest was for the books but the latter part or finale it was so so storywise wish they could have dig deeper to her time as an assassin and the red room darker given she an assassin felt more like family spy movie spy kids anyone it a let down making this your one of the few non epicn mcu movies s what the deal with taskmaster is she like an evil capt there are lot of weapons out there you know forget that tiny shield lol ', ' stupid fake russian accents shallow unlikeable characters bad writing plot is boring how come when disney can make the brilliant cruella and the mandalorian why are the marvel movies so brain dead ', ' watched only 3 episodes and it was torture iron fist at least had some interesting plot even like that the 4 shows were torture to watch watched them just because these days are lack of original and masterpieces shows like the oa breaking bad or dark so gave them try but marvel has to stop investing in crap characters like jessica jones or luke cage or daredevil iron fist is the only interesting character of the 4 and start investing in the best characters they have like nova vision galactus etc 1 10 just for the good acting the show is 0 10 the script and plot are 0 terrible ', ' pugh was amazing in this and her and johanson worked so well together chemistry was so natural between the two only wish there could be more of them in the future black widow has deserved her own movie for long time and they have done her justice here the action was fun and bad ass to watch if you re fan of the mcu you will love this addition ', ' the series is an attempt to build on the least fascinating almost mundane idea of an fbi like agency that exists in the wake of the superhuman stars of the marvel universe shield is actually somewhat of an afterthought an attempt of marvel creative minds to show that the us state and the human world in general are not insignificant ants in comparison to the more gifted characters we all dream we could be like well the plan was flawed from the beginning because this is exactly what they are insignificant trivial characters that lack any purpose and focus shield comes as child imagination of what being an fbi agent means and that child has been fed too many series on the subject already nsa ncis you name it but also has soft spot for the files in this case bunch of ridiculous but oddly happy characters scour the globe leaving huge carbon footprints with their big plane that houses bachelors penthouse inside go figure while doing that they never fail to exhibit their sensitive emotional human side and confront each other for no good reason usually while in the middle of super trivial mission or not so mortal danger all the clich apply in spades so we get mix of rebel macho dark and brooding asian newyorker computer geek british plus scottish accent boy they really overdid it there obviously the mix doesn work because you could be having this play in the background with the sound off and still not miss much the series don have anything to offer either as plot or as pure sensory pleasure not even special effects or sexy bombshells were employed to capture the audience this is why the writers had to resort in clever gimmicks like the name thor being mentioned at least once every other episode to make your head turn and look at the screen if you are so much taken by the recent marvel superhero movies that you are suffering from withdrawal until the next one hits the big screen then by all means watch this it will perhaps help ease your pain just don expect any kind of thrill from it for the rest of us it should be pass ', ' the marvels the latest addition to the marvel cinematic universe unfortunately stands as disappointing chapter in the franchise history despite the exciting prospect of bringing together characters like carol danvers monica rambeau and kamala khan the film struggles to weave their stories into coherent narrative the script attempting to juggle multiple character arcs and connections to the larger mcu ends up feeling cluttered and rushed the emotional depth and character development suffer amid flurry of action sequences that while visually ambitious lack substance the film use of special effects especially in key sequences is notably subpar detracting from the overall experience individual performances from the cast bring some charm but they re hindered by the disjointed storyline and lackluster dialogue ultimately the marvels falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors offering forgettable and underwhelming experience 2 10 ', ' what happened with the latest marvel movies did they run out of creativity why make movies that nobody wants to watch to be honest didn even bother to finish it at first didn want to be affected by the general review but after watching the movie users had every right to rate it so low bunch of kids in costume running around no big action scenes just small frames and lot of pointless talking they seriously need to do something major to gain my trust and make me watch another marvel movie rewatching old movies is more satisfying and enjoyable than wasting time on something like this ', ' the show is very good the acting camera work and art that is presented to us turns out to be very good mix the little added jokes bring you in little bit more closer to the characters feel like there a lot in store for us as marvel fans in this little show that going to grow so big while can wait for the next episode so that we can find out what happens next m looking forward for these review bombers to go away can believe they never really gave it chance as it sad to see but have prediction myself that would like to put on here while think that there is going to be an lgbtq relationship in the show that going to blow our minds with adorableness all we can do is wait and hope for the best well this show deserves way better than what people are giving it ', ' was expecting something more boring and was very surprised that really enjoyed it good fighting scenes conversations that made me laugh and am looking forward to upcoming movies with that sister of black widow is for sure not as bad as many comments suggest ', ' season one is good intense and with good plot however the second season just became kind of cheesy and the plot keeps towing time nothing really happen for many episodes the show got really obsessed with the psychological problem of madani and billy ', ' don blame the actors for this mess they were all pretty good don even blame the direction cause it had some fun and interesting visuals but holy cow was this show boring as hell can remember the last time fast forwarded so much through anything just watch recap videos on youtube and save yourself lots of time ', ' even if targeted at teenagers this is an insult to their intelligence you will find several key points on the story on this 6 episodes when things happen without any reasonable explanation at mage did it deus ex machina kind of level even more the series seemingly ends at the 5th episode the 6th episode feels like filler and at the same time like if they suddently realize that everything they did was garbage and that they need to change everything again without any decent explanation of course to prepare this mess for the marvels movie wouldn expect much from that movie either ', ' it starts well and considering the overall ratings for the series are so high you think it would at least hold your imagination boy does it fail terrible writing terrible acting from the lead actress the show is seriously disappointing given its strong beginning and whats worse its dull unbearably so in fact as the season crawls interminably towards its conclusion one just wishes the writers had put just little effort into character development that said its got budget and cool idea for plot just temper your expectations severely ', ' wow this show whas tedious and boring hard for me to admit that liked the punisher comics quite bit absolutely loved punishers cameo part in daredevil season 2 even liked the second punisher movie but the whole punisher show whas big let down for me the first season was allright boring at times and dont get it why punisher needed another origin story again but the action whas allright and the scenes between micro and frank where delight to watch season 2 felt really dull and uninspired in both seasons the pattern was always the same frank shooting goons grunting and screaming like baboon in heat oh boy they really turned that up in season 2 then he gets somehow shoot or stabbed and has to recover at least for the half of an episode while he is recovering he has usually bonding moment with his current compagnion then the cycle begings again and again and so on in case of season 2 the flawed story the pretty pale villians and the mostly uninteresting side characters could not add much more to make it less boring sorry ', ' this is quite possibly one of the best netflix series ever made easily the best when it comes to the marvel offerings this is definitely the first time that frank castle has been portrayed well he a multi dimensional character living through the pain sorrow and regret of his past he fighting with the demons of whats left in his life the punisher as portrayed by jon bernthal is an excellent and realistic rendering of marvel comic vigilante finally someone really took the time to develop character that we can relate to as human amazing show really worth every second hope this one will get all the credits it deserves it keeps on going with really good and fascinating exciting way of building up tension and is never boring everyone should watch this new top show my rating is 10 10 ', ' overall the film was enjoyable and straight forward natasha future death in end game does not reduce the stakes of the plot at all her sister yelena complex feelings is very well portrayed by florence pugh she has to switch between innocence and vengence throughout the movie and the duality of her character is the best part of the film the pose joke also made me laugh like how the outfits of hers aren hypersexualised for the male gaze taskmaster felt intimating and terrifying in the first two acts throughout the film m constantly intrigued however the film fails to meet up my expectations it is common knowledge that the movie should have released after civil war when we finally got her solo film it even got delayed for year additionally it was marketed as spy thriller action movie that resembles captain america the winter soldier aka the best mcu film perhaps it due to these premises that had my hopes up the plot was not memorable and the editing of the action scenes were sometimes confusing to me the third act felt poorly designed and predictable during the confrontation with the villain there is an obstacle that was dealt minute later with flashback scene it seemed very straightforward and childish scenes with black widow private contractor male friend also seemed pointless and dragged it another generic superhero film which the good guys beats the bad guys and this brings nothing new to the table darke serious tone would have suited black widow more sadly she had greater spotlight in winter soldier than in her own solo movie considering this is scarlett johansson last marvel movie it is more focused on others rather than black widow herself expected heartfelt emotional ending but instead we got an abrupt one enjoyed the film yet recall myself walking out of the cinema with disappointment 6 10 ', ' ve seen tv shows such as daredevil jessica jones luke cage iron fist and the defenders but this one is definitely my favorite great acting by jonathan bernthal which is really bad ass and also the story keeps you interested to watch the fights are also superb overall the tv show is really refreshing would really recommended this tv show so much better than the latest marvel tv shows such as iron fist and the defenders would give this tv show 9 10 ', ' this is joke of movie that far from funny can believe this movie gets 8 3 currently on imdb so this is on par with all those classic movies that score an 8 3 those movies that people will enjoy for decades to come m stunned how well this has been received anyone over the age of 7 that has given this film good review should be ashamed the absolute saturation of cgi is disgusting and seems to be enough to forgive the many flaws of this movie the action is as poor as the humor which is brutal m not against the marvel characters grew up with them know you can go into certain movies with critical eye all expected from my trip to the cinema was to be entertained instead was saddened shocked and bored to the point of irritation seen the amazing spider man recently that was entertaining the reason was because there was some thought and effort but into all aspects of the movie as it should be to the character and story it had everything that the avengers lacked ', ' by far this show is easily one of the top 3 best shows to come out lately the storyline is great the cast was ingeniously picked and since you can tie up the movies with the storyline of the the show gives it such broad room to grow that most shows just don have just gotta say good job people really good job but only time will tell because the pilot for this show could ve been better even though they made up for in the later episodes nevertheless it is still fantastic new show that me along with millions of people are waiting in the edge of our seats to see what will come of it and on my last note agent coulson livessss ', ' really enjoyed this show was great in any field actors directing screenplay soundtrack filming would definitely recommend it to friends who love action scenes and finally ask you to make the next seasons of this show because it is wonderful ', ' black widow is the weakest mcu film yet but it still good overall despite its multiple problems which are common with this franchise what should ve been swansong for one the original avengers is actually enjoyable but disposable prequel only really made to set up more projects it overuses cg that often looks weak and is very noticeable the villains are some of the worst in the mcu especially taskmaster who is massively underutilized and completely forgettable the humour whilst pretty funny occasionally constantly undermines the more emotional moments with frustrating results the action sequences are competent but nothing more however scarlett johansson gives reliably great performance and florence pugh is definitely the standout david harbour is only comic relief but he still able to make the cheapest jokes land the opening is really strong surprisingly dark and mature and promises way better movie when combined with the really good opening title sequence ', ' know it is actually two can play that game saying or song that is so no pun intended hopefully we finally get the three females as group together of course captain marvel had her standalone movie already but the other two are new to the cinema screen we got to see them evolve on the small screen and reckon kamala harris is the one that is able to shine brightest in this understand that some people are still feeling the highs of the avengers movies infinity war and endgame and it is true that the new movies since then feel bit disconnected or at least not as connected as the old ones you have to suspend your disbelief and just enjoy what they try to do here could point out that everyone seems to be speaking english no matter where or when they are from reckon no matter the planet universe or reality or that they use days and hours as system we as viewers can relate to but in space that would not make sense the movie is pointing out the up and down in space or rather it is made fun of but even that is only touched slightly then you have make up and hair in space not sure what the vastness of space would do to ones hair even to an individual that is as powerful as thanos or close to though with so much power would she even need the help of anyone else again you can nitpick lot you can question lot or you can just sit back put your feet up high if possible and just enjoy the show apparently this was way darker in its first iteration but got extensive reshoots have not read lot about the original version but there may have been connection to loki that does not really exist now that said thought the effects were fine the jokes were at least good some were even great again looking at you miss marvel and family and nick fury adding some needed foundation and grounding and solutions when needed there is darkness there is lot of loss of life or at least destruction but there is also light and there is another added bonus scene mid credit after credits scene none just some audio that reckon is funny touch but maybe not worth the wait in the cinemas if you watch it there if you are fast forwarding at home you probably will miss it due to you looking out for visual scene and there is none the story continues and there is lot to be discovered this is light entertainment nothing more nothing less story moves straight forward and liked it quirky humor and even the bollywood inspired set piece and scene did work mostly ', ' avengers is one hell of an action movie it is as good superhero movie as there can be it is an emotional hilarious robert downey jr and action packed superhero movie as far as acting goes its an absolute knockout by all the actors robert downey jr 10 10 executed the best lines in the best possible way or should we say his natural way chris evans 8 10 mark ruffalo 10 10 probably the most cool minded and seemingly not partially mentally impaired bruce banners unlike others portrayed chris hemsworth 8 10 good physique yet again apt for demigod scarlett johansson 9 10 served hot and dangerous jeremy renner 9 10 tom hiddleston 10 10 it takes some really good acting to portray the god of mischief really seemed to play with their minds samuel jackson 10 10 good as always the writing was great with some really good dialogues with punch two of the most outstanding scenes of the movie are towards the end first when iron man gets into his new mach7 iron man suit in free fall after being thrown down by loki and secondly when loki was boosting about him being demigod in front of hulk who breaks his trash talk him too just grabbing him giving good old bash to the ground dhobi pachad to knock him out this is must watch scene also is the scene where hulk stops the first big monster overall 10 10 considering it superhero movie it is the best there is now this movie has got style if not anything else so this is must watch movie if you don well you have certainly missed one ', ' as always she was acting her ass off and hope she in more things because she really brings another level to it that said the pace of this movie is so weird it starts at jog and never really calms down anywhere m not sure why people were surprised black director made black movie but racism exists and you have to ignore that honestly there were some cool ideas and it was mostly well acted it just had weird pacing and yeah think it would really help if the movies broke up and became their own thing again so they weren telling just part of story it nice to watch movie and feel like it accomplished something to feel in the middle of something definitely isn as satisfying ', ' ve seen series one and two series one was well written and entertaining series two was really annoying and stupid because they tried to make the threat too absurd if the writing was better it could ve been good but instead it was annoying and preachy and boring and repetitive and stupid d recommend watching series one and then stopping ', ' what fall marvel this series is total nonsense will suggest you to dont waste your precious time for this trash marvel will loose its name if they keep making films and series like this ', ' it hard to say how disappointed was in the first show m fan of joss whedon and comic book movies generally but this show tries to be too cute by half thick with references to marvel movies and their beloved characters which leaves you disappointed because you know those characters aren going to appear on the small screen the references serve as constant reminders of what is missing from this show it as if couple of disney producers got together to make tv show to demonstrate to other producers how you can destroy valuable brands not just marvel but star wars too all in one show the plot picked up where heroes left off bunch of irreconcilable stories with no place to go taken together all of these factors clearly displayed disney desire to exploit these brands without any respect for artistic development there nothing clever or new it entirely derivative bland and dull ', ' the last hour is lot of fun but found the opening chunk disappointing was expecting wall to wall action pretty much from the start especially given the forces that join together however felt the first half of the avengers as slow what also didn help is that the villain carried over from preceding mcu film isn super interesting we also don see the antagonist earlier film counterpart for fair few scenes which felt too delayed the last half is much better which allowed me to enjoy myself properly robert downey jr while not as entertaining as he is on his own brings goodness as do the likes of chris evans and chris hemsworth m not big fan of recasts though mark ruffalo as hulk is positive one even if that took bit away from the novelty of all the superheroes joining given we hadn seen ruffalo himself before added to scarlett johansson black widow at least in terms of the film franchise getting major screen time out of nowhere having been bit part character in her debut mcu appearance the music is noteworthy while everything looks brilliant overall and in short it a fun good action film just expected greater ', ' really love series like that but in the case of agents of shield do not its just endless boredomness with few replaceable pretty girls and some dudes flying on scifi plane and facing more or less wiered incidents the most times like 80 of the time they talk to each other about their feelings and about what great team they are when they are through with that they tell the same boring nonsense to other people around them no matter if this are other agents or the enemy the summarize of the real story of the whole first season is told in two minutes or sentences chemical powered superhero shows up big bad organization is behind that rich dude shows up who is somehow involved then you learn that the hardboiled agents are not that hardboiled at all and that nerds can be brave too thats basically it trade easily watching five minutes of doctor who against the whole first season of this show about agents on ecstasy talking drivel about their feelings btw am pretty sure the budget of that series was unbelievable low you see the plane two or three colorful painted paint ball guns as scifi weapons and few quadrocopters that are all gadgets they included every other gadget they show tablet laptop smart phone would have been impressive if the show where made in 1990 but now every 13 year old has this gadgets in his pocket when the superhero gets his hightech power suit whatever its something like black jogging suit if you are fan of scifi stay away if you are fan of marvel stay especially away to do not ruin you re marvel fandomnes ', ' after seeing so much acclaim and talk around this series decided to check it out and see what all the fuss was about so here our my honest thoughts on jessica jones couldn even get past how not good this show was in the episode watched the music and cinematography are pretty good m not denying that but found it not compelling at all more boring than anything else first of all do not like sex in anything movies tv video games etc it dirty it gross and my belief is that it a private thing that should not be displayed in media and this show starts off with that and then jones sitting on balcony watching someone do sex in window felt dirty watching this show and as we watch jones we find she drinks is depressing and broken and just scarred person who gives off disgusting vibe when your near this person cannot believe show that makes me feel dirty and miserable inside is such beloved show why do people praise things that are depressing and dirty don get it and then we go through seeing jones life and what she does and running from her past etc etc things that have been done in much better and smarter way when it comes to shows or movies these things are supposed to make you feel for the main hero care about them didn feel compassion for jessica jones did for agent coulson agents of shield and agent carter not jones though when it comes to anything that is acclaimed be mindful cause you make may regret what you see after because you ve been duped by it my rating is 2 10 m sorry just didn like it at all m not buying this acclaim and best show ever made garbage you want something that better agent carter the andy griffith show the wild wild west anything that makes it feel fun and love action and heroes being heroes ', ' most of you people seem not to like the movie but do lot also loved captain marvel which you guys also hated you need to learn how to watch movies from an entertainment perspective since most of you watch movies from the critics side of view you re never going to actually enjoy movies if you re doing that you care way too much always loved black widow and scarlett johansson and she fits very well on the mcu unfortunately her 6 movie contract ended and after the events of endgame don think we ll ever see her character again and that exactly why love this movie so much because it gives us an ending on her story and closure to one of the most loved characters on the entire universe also m not sure if florence is now supposed to take her place since it seems like every original avenger is giving the role further to someone else but d love to see more of her too she did not carried the movie tho that still scarlett also what makes the movie even greater and gives you goosebumps is the opening credits with malia s cover of smells like teen spirit which fits perfectly with the emotional story 10 10 loved it so much makes me wanna buy ticket to it and watch it again even tho just watched it ', ' was always aware of the show existance but finally got to see it now didn have high expectations myself just heard the show is dark which is something that really like in general anyways the show was big surprise for me really didn expect it to be nearly as good all of the important characters are written perfectly they get developed very well over time also the backstories help that for sure they are basically perfect charlie cox is perfect cast for daredevil you can really see his passion when it comes to playing this character rest of the cast is on point for sure especially the villains the story itself is very unique and full of plot twists as the time goes further not to mention how dark it is which is something mcu has been lacking on recenntly for sure also really like how the show is filmed it very visually pleasing love all 3 seasons almost equally they are all perfect takes on the show in my opinion looking at things objectively would give it 9 5 10 overall but looking at the show as whole m very thankful for its existance so it desrves 10 imo also rarely give 10s to any pieces of media so realky love it lot if you love marvel or just action shows with dark theme highly recommend it for sure ', ' one word amazing period joss whedon has done wonderful job the effort he and his crew put into the movie is overwhelming and evident ve never seen superhero es movie being so hilarious uncanny intelligent all together this has bettered all the previous incarnations of each character notably the hulk thor and captain america the script is one of the finest that ve seen in superhero es movie and so are the screenplay and dialogs the one liners are the best especially the ones from tony stark and oh how totally loved watching the hulk literally smash everything to pulp you know what this is just bs go watch the movie seriously no amount of words can take you to the level of awesomeness that the avengers set go watch it am for the third time this week ', ' normally do not pay attention to television since my favorite shows missing and last resort got cancelled but this is one that has got my attention to make me enjoy tv again it is show that follows agent phil coulson my favorite actor in the mcu and his team as the go around the globe doing missions for h e d and how they must battle the elements the show did hit few clinkers during it first 22 episode run with it being sometimes predictable and not very strong stories but after r c s ep 13 the show found it way to being super great show the crossovers between the films and the shows have been hit or miss with episodes like the well crossover with thor the dark world being terrible and lousy story but turn turn turn crossover with captain america the winter soldier did hit the mark and definitely had an impact from the movie do wish they more guest stars from the mcu movies other than fury hill sitwell and lady sif like jarvis or dr banner or hawkeye but maybe for season 2 joss whedon is one of the best at the business but do wish he had more of an impact in the show just so we can know he cares about it and is giving it the time from him it deserves the rating would give this show is most definitely 9 10 for many reasons it fun exciting great cast love the marvel touch only show that has my attention and finally having meaning in the mcu ', ' marvel knows how to their fans abreast with their storyline and ms marvel though is new to the game it references the older stories and love that the use of 2d animation helped old viewers to see what khan was fantasizing on which is captain marvel the rest shown to iron man and black widow was also top notch in all will say that marvel cinematic universe is genius franchise let them keep the story up my expectations for the remaining episodes is that there should be some appearances of the already known marvel characters in some sort will love to see spectrum or captain marvel appear ', ' really like this show but the earlier seasons were mich better it should have ended around 6 the last couple of seasons were not that exciting ', ' the show that wants to do everything and nothing at the same time first of all this show confirms that kevin feige does in fact hate inhumans and it is so disappointing to see they just changed her origin and powers and didn introduce inhumans in the mcu this way and went another route which won mention because it would be spoiler for the finale this show had decent start with some care that went into the editing of the first episode and it went all away in the next episodes because of different directors and even from the start it didn have that much of plot other than girl fangirls captain marvel and now she has powers they try to do lot of things but they do absolutely nothing with them the villains are the worst villains in all of mcu think of any forgettable and boring villain from the most mediocre mcu movie and show that you even forgot their existence and they are immediately 100 times better than the woman villain from this show not to mention that they are supposed to be these demon creatures but they all conveniently look like humans so their fight scenes are the most generic thing you ve ever seen like imagine if the souls of the damned in doctor strange 2 all looked like humans too or thanos and his henchmen were human too the show is mediocre but the villains are beyond horrible they also use all of episode 5 the episode before the finale of show that only has 6 episodes to give us history lesson and show flashbacks about the titular character great grandmother for some reason and that makes me feel like m not even watching show about kamala the show doesn really try to develop kamala character that much up until the finale we spent 90 of episode 5 with the great grandmother but that character and her story aren developed enough too and the episode is only 30 minutes so what the point exactly they want to give us history lesson but they won go into the actual meat of it and the gritty reality of it so it pointless and boring the acting is decent at least from the main actress but they spend so much less time actually developing her character that it feels like you ve gained nothing after 4 hours of it and you don really know her character at all plot progression and development is done horribly here and it is worsened by the god awful villains and their motivations and backstories dedicating whole episode before the finale to another character and history lesson like this is 5 season tv show with 22 episodes per season pretending the audience cares about the death of character they introduced only 10 minutes ago whose job was just exposition and making characters who ve just met act like they ve bonded as if they were on adventures for whole season while it was only 20 minutes in just one episode the story as whole is not that interesting either because they don present it in an interesting way like m watching the show and literally don care about anything they could ve gone with the inhuman origin which would have been 100 times more interesting and could ve brought agents of h e d daisey into mcu but guess inhumans are beneath kevin feige mcu and whatever this show was is better than them all in all it a rather uninteresting show and the worst of the mcu shows so far definitely recommend skipping this one and just watching the finale post credit scene in preparation for the marvels ', ' one that will divide opinion as it is yet another disney marvel production that chooses to err on the side of kid friendly and comedy than hard hitting plot and drama the big draw to this series is that another culture is explored in the mcu progressing from past attempts at diversity the context of the series is deeper than token race as another culture in this case pakistani muslim is central to the story it is integrated wonderfully the wider setting and context is rich and adds lot to the series the mother is great character perfectly executed by shroff slight stereotype but one that isn often seen on us shows it is cool to see another heritage represented with the south asian having strong characteristics to be utilised something that has worked well in uk series for years the father also adds well to the dynamics and the conflict within the family shows real heart at the base level of the show the origin of her powers is novel but the penultimate episode explaining lot of the backstory was weak and unnecessary nothing important was added that couldn already be assumed the overwhelming weakness for the show is that the villains are so underwhelming both sets of major villains are poor formulaic and dull and besides them there is the tendency to fall on the typical disney trope that any minor villainous character is stupid and incompetent there are further flaws mostly due to target audience appearing to appeal to those 3 at times the events at avengers con in the first episode are just daft whereas the last episode goes full disney and is more like home alone than anything previously in the mcu plus the use of drawings and animation through the series whilst different is very reminiscent of diary of wimpy kid which probably isn the comparison they were going for the cgi for the last episode is poor and in all the series is far from perfect but many of the characters are enjoyable and the addition of whole new walk of life into marvel is really refreshing ', ' this one was so good especislly the efast paste songs ', ' can remember when first came across h e d back in the late 60 in the uk in either the fantastic or terrific comics which used to get every week that h e d was the acronym for supreme headquarters international espionage law enforcement division now the whole world has discovered the word homeland ', ' saw this movie 1 hour ago on bluray quality of the disc is superb but the movie is not that good it a little too long think and is surely intented for teens kids mostly yes that is right unlike batman hulk 1 2 spiderman 3 this is for teen young adults this movie is not serious at all but it still good watch did prefer this better than transformers 2 however but for example xmen trilogy and last stand were way better the last 45mn of the movie are quite nice and explosive all in all decent but spectacular movie ', ' fun action packed superhero romp that you can watch with the family really enjoyed the ways the main cast interacted with each other also liked the humour and the action sequences it not the most inventive film plot wise but it a good time and lot better than some of the films that followed ', ' total time waste this is the most stupid show that watched there is no logic involved they hadn followed the comics everything feels like they are just pushing their political agendas can even believe this still has this much rating think it should be even lower ', ' where do even start with this mess let me start by saying ve been comic book fan since was child live and breathe marvel and will defend their stories and characters until the day die ve been able to find something enjoyable in every marvel movie to date until saw captain marvel this movie is huge mess it has wildly inconsistent tone extremely boring one note characters awful pacing and worst of all an absolute nothing of main character brie larson is so wooden and plain couldn take anything she said seriously and any attempt at charisma from her made me cringe for those defending her performance her character has amnesia she trying to figure out who she is allow me to point you in the direction of the bourne films matt damon plays character that doesn know anything about himself and was firmly invested in his performance from start to finish this movie insists on telling you how important captain marvel is without doing anything to earn it or demonstrate that to the audience aside from boring performance of boring main character there is the matter of the script that drags down whatever this movie had going for it captain marvel takes itself so seriously but provides nothing by way of tension or stakes it winds up being completely dull experience which is the worst thing colourful superhero movie can be the only thing going for this movie is samuel jackson who delivers his usual solid performance as fan of movies this film is really poorly executed and as fan of marvel was extremely disappointed on both fronts d highly recommend skipping this one ', ' scarlett johansson is always awesome as black widow no matter which marvel movie she is in wish the movie had been done earlier as opposed to after endgame but the movie was still very good as far as the action went and her sister who was likable as well there was one dumb car crash scene where neither of them should ve survived it but other than that it was good to sit back and have fun with most of the other action overall pretty good think ', ' this one will be one of my favorites have watched all marvel movies at least two times or more and this one was one of the engaging ones you have to follow it from the beginning to understand what is going on substantively this moves sets the stage for all the other movies it just came late in the line up true marvel fan will understand and appreciate this one it is in my top five ', ' please do not cancel the punisher we already lost daredevil bring us season 3 please netflix ', ' this is the worst mcu series ever very disappointed never expect these type of boring storyline from mcu movie or series its just for small kids characters are also boring marvel tried to make it interesting by adding some better animations but it looks like joke ', ' this movie is amazing florence pugh stole the show nat got pretty good ending also we got to know what happened in budapest post credit scene is connected to falcon and the winter soilder and also it leads to hawkeye series ', ' jeremy renner had to play in this movie natasha must remain dead making this film was both wrong and unnecessary it was better to use some familiar faces ', ' have always been batman fan liked daredevil too but frank castle kicks everyone ass the series is extremely well directed the action scenes are amazing and the character depiction for the punisher is great you absolutely fall in love with this anti hero there is no shade of grey in frank every decision is either right or wrong black or white he is strong both for fighting and his calls must watch show perfect for binge watching ', ' this movie is rated as an 8 8 at the time of my writing this and fully expect that to come down considerably now that all the fanboys and girls are finished pumping it up the characters could spend 2 hrs napping and the fanboys would still give this movie 9 or 10 it like that with any movie franchise those most predisposed to loving it are the first ones to see it and rave about it as well as overlook the obvious faults now that the rest of us are going to see it and review it that rating will reflect what the movie really is cgi fest that really kind of mediocre if it weren for the very funny moments that punctuate the film this movie would flat out stink it riddled with cheesy clich and seems more geared towards 10 13 yr olds than to adults really like iron man loved im2 enjoyed thor and was indifferent towards cpt america this movie was definitely the weakest ', ' really enjoyed watching the first episode cant wait to see the rest its slightly different from the comic book so love to see how this story develops the actress is amazing and love how they incorporated the pakistani culture so nice to see person of colour in the mcu nice reflection to the marvel comics ', ' really liked the show think the animations and comic character is amazing don want to hit any spoilers but the show is amazing it for everybody to watch not south asains only think now its time to watch something different and you will love this culture to be promoted cuz it amazing ', ' couldn care less about strong female whoever or racial what have you or trump america just want to be entertained god almighty but this show is boring absolutely nothing of note going on in it plot wise or effects wise or any other wise colossal waste of time and everyone effort ', ' when first heard of the idea to actually produce an avengers film was of course intrigued as the idea of making super team movie had never been accomplished before but the marvel universe films had all been cleverly inter connected and the stage was ripe for the avengers to be made naturally in film with so many list actors so many hero and so many ego the potential for disappointment was vast but m happy to say the avengers was thoroughly enjoyable the script is funny the action comes thick and fast and is choreographed much better than in any of the other marvel films and all the things you liked or cared about the characters before has been carried on very enjoyable summer movie easily living up to the weight of expectation ', ' starts off hot the fizzle and drizzles wait for it to hit disney plus on your subscription and don pay the extra 30 for 3 roll over disappointed to say the least ', ' after suffering multiple delays over the past year and change it fair to say the anticipation level for natasha romanoff first and likely last solo film was much higher than it should have been unsurprisingly the prequel did not live up to the hype the problem with black widow is it comes off as standard formulaic marvel film that came off the assembly line just to check box it true that scarlett johansson long ago earned the right to have her own entry in the mcu but the franchise could have gone on just fine had this film never been created david harbour feels out of place as washed up soviet superhuman not so much superhero and rachel weisz clearly did not show up for this gig to earn shot at an academy award the one bright spot is florence pugh yelena belova who manages to consistently nail tricky russian accent while effortlessly toggling between comedic one liners and tough as nails action sequences save for few impressive scenes widow is pretty dull and doesn feature any real fan favorites especially compared to some of the better received marvel entries of late it also clear that disney had to scrounge around in the couch cushions to find enough pennies to pull this together it just as well could have been turned into miniseries on disney given its quality lacking originality and coming so long after so many other films black widow is surely one of the lower tier installments in the mcu library still it worth watch if for no other reason than to check box ', ' what waste of time can image marvel mking movie like this it seems unnecessary forcefully done bad storyline uninteresting plot waste of so many talep only enjoyed the comim timing of david harbour failed attempt by mcu ', ' having followed all the movies of the mcu can definitely tell that with each upcoming movie series it getting harder for closure bringing the character plot back who we know has already departed as per the storyline these past sequels has started loosing the very baseline of superhero storyline as per my personal experience watching the movie was like watching the movie red sparrow yet again just with scarlett johannson hope that the upcoming prequels sequels doesn create up mess for the mcu mess which would get really hard to clear up ', ' too cringe guilty tried to enjoy it but nah only made it through 3 and half episodes props to ms marvel actress though she decent 2 10 2 10 2 10 2 10 ', ' there is absolutely zero chemistry between characters most of the scenes were awkward and weird very typical no originality whatsoever ', ' it much better than expected and it can be said to be the best marvel solo movie after dr strange which used marvel unsuccessful content to reflect new charm this should also be the first time that marvel heroes have discovered who they are and seek self awareness it has deeper meaning in the packaging of female subjects of course the most happy thing is lot of tribute elements the klingon people in star trek the flying feelings of aspiring clouds the subway pursuit of french drug network stunning glance at vulgar novel and third of file completeness very high and burning ', ' nothing fun in the episode 1 2 or 3 only showing cultural drama etc and new power from gauntlet with mystery bla bla bla nothing really intriguing after watching the 3rd episode guess the action ok too much cultural drama storyline to slow and the main character cringe and annoying ', ' an absolute disaster in terms of storytelling to be quite honest with you the only saving grace it had was how cheap the opening night tickets were watched it with my girlfriend boy do regret it the cgi work is good but some of it gives off power rangers vibes big time as for the acting it was horrendous infested with lame one liner jokes with no meaning or sense of timing the movie is full of jokes even during the critical scenes brie larson did good job with her acting but there only so much single character can do to save the plot lack of character association towards the audience was big downfall for this movie like who the hell is ms marvel and when did she join the team tldr save yourself some money it is definitely one of the superhero movies of all time if you still want to watch it d suggest waiting for month or so before it hits disney because this one not really performing too good ', ' this movie has no identity it never knows what it is trying to do and even does that poorly it is hotmess from top to bottom only kept watching it because wanted to believe it couldn really be as bad as it was praying that somehow they were going to put it all together then towards the middle just praying it would end after watching this abomination think marvel movies have sunk even lower than dc movies the concept was bad the plot was convoluted the writing was awful the special effects werent special and the acting was farce at no point was this worth being cinematic movie the only way for disney to save this phase 4 is to scrap it all together fire everyone in the room and let the fan boys have at it again ', ' just want to know who is responsible for mcus phase 4 and how he or she can still be employed there are 0 zero good movies and only 1 or 2 tv shows that are watchable over total of 20 productions and this is one of the bottom ranked ones marvel did fantastic job over the decade earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow don know how franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she hulk story is definitely boring protagonists are boring antagonist is boring action is boring battles are boring some scenes are absurd and ridiculous have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie don waste your money or your time looks like the movie is only made to make money in india ', ' the show was okay not great it didn really grab my attention like hoped it would would have gave it few more episodes if it wasn for the stupid flying corvette at the end it was just so bad and know that sounds like small thing to turn me off from the show but to me that just shows how cheesy they are going to go with the show my fear for this show is that it is going to become an ncis or csi show just week by week case with no depth at all witch is fine if that what you are in to but was hoping for something more or maybe just different this show has great potential but feel like it is going to be let down ', ' this movie was very triggering it made me recall the times in my life where saw movies that were not good the reason this was brought to mind was because this movie was not good other than as sort of cultural abyss into which to stare and wonder how things were before the kind of debased species that would make this sort of movie slithered into existence despite the fact that this movie isn very good it has lot of accomplished stars in its cast each of these unique stars brings to the film their own interpretation of muted listless performance felt samuel jackson performance was especially so his listlessness seemed mixed with deep despair an existential disdain so consuming that even feeling disgust would be comparative relief for him in the movie lot of things flew around there were threats of violence there was all the drama you expect in mexican soap opera there was even an animatronic gwyneth paltrow joss whedon has ingested hollywood gold and laid truly magical egg ', ' ok so imagine there is hormonal teenager who is having troubles with things around her and cannot get herself together and has drinking problem that a common plot but now imagine that that teenager is not teenager but grownup superhero from the beginning of the show till the end of first season jessica jones cannot get her act together she cries about the same stuff makes the same mistakes over and over again and you cannot tell the first episode apart from the last jessica jones is an endless continuation of very weak plot and an even bad character building for example someone is good and then is unexplainably bad due to some drugs they took there is no remorse acting has to be one of the lowest points of the show except for trish everyone including some accomplished actors were awful lastly don like the show because it is too dark and needlessly morbid don know it is cool to kill off people needlessly to make show intense surely we can do with less killing albeit they are just extras but still ', ' caught this one at the theatre and thought scarlett portraying russian named natasha whom is heroic was fairly great ', ' this is basically series about ptsd excellent show excellent writing but the violence is sadly off while the punisher used to be all about the satisfaction of revenge on bad people this show asks questions about war and moral issues that seem to be exclusive to the usa such as gun control love connecting to violence and war crimes committed by american soldiers that good of course mean truly talking about violence is something that is important especially if you connect it wrongly to love as only americans do the problem is it doesn know how to handle it this is about people with huge mental health issues not about punishment these people need treatment instead of revenge please don interpret my relatively low score the wrong way this is an excellent production the writing is fierce the acting fantastic especially the leads the cinematography top of the bill and the story is served like straight shots of vodka but the show just struggles too much with its violence it seems like the writers are taking such dark turn that they don know how to get out of it violence without moral code is trend in the us right now and dare say it reflection of its current society so love the fact that the show tries to tackle ptsd and other issues but for the rest of us whose ethics are still intact we are left with show that portrays violence without direction which leaves you feeling pity instead of the bad ass coolness that should be the punisher it too dark too hopeless period started to pity all the characters instead of connecting with them so can help feeling myself resisting its outlook on violence m fascinated think its daring but the show doesn know if it is about ptsd or about punishment ray of light here and there wouldn hurt and would be more realistic in the long run ', ' think the target group is between 10 16 think it good that it shows different family and culture but this series is so unbelievably childish and with so many cuts colourful and sometimes ridiculous moments even children of this age are not that childish ', ' it is either entirely predictable or very simplistic and rather easy to follow because called most of what was happening or was going to happen and m not proud of it but it is not annoying or bad wouldn call it entertaining per se and its certainly not story that needs to be watched again just like captain marvel was skippable marvel certainly needs to do better than okay if they insist of churning these out oh brie larson attitude benefits lot from sharing the screen with 2 other actresses this time around so she doesn come across as bossy or stiff with forced overly stoic personality everyone else was decent and laughed once can remember at what the villain is just huge excuse for adventure which is probably the worst part don think there much to critique or discuss as its vanilla flavor doesn give much to work with but people will only talk about the post credits scene so at least it has that going for it wait for the release on streaming ', ' really don get why it got positive reviews except from the beginning which was in some way interesting the rest movie fell flat it was the first time in my life that fell asleep on movie because it was boring at point where staring at wall seemed more interesting another aspect of the movie that was really frustrating was the feminism part the movie clearly wanted to point out that the director as well as the lead actress hated the existence of men it is crystal clear that brie larson wants to show to us tha she is above men because she clearly feels threatened by them to finish with in my opinion the movie lacked character development as well as making as the viewers care for this characters ', ' m part of the age group that this series is aimed at and still can watch an episode without getting bored and doing something else love how it shows religion but they make superhero story more focused on religion than actual superheros still can understand how they adapted her superpowers from being able to mold her fists and body parts into different objects to bangal to be honest expected more from you marvel ', ' am admitting right upfront that m being biased in giving this movie rating of 10 10 well to begin with this is quite good movie where the character development was phenomenal specially that of yelena played by florence pugh seeing scarlett johansson made me feel sad tbh since this movie a prequel to the endgame 2019 and we all know that black widow gone for good there unless mcu adopts the multiverse theory as shown in the what if series david harbour was funny and energetic quite good actually but the sole reason for me rating this 10 10 an unbiased rating from my perspective wouldve been 7 5 10 is rachel weisz k the most stunning woman ever period ', ' when loki and moonknight was announced wasn that excited seeing the trailers but it were absolutely amazing shows got the same feeling again after watching ms marvel trailers but then thought it might as well be good and gave it try but no just no it one of the worst series of mcu please do not waste your time watching the series hope they do not make season 2 ', ' love it the series is so nice and interesting to watch please people should not be hating just go try it out you will love it can wait to see more episodes ', ' what more needs to be said magnificent perfection daredevil the way daredevil was in season 1 before season 2 and the defenders went off track man that classic kingpin daredevil knock down drag em out in the last episode harkened back to treasured daredevil comics of my youth don know what it says about me that brawl warms the cockles but it did even more cockle warming the knock down between daredevil and gladiator replete with saw blades yes would have been nice to see gladiator in full regalia but this was fine just fine gladiator was always my favorite daredevil villain and almost shed nostalgic tear as he tossed matt to and fro loved bullseye too but it would have been nice to see him in his own costume instead of swanning around as daredevil yes know there some bullseye title where he does said swanning but that outside my comic book ken guess ll have to wait until season four oh right sorry ', ' wow if you are fan of the superhero or action or drama genre then give this show shot this is genuinely the best superhero adaptation since the dark knight everything about this show is great the writing is fantastic and the stunt work and acting are of the highest level and some standout performances from charlie cox as matt murdock and vincent onofrio as wilson fisk who kill it in their roles truly phenomenal show ', ' captain marvel is yet another in long production line of what call shake and bake super hero flicks its not bad as such you just have to accept going in that what you are getting is much the same formula that you will find with most other superhero franchise films this is good guy vs bad guy stick with lots of special effects and things going boom the typical drawn out chocolate box us folk sey thing was mercifully kept to minimum and something of twist was thrown in taken together this helped the pacing of the film and removed little of the bland predictability normally associated with this kind of fare there has been criticism of the acting from some quarters m inclined to disagree action sci fi films like this one are more about exposition which tends to limit the potential for actors to really offer up stand out performances samuel jackson as always provides some welcome comic relief as did the cat watch the film and see if you don agree with me in short captain marvel is what you expect it to be and what you get is to be fair quite watchable 6 10 from me ', ' 1 3 laughable take down the world dominator plot 1 3 awkward comedy 1 3 cringe inducing faux family drama the absolute lowest point in the lifespan of marvel studios and the mcu ', ' black widow is good movie for the return to the cinema marvel each time strives to deliver something different in phase 4 ', ' nothing about this season caught me off guard this season has been disappointing ', ' marvel did it well this year with black widow enjoyed each second action sequence story line performance all best ', ' had seen the reviews before watching so came with lower expectations and had really good time in my opinion the flaws lie within the first 10 15 minutes of the movie it a little bit rough but after that it has great comedic timing beautiful cinematography and excellent performances especially from florence pugh and david harbour all in all solid marvel film ', ' this superhero flick may have looked like gold in the trailers and merchandising but the real thing is bloated bland hodgepodge full of bad acting dull scripting and under average action scenes the only two good actors in the movie are robert downey jr iron man and tom hiddleston loki believe me think the lego sets based on the film are more interesting and the mini figure of thor is better than the one in the movie because he can talk hulk the actual green guy not the nerdy scientist has only few lines of dialogue bummer know don want to spoil anything else but don spend 40 seeing this film ', ' look get it representation diversity comon at some point it too much with each new episode get more and more of the feeling that this show is more about pakistani culture and religion than anything else and now with the latest episode they give us mini documentary on the partition look no one saying your culture isn cool but we re here for superhero story ', ' marvel is ruining all the great characters they have and they have very few interesting characters to begin with compared to dc winter soldier was ruined and now black widow since when is using sexuality bad thing james bond does it and it is practical and looks great china and lot of other governments use it in real life action and taskmaster was the most disappointing especially because it had so much potential change of director and writer would have done wonders huge miss ', ' it wasn amazing fantastic or great but fun not adrenaline induced not exciting not thrilling not funny but fun just fun no more no less what what else do you need watch it and enjoy it more the vibe of ms marvel than cap marvel set your expectations there after great for nerdy teen girls movie night or maybe father daughter introduction to the mcu think this movie is the one d be the most likely to casually watch again it a bit silly at times but liked leaving the theater not being sad maybe bit anticlimactic but on the whole it was fun good vibes kamala khan is growing on me ', ' really had little hope for the film from the trailer saw it and it turned out to be an action packed funny and original marvel movie ', ' hard to know at what point we are supposed to be interested in this movie slow and sillier than regular trying to force my way through the entire movie ', ' do not understand why marvel continues to choose the worst directors ', ' whoever gave the green light to this movie before its release needs to seriously reconsider their decision it astonishing how far it deviates from the essence of an authentic marvel flick it feels like it was crafted by someone who hasn bothered watching single old marvel movie for inspiration found myself thanking the heavens that this cinematic ordeal was mercifully short the disconnect from the established marvel universe is palpable leaving fans like myself questioning the direction it taking the lack of coherent narrative and underdeveloped characters make it clear that this film missed the mark by wide margin it disheartening to witness once beloved franchise veer so far off course if this is the trajectory marvel studios intends to continue count me out the magic and allure that drew me to the marvel cinematic universe seem to be fading away replaced by formulaic approach that falls flat it not just disappointment it a disheartening realization that the marvel magic may be losing its touch ', ' can get the marvel vibe from the show and it feels like watching disney channel the unnecessary editing and special effects make it appear childish had higher expectations for the show and feel really disappointed but it might be my own expectations that were too high after watching moonknight ', ' don understand the bashing of this who cares if she is islamic we are all something she is great character an great role model for all girls of all ages just relax an enjoy don worry about identity politics yes disney is pushing it however the show is nice show ', ' don normally post reviews but when people post bad reviews for such ignorant reasons have to the point of superhero movies is how fun it is to have different characters and learn more about who they become no 1 remembers how awesome it was when the mcu started this show won win award but man it is fun ride enjoyed it love the diversity as well need more of it tbh anyone who says otherwise clearly are the same spewing hate all around the world voting 10 10 due tu spam reviews bringing it done probably closer to 8 5 the fun alone of this show is worth watching ', ' found it very boring usually can follow movies but this one just dragged on and couldn keep my attention which is surprise because action is my favourite genre lot of family drama too which took away from the movie in my opinion ', ' as someone who has never seen marvel franchise film or similar thought d best give this try m an hour in and bored stiff there is nothing to this film that even remotely interests me and find it all action and no substance m obviously very much in the minority as am with star wars and other sci if films but this has done nothing to convince me to join the majority ', ' was hoping for series that delved into the creation of each character from the comics side who created it first drew it first appearance etc this isn it this is just collection of scenes and and voices from what already been seen in the marvel movies things we ve already seen and heard maybe expected to much was hoping for something fresh and new not rehash of what already know feels more like promotional tool then anything insightful or meaningful ', ' not bad at all if you can adjust to the old animation its pretty good only place could find it was ebay can believe it been out for like 30 years and has less than 150 ratings here ', ' ok so poor story line terrible back story for the villain completely over emotional it was essential super hero mexican soap opera d rather watch wonder woman 2 which was the worst super hero movie ever made on repeat than watch this again this movie has literally put me off watching marvel out dc cinematic universes and am massive comic fan boy ', ' so many problems with the story unsinspiring characters weakest villain the only 2 men in the film showed as useless even women characters were just boring to watch for me the effects and acting was okay but this movie was so badly written very disappointed but not as bad as captain marvel or ant man guess ', ' loved the first episode and am eagerly waiting for the second sure it was bit slow in few places but most pilots are predict this show will find its feet quickly and be great addition to the mcu it is about time that we see young female brown non christian enter the mcu face it the world is made up of many different people and the mcu should reflect this also loved the peek into her family life it felt genuine and real ', ' the marvels movie touted as blockbuster left me profoundly disappointed and questioning the state of creativity in contemporary cinema clocking in at an excessive runtime the film fundamental flaw lies in its inability to rise above the tired tropes that have become synonymous with the superhero genre from the opening scenes it apparent that the marvels movie subscribes to predictable formula the plot mishmash of recycled elements from previous marvel films lacks the ingenuity needed to captivate seasoned audience it as if the writers assembled checklist of superhero clich and ticked them off one by one resulting in narrative that feels more like derivative compilation than fresh engaging story character development cornerstone of compelling cinema is woefully neglected the protagonists are reduced to mere caricatures each conforming to their respective archetypes without any meaningful exploration of their motivations or inner conflicts as result the emotional resonance one might expect from character driven narrative is conspicuously absent leaving viewers with sense of detachment from the on screen personas the attempts at injecting humor into the script fall embarrassingly flat the dialogue ostensibly crafted for wit and banter comes off as forced and contrived instead of eliciting genuine laughs the film relies on tired punchlines and predictable comedic timing perpetuating the unfortunate trend of marvel movies sacrificing substance for cheap laughs the incessant quipping undermines the gravity of the situations the characters find themselves in diluting any sense of tension or urgency visually the marvels movie relies excessively on cgi spectacle at the expense of substance the overabundance of computer generated effects creates glossy artificial veneer that distances the audience from the narrative the action sequences while visually impressive lack the visceral impact and coherence necessary to make them truly memorable the reliance on cgi spectacle over practical effects further contributes to the film overall lack of authenticity robbing it of the tangible tactile quality that distinguishes exceptional cinema the film pacing is another significant issue at times sluggish and meandering at others rushed and chaotic the marvels movie struggles to find rhythm that sustains audience engagement the narrative feels disjointed with subplots introduced and abandoned haphazardly leaving viewers with sense of narrative whiplash the erratic pacing exacerbates the film already evident lack of focus preventing any semblance of cohesive and compelling story from emerging moreover the marvels movie falls prey to the pitfalls of franchise fatigue as the umpteenth installment in the marvel cinematic universe it fails to offer anything substantially different or innovative instead of pushing the boundaries of the genre or challenging audience expectations the film adheres rigidly to the established marvel formula resulting in cinematic experience that feels more like checklist of familiar elements than groundbreaking work of art in conclusion the marvels movie represents missed opportunity for the superhero genre to evolve and transcend its well worn conventions from lackluster plot and underdeveloped characters to uninspired humor and excessive reliance on cgi the film embodies the worst tendencies of contemporary blockbuster cinema while undoubtedly financial success its critical reception should serve as wake up call for filmmakers to prioritize substance over spectacle and strive for originality in genre saturated with mediocrity ', ' dont do it just do not waste your time the series are so bad same thing happens day by day he puts on mask at night goes out knocks couple people out comes back home hurt and next day he goes out again and fight exactly the same people he fought day before he has been fighting wilson fisk for 3 seasons all 3 season consists of him just beating paople same thing every serie just different locations and different fighting coreography wont even mention fact that acting was poor to sum up just dont do it dont waste your time if still decide to watch this series just watch first season you will know everything about this movie because first and last season is completely same ', ' let me start by saying that liked the daredevil movie quite bit know there are lot of haters for that movie but enjoyed it was it bit over the top at times most certainly but overall not bad in my opinion ve only seen the first episode so far but this show seems to take the best parts of the movie and strip out the bad gone is the cheesy leather costume replaced with simple black outfit and bandanna type mask which to me actually fits better with the character m not saying m averse to suit upgrade in the future but it makes sense that blind guy wouldn care how flashy his crime fighting outfit is there a trend in hollywood lately to make superheroes grittier and darker for some superheroes this just doesn fit for daredevil though this is exactly what the doctor ordered give it shot you won be disappointed ', ' it fair to say that the disneyfication of the mcu is near completion or may well be finally served by the near disaster of this film the saving grace is that its not anywhere near three hours long the marvrls centres itself around carol denvers aka captain marvel who has been burdened with destabilised universe akin to kree revolution whilst saving the day her powers are entangled with two other superheroes causing them team up as the marvels the problem is straight out the script for sequel there is really no character development and the story itself is rather thin to the point where you sit wondering where the whole mcu is heading it frustrating if you re lover of the initial phases of this marvellous universe sadly it hard to see if it ever coming back ', ' finally natasha getting her solo film little too late aftermath of the avengers falldown after civil war some nice action sequences florence pugh takes lot of focus she is the leader of widows now this movie revolves around lot of family dynamics love care trust although widows were poorly utilised in this all of this to take down the megalomaniac the end credit is interesting as to what people on earth think happened on vormir or the red room still operates still have to tumble that kingdom ', ' where was the superhero story the man of steel had better origin story and that movie sucked too the lack of acting in this movie was huge not just on larson but everyone how much harder could they shove feminist views in my face they built this movie around political views not plot tell story not political motive the only reason mar vell was wendy instead of walter was so that woman got her powers from woman not man they did not want her to be validated be man they just ruined the marvel universe it took the last jedi to make me realize that there was no hope for star wars m not going to make that mistake again wonder woman was better movie and it was dry but at least gal gadot could act start making comic movies for the comic fans and you will not fail there was not any wow factor in this movie except for wow they really made me pay for this crap really find it hard to believe that many males in her life were negative if you like this you have problems because there was no story here hope they don do this with black widow ', ' seriously this movie is really over rated watched this movie last week me and my friends drove 50 kms to watch this movie and all we got was boring movie the movie is very slow in the beginning and introduction of heroes didn give much effect unwanted extended action sequences and lots of unwanted dialogues made the movie dragging if the was movie little shorter with less conversations it could have been better movie anyway the end climax action was good but still if hulk was not there this movie could have been failure would say being huge fan nolan batman might have made me to hate this movie nolan changed the way of super hero movies he makes us to think and each dialogues or conversations have meaning or something related to the story its time for superhero movie directors to learn something from mr nolan waiting for the dark knight rises nolan ', ' very emotive take on the partition great choice of pakistani music and the family were shown in positive light no cheap stereotypes thoroughly enjoyed it ', ' it lacks the punch and its bit overly melodramatic ', ' the movie carried the same pace from the start to finish it wasn rushed or anything the theme of the movie was known from the start they also did great justice to natasha both scarlett and florence pugh did great job in acting there were few places that were out of place and unnecessary logic less but still this movie isn as awful as people are making it to be it like every other marvel movie ', ' it like someone else here said was watching some cgi and the then someone show up is there any one really writing this think from now on will just stop watching marvel ', ' find it very difficult to write review of superhero films the reason for this is what are they really other than the cinematic version of mcdonald meal quick and easy to produce look good fill you up but ultimately do very little that good for you only you don realise this and then repeat the experience hoping next time will be better this was fine it passes the time it got all the bells and whistles you ve come to expect from marvel film and this one has the ever likable brie larson in the lead so that elevates this slightly it not good though it fluff utterly forgettable fluff wish the whole genre would disappear quickly ', ' and clowns who are telling that it has indian representation it is not it is based on pakistani references marvel these days is too much on vfx miss the old spiderman kind of movies marvel used to make ', ' had originally put on the show just for background noise while did other things on my other monitor it was hard to concentrate on what was doing through the first episode and when the second episode started it had my full attention ended up binge watching the entire first season in 2 days amazing series hope they make season 2 charlie cox was perfect as matt murdock because had watched the old movie with ben affleck as daredevil years ago wasn expecting much with this show but after watching charlie in the role am totally hooked for other shows am always noticing plot holes and hate it when stories have no explanation for anything or give half fast excuses hoping the viewer wouldn notice but this show explains things perfectly with their flashbacks and they don do it all at once as to overwhelm the viewer love this approach it makes you want to watch the next episode because they usually leave you on hook ', ' love the marvel universe and the artistic vision that has been expressed in comics movies etc especially enjoy it when well written and executed stories find their way to the screen without being mired in excessive profanity and sexuality to me this shows either lack of intelligent originality or perhaps deliberate attempt by the hollywood crowd to desensitize the audience in my opinion no marvel story should ever warrant ma rating dynamic action anger and sensuality can all be tastefully expressed yes it takes bit more thought and creativity during the writing stage but the results are more than worth it so one star for not providing great and imaginative story that responsible parents feel they can share with the whole family ', ' m not really sure what they are doing here are they saying frank was in afghanistan and the army killed his family and he still hates the mob was this all covered in daredevil almost two years ago even with this confusion the show has been pretty good so far the murders have all been really gruesome better than most horror movies in the first episode he kills so many people with hammer that thought might be watching thor haven seen the whole season yet but the first few episodes are really good ', ' come on marvel you can do better than that hate everything about it black widow what her strength karate she not good enough for avengers watched and try to give it ashot but the story is boring ', ' know is marvel movie but black widow supouse to be human but in this movie she looks like she could easily beat up superman himself or hela and walk away unharmed next time they should ask jon favreau for help ', ' really cool can wait to see more after season 1 was disappointed of the news that it would be cancelled now they say the same thing again hopefully 3rd season is still possible cause this series has it all ', ' what waste of time this is one of the most boring shows have ever watched was so excited about this after the incredible work marvel did with daredevil unfortunately this show is missing everything that made daredevil great the story the excitement the fun about the only thing they have in common is the dark adult oriented style the plot is weak and the acting is awful found it difficult to even keep going just to see if it got any better it more like plain old bad private eye story than comic book style hero story m totally willing to throw believability to the wind when know going in that it a comic book film but it should at least be fun and exciting and this show just doesn cut it ', ' if you were into comic books manga as kid or like me still are you remember that feel you got get when your favorite character does something just incredibly awesome like knocking the villains block off that feeling is what this movie is built upon seeing your favorite heroes just doing awesome stuff upon awesome stuff over and over again the acting great the effects and feel you get when watching the movie in theater is close to unmatched this movie does just about every kick ass thing and more however this movie is no watchmen and no dark knight it doesn establish dark feeling and it far from deep storytelling and character development it is all about capturing our inner 12 year old fanheart and bringing them to light for while watch it enjoy it ', ' it a great marvel show to me it relatable love how it showcases brown girls and women on screen loved the wedding scene yes it might be little slow with some scenes but moonknight was little slow with some scenes and was overall great show think ms marvel is as good as spiderman plot because they are both trying to figure themselves out as superheroes think some people don like this show because they are racist or sexist or don agree with the religion portrayed in the show love the show even tho m young black american woman love how invested the actress is with her role ', ' despite the terrible vfx and complete lack of understanding of physics planes car accidents and gravity in general the writing is really the worst part the directing is an abomination and made worse by the fact that there was so much potential squandered really can say more than want those last two hours of my life back m kind of thankful though was going to watch bunch of films this week to get caught up on the new releases and this changed my mind think need to do more with my life than watch expensive vanity projects by certain rodent infested studio the actors were great though lol ', ' it the valley of tombs in remote siam john malcolm leads an archaeological expedition in search of the lost secret of the scorpion dynasty tal chotali is their guide local tribesmen fight for prophecy against white men in the valley despite the threat malcolm

mercury the group decides to divide up the golden scorpion amongst themselves this is an old fashion kids comic book adventure serial it divided into 12 chapters with each chapter ending in cliffhanger the story and production is all old style melodrama it can be clunky in that way the most impressive is the amount of big time action there are lots of fights and every kinds of action it the high end of republic pictures and one of the best of this genre in that era ', ' this shows seems like it going to be extraordinary such amazing and excellent representation of different cultures we commonly don get too see in the modern superhero world it was truly perfect beautiful cinematography attaching and humorous characters nothing more that could have asked for if your considering watching this you won regret it ', ' first the harley quinn shenanigans and then wonderwoman 1984 and then this was certain marvel would do better job but this is just undescribable m starting to doubt whether we should have stand alone movies for female superheroes ', ' the best parts of black widow are some of the early action scenes which involve fighting explosions mystery and sudden surprises they remind me bit of winter soldier how efficient the villain was however none of the rest of the movie lives up to those brief glimpses of potential the plot is far too complicated and uninteresting way too many characters are introduced without developing them the later action scenes are bloated generic incoherent and dull with way too much obvious cgi also fundamentally for this to come out after endgame and about 20 other mcu movies completely undermines it there is little or no tension since it a prequel nobody important can die for example there aren any particular gaps which needed filling in in the first place did not yearn for this movie it nice that black widow finally got her own movie but it came too late to mean anything in the wider mcu the plot barely holds together or makes sense it a mildly interesting concept but one which has been done to death black widow offers no real original twists on the concept it too far fetched to take seriously the main adversary is cool at times quite intimidating fast skilled and mysterious but he she wearing masked suit it hard to tell is not really developed another main villain is also 1 dimensional didn understand what was happening with widow family it wasn clear who did what or why like so many movie characters they barely communicate it seems to be obligatory that they fight lie and get angry in order to create drama prefer to understand characters and their motivations not just get annoyed at how selfish or manipulative they are or how lazy the screenwriters are unfortunately black widow feels like completely unnecessary exercise some of the action is alright some dramatic moments are decent scarlett is good and there some attempt at developing her backstory but it ultimately falls apart it changes nothing it relies on cliches it big and loud but not exciting and it too dark and serious to excuse its plot flaws and tedious over reliance on cgi ', ' never read the ms marvel comic but what saw in the first episode it feels like john hughes film his teenage films from the 80 i hope each new episode will keep toping each one the characters really come alive we really go this journey with them it shows that is takes place in the marvel universe but it seems to stand on it own teenage girl who idolizes captain marvel ends up becoming superhero in her own right but her family expects too much from her and where will it go wait to see in the next episode ', ' to put this opinion in context must clarify that m not marvel fan and not always in the mood for superhero movies but ok the black widow sounded bit different like she did not get some superpowers accidentally she supposed to be trained and dangerous and scarlett johansson is an actress that like so decided to watch but what waste of time the script is weak and with many flaws they don know how to flesh out the characters or provide thrilling story that is the little story that we get to see because for the most part the film is cgi action scenes and explosions and the black widow doesn feel as the protagonist of her own movie just passerby there is not much insight or development about her character she pouts and cries lot but where is the dangerous avenger another one who pouting all the time is rachel weisz she a great actress what did they do to her they could also enter competition for the most forgettable villain it is also tiring the need for inserting the superhero team in every movie aren there any other ideas they had an interesting story charismatic hero and good actors but nothing good came out of it so much potential wasted ', ' love this show really do butr seems that disney has other plans ', ' plot the structure of this movie is bit strange haven really seen any movies structured quite like this its not bad necessarily and don see any other way to structure movie like this but its still bit odd the odd story structure in this movie doesn take away from any of the entertainment but just wanted to point it out characters all of the characters and the acting is great in this movie sights and sounds the cinematography in this movie is great so is the sound design the effects are also great everything in this movie is very well done overall this movie is very entertaining the action is well choreographed the comedy is good the character arcs are interesting have no complaints for this movie it is very entertaining d recommend it ', ' this show is really boring bit too pc tired of always there being pc lesson in everything am all about unity among humans but want super hero show not this dull stuff not impressed sorry ', ' the first of the two most highly anticipated superhero films of the summer is here and it doesn disappoint the avengers more than makes up for the last few disappointing summer movie seasons we ve had don think ve had this much fun at movie since pixar up this two and half hour movie never fails to excite the plot is standard superhero movie fare loki tom hiddleston thor evil step brother breaks out of prison with the aid of race of super evil aliens loki proceeds to steal super weapon from the realm of asgard thor universe and threatens the world nick fury in routine performance by samuel jackson must assemble team of superheroes to combat loki iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans the incredible hulk mark ruffalo replacing ed norton the black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner loki unleashes his evil army on new york city and the avengers must do what they always do kick butt marvel was truly clever to give these characters their own individual franchises before making an avengers movie and not just in financial sense since we all know these characters already the movie doesn suffer from too many characters syndrome unlike another marvel franchise about superhero team marvel fans know what mean each character story continues in the avengers and it feels perfectly natural it is the chemistry of this cast that really makes this film work personalities clash until the gravity of the situation sits in and they start to cooperate predictably by the end of the film they are all friends but why complain it all in good fun given that these are really second tier superheroes in the marvel comics gallery sorry avengers fans but spider man and men are higher up in the hierarchy am amazed that they were adapted to film so well all of these avengers movies pulled off their protagonists very well but they have slightly weak antagonists and this movie is no exception loki is decent character and hiddleston is decent enough actor but he just doesn have the dramatic weight to match the power of the avengers review wouldn be complete without some description of the action as expected it fantastic from technical standpoint but it extra fun because you care about the characters so much maybe that just me personally could have used more bruce banner incredible hulk moments felt he was really overshadowed by the other teammates ruffalo was at disadvantage because he was taking over for edward norton but the incredible hulk scenes are great easily my favorite action moments must say this is probably my favorite marvel superhero movie because it just so fun it doesn need to get bogged down in character moments it is just shameless roller coaster ride so go see the avengers it is the first action flick of what looks like to be very promising summer for action movies and be sure to stick around until the very end of the credits ', ' when watched this show had low expectations due to the bad reviews but was pleasantly surprised by show with heart fantastic new lead ms marvel and unexpected intense action sequences wedding scenes and pakistani market chase reminded me of original indiana jones after first couple episodes which were more like disney family show loved the introduction of muslim characters providing new cultural perspectives in the mcu and new setting in pakistan this show gets better with every episode and m hopeful for more amazing stories building on this foundation ', ' wasn blown away but liked the movie overall even with the slow start think the casting was good especially florence pugh and there were some decently good action fight scenes the jail break scene was totally unrealistic but it is marvel movie after all if you want to continue the story line for the marvel cast overall this is one not to miss ve certainly seen some worse iterations of marvel characters lately ', ' the story is very basic with little imagination the action scenes felt forced the comedy fell flat also feel like you could delete the first 45 60 minutes of the movie with little to no consequences this gets 4 stars because it came out during lull in movies and they chose 2 smoking hot actresses as stars this is non pandemic 3 at best ', ' ms marvel was great show laugh lot of times the story is something different such as moon knigth and no one said nothing but it gives you the feeling of captain marvel scene don hear what the people say about the show is jusy annoying people who think that everything is like loki or moon knight if you don like go and watch flash and his 8 long seasons or batwoman and it 2 seasons iman vellaini is great actress she made great job and the rest of the cast is almost comic accurate even finding that some scene are literally scrapped from the comics books that was something that never expect ', ' watched all mcu movies my favorite super hero was black widow unfortunately marvel you couldn make this movie the script was awful really wanted to say goodbye to natasha in this movie but this movie was just high budget action movie don keep your expectations high ', ' an interesting marvel mini it was actually pleasant ', ' natasha romanoff aka black widow confronts the darker parts of her ledger when dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises pursued by force that will stop at nothing to bring her down natasha must deal with her history as spy and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an avenger the movie has somewhat good opening scene which will give you some expectations of being good thrilling action superhero film but you will disappointed the movie is littered with unnecessary jokes and melodrama you may end up snoring during the second act when it comes to the third act making production and vfx quality is heavy and you may find it interesting to watch but still it may fail to create significant impact on you the major reason behind that is due to the poor background score bgm should have the capability to penetrate into the viewer mind the entire movie is soulless and hollow ineffective direction cliche writing and crappy background score is what fills the major chunk of the film not recommended ', ' after promising first episode the plot is all over the place in their effort to educate the audience about partition and pakistani culture the story is just mess who even cares about the characters anymore red daggers clandestines even the exposition is boring and possibly the worst bad guys ever easily captured by ddoc and then easily escape from 2 whole guards supermax prison lazy writing with movie quality ', ' after sitting through few episodes of this complete drivel from disney am amazed that the show hasn been cancelled already the plot is basic marvel comic book fare with an origin story and developing characters but the pace is slow and filled in with way too many unnecessary filler scenes as if they didn want to spend any money on the cgi required to make it proper superhero series am so bored after three episodes that won bother to watch the rest of the series and hope the next marvel spin off is way better than this garbage ', ' the pacing is pretty good and so is character development the only thing don care for is the shape of bernthal head that was also my main gripe when he was shane in the walking dead ', ' had hopes so high that feel like just git the rug yanked out under me the show starts off with some cheesy like action and then some not interesting plot it not at all what expected and much worse really was looking forward to this show because love all the actors and they have done great in other shows in the past but bringing them all together in this boring show does them no justice will give next week one more chance hope am proved wrong please prove me wrong was hoping it would be like or similar to the actual avengers move but it completely nothing like it like the computer girl and the head of the agents they are pretty funny but everyone else has pretty boring roles ', ' breath of fresh air has been breathed into the franchise with this unique take on the genre it a perfect marriage of fresh poppy visuals and direction fun superhero capers and really interesting sub story about the partition family and the pakistani culture all with young female lead this is marvel for the modern age what ride no idea what the negative reviews are about m recommending this to everyone ', ' was seven years old when saw this serial in theater in 1941 now own 49 titles of republic serials mostly tapes and few on dvd this serial is my favorite for those who have not saw this serial won give away any secrets the plot concerns group of scientists and an ancient artifact with lenses that can turn any matter to gold thus the owner could rule the world mortal billy batson is given the power to become captain marvel the captain fights the arch villain the scorpion for 12 exciting chapters to keep him from getting the lens marvel is played by former cowboy star tom tyler in fine fashion david sharpe does the leaps and landings in realistic style flying scenes still look great today with excellent special effects by the lydecker brothers the scorpion is voiced by another actor and should keep the viewer guessing until the final reel music by cy feurer william lava and others add more excitement to fine serial whitney and english directed ', ' female superhero very weird one at that from the first episode with even the mundane feeling good to say the least it is not meant to be sexy when the character jessica jones undresses to go to sleep no nudity in case you were wondering and it not and yet it may be the moment you fall in love with her netflix in coorperation reckon with marvel made the best of their own universe taking characters and making shows with them shows that were different in nature with their own strengths and their own weaknesses and as much as love jessica jones as cool as think even if predictable season 3 is it did have certain things that almost drove me mad why you ask that was what was asking at character decisions and plot points but it is as it is if am still allowed to use that term jessica jones is strong but she is also broken down she is not unlike the punisher in some regards though less filled with anger she kind of cares but she kind of doesn give or any for that matter what is great is how her sidekicks are portrayed and every single other character that is in this there is callback and cameo of one of season 1 characters late in season 3 and overall this has sort of satisfying end still it is weird that almost every character seems to be up for disney plus reboot or continuation except her or maybe she is and everything is secret right now whatever the case this is all done and just tip to anyone rating and reviewing please wait until either all seasons are done before doing so or review only for any given episode instead of whole show based on one season alone ', ' this show is cringe they tried to be culturally perfect with religious phrases others but turned it into boring show even it boring for kids and she doesn suit as ms marvel by miles ', ' it really doesn live up to the non stop usual marvel action that it portrayed in commercials trailers and that hoped for the idea is great but it very cheesy and the fight scenes reminded me of something from relic hunter or something just as corny it has very campy feel to it can see this doing better in the afternoon for youngsters with the adults sitting down behind them reading book or maybe even back and forth cooking supper tuning in here and there the characters are also so dull bland and not very likable or relate able if the next few episodes don pick up or something ground breaking happens can see lot of viewers dropping off as the season progresses ', ' humbly request marvel please don make this type of disaster we are already wounded by caption marvel now this ms marvel mean who is going to watch in india indian audience want iron man back ', ' episode 1 is out only as write this lot of the visual stuff was excellent including the use of surrounding signs to show the contents of text conversations which was visually more interesting than just showing the texts and many more small details the edits and transitions were well done all the characters were well rounded and distinct you can identify with all of them except for the main character who is just 2 dimensional garbage every character was distinct and watchable and with any other protagonist this show might have gone well unfortunately the protagonist was written to be an annoying self obsessed garbage person so the protagonist and whole point and focal point of the show was weakly written irritating pushover and whiny not the most compelling character also m not sure how captain marvel can be the favourite avenger of anyone in the mcu not just the main character either but there was whole captain marvel cosplay competition with number of competitors there was also no indication there was contest for cosplaying any other mcu character no indication the captain marvel was only one of the cosplay competitions like for any of the avengers people within the mcu would have heard of carol danvers was only on earth for 5 minutes in the 90 before khan was born and which probably wasn made public and as recall from that terrible movie did nothing in the modern era because she was written to be so strong in her own movie that she couldn do anything ever again as whichever movie the smirking jerk appears in would end in 5 minutes so the premise is flawed the main character is unwatchable and she is the whole point of the show as establishing her the family dynamic and then origin storying her powers at least the family is good and watchable it just shame that family couldn have had better written daughter as it might have been worth watching if she been better written and less of whiny walter mitty type ', ' her 2005 and 2006 movies esp the island and match point were her best ones afterwards didn particularly like anything of her that remember her casting as ginger instead of real one like karen gillan was bland as bland as any of the changes of hair skin color or gender of other known characters in recent cinema an tv casting her also as lucy and ghost in the shell this time dyed black hair monopolising any female action hero really became annoying concerning now the character of black widow she is not very interesting don understand what is her point in the avengers team besides showing scarlett derriere which has been already seen during the fappening times and is probably not better than any of my neighborhood women bw has no special skills to justify her participation the movie started rather well but despite some good ideas for the plot and some marvelised action scenes the rest was rather boring to me who had to watch the movie in pieces to finish it ', ' this eagerly awaited epic blockbuster didn disappoint in the slightest the big budget 220m movie directed by the relatively inexperienced director joss whedon buffy the vampire slayer and serenity incorporates the personal motives of every character in fighting war that can only be won by the super powers that be the film oozes coolness and the futuristic technology with leave the viewer smiling and connecting with each character the plot of the movie revolves very much around fantasy with aspects of sci fi which works well to ensure the hero really are up against challenge there were areas which could have been better explained with regard to the villainous characters and where the portal came from however with running time of 144 minutes you can certainly understand why it wasn the movie is rated 12a as it should be with no real violent scenes or swearing and lot more humorous that initially expected film made for an extremely diverse audience families groups of friends marvel readers and even couples good acting good effects good soundtrack great film ', ' entitled characters banal script no one wants to see some bratty child getting powers out of nowhere and doing idiotic things with it mon marvel the whole diversity thing is just not working here ', ' only thing can say is wish it were longer and we had one more fight scene with black widow and taskmaster the opening scene and artist credits with great song choice starts the movie up perfectly black widow sister instantly becomes fan favorite and wish they would bring black widow back because she deserves trilogy action scenes were on next level and the drama and sad truth of the movie is it backbone how did you keep your heart for the most part this movie stayed on task ', ' movie is boring as fkk lacks action too hard plot of the movie why because family ', ' really loved the start it looks like it going to fun and novel addition to the mcu expanding the universe think this one really tell the story well from teens perspective even more so than the spider man trilogy did the writing and direction top notch they kept the pacing on point and didn waste time with irrelevancies all the actors played their parts to perfection nothing over done or over acted looking forward to the rest of the series and the upcoming marvels film regarding some of the negative reviews would say they are meaningless and come from those who fear diversity and inclusiveness and m certain are not fans of the character or marvel at all the one thing appreciate is perspective am not teen girl visible minority so the only way can get sense and understanding of those parts of our world is through others watch and listen and try to empathize doing that makes me better and the world better ', ' mostly love marvel movies but lately the quality of the story telling dropped dramatically and this series is one of the worse to me it feels like icarly or some other disney channel children show guess this mini series is created to have more inclusion and diversity and to give an entry point to the marvel universe to young kids ', ' put big hollywood movies into two categories deep state propaganda film with an agenda of social engineering fear mongering creating division or rewriting history alliance military sponsored film promoting constructive lessons on our reality and encouraging humanity to get off its knees and embrace positive future captain marvel was clearly type movie for me the movie hit all the right nights for great story telling experience likeable characters good chemistry believable motivations nostalgia for the 90 exciting action and an uplifting sense of purpose my only complaint was that the movie wasn longer more fleshed out flashback scenes would add more depth want to see m doing karaoke at the bar and getting hit on by some cocky pilots the biggest takeaways for me after walked out the theater 1 loved the message that humans never give up 2 black white friendly aliens who cares if we look funny there going to be big culture differences but we can all be friends 3 disclosure is coming if you are paying attention you know that there has been big coverup of alien life secret space programs true earth history this film is preparing the public for life in cosmic community 4 there are good and bad et some are just opportunistic we do need strong military presence in space to maintain fair and safe relations with the technological advanced et community ', ' the movie feels very boring and is lazyly written action scenes felt over the top and extremely unrealistic given that natasha romanov is just normal human being yet in the movie she could have been female captain america and what up with making her father comic relief that just didn fit with the movie at all natasha as character is so iconic and the movie had so much potential but that all is wasted in predictable storyline boring antagonist forced and unlikable humor bad cgi and choppy pacing was hoping for true origin story that actually centered around her youth and budapest in the soviet times not the copy paste modern times semi scifi garbage it was give it 2 stars but only because of scarlet johanson her acting is good it a shame that the material they gave her to work with was just plain bad ', ' had semi high hopes for this movie but unfortunatelly it was all for naught the movie is from the very beginning walking talking 90s action movie clich with your generic russian bad guys fake russian accents fake russian names the works add to it forced bad ass girl hero that at 45kg super model body can defeat 100kg super soldiers and very predictable plot total cringe fest was only able to watch until the predictable and useless but classic reunion making up fight between the main characters this is the one mcu movie will gladly skip ', ' disgrace storyline cheap filming movie is rushed too many clich bad acting and many more ', ' really enjoyed this film find most marvel films grossly over the top in terms of effects noise and grandeur to the point that sometimes you can barely see or hear what going on they re typically painfully long for rather straight forward storyline refreshingly this was shorter cleaner and fun this film strikes me as the sort of movie that you might find it trendy to dislike because it departs from the norm set by the series and while absolutely can see that there are elements that displease the aficionados if you can step back from that and see it instead as starter in new series of films rather than compare it to the others it a just damn good modern family film ', ' had high hopes for this show after the absolutely incredible first episode the art style animation incredible color and camera work and the sheer inventiveness of the combination hand drawn scenery and real world antics come together in gorgeous and exciting way after that episode ended my immediate thought was wow how are they going to top that the answer is they don like not even close the rest of the episodes in the series feel like they were put together by completely different team with totally different vision for the show gone is all of the interesting imagination meets reality style gone is all of the vibrancy and hyper kinetic pacing gone is what d call the soul of the show instead it becomes pretty generic origin story with an interesting look at pakistani culture which almost makes up for the lackluster pacing had never even heard of the partition for instance which is pretty big freaking deal and it was fascinating to learn more about that culture but it all at odds with the pacing of the story and as result the show kind of drags to halt by episode 3 not to mention it pretty clear they blew the production budget on episode 1 because the effects just look bad her powers specifically look like something from the late 90 somebody would whip up on video toaster the 3d rendering tool of the time think all polygons and shinyness ugghhh also the villian motivation makes very little sense d go into why but don want to hit the spoilers button anyway very disappointing after strong start ', ' bruh there is no islam or the right islam in this show it is american islamic agenda not the islam has our prophet used to be examples the mother says bismllah before she driving and when she started to drive she has accident it is clear agenda and the father was shocked when he saw camira and says are we in the future it is clear american wrong version about muslims that they don understand the technology and there is looottt of american islamic version don even think to make movie about us again and don even understand muslims life or our religion ', ' still sad it was cut short but all three seasons are amazing and really rewatchable ', ' the marvels is cinematic experience that left me torn between moments of awe and frustration directed by the talented nia dacosta the film brings together an ensemble cast of characters from the marvel cinematic universe mcu in an ambitious attempt to weave multiple storylines into one cohesive narrative while the film certainly has its shining moments it ultimately falls short of delivering truly satisfying superhero spectacle one of the film strengths lies in its visual appeal the special effects and action sequences are nothing short of spectacular showcasing the technological prowess of the film industry the intricate details of the superhero suits along with the breathtaking cgi landscapes contribute to the immersive nature of the movie the cinematography and direction elevate certain scenes to level of visual poetry providing viewers with feast for the eyes however where the marvels stumbles is in its narrative execution the attempt to juggle multiple storylines simultaneously becomes overwhelming leading to disjointed and confusing plot the film struggles to find balance between character development and advancing the overarching narrative leaving some characters feeling underutilized and underdeveloped additionally the pacing of the film is inconsistent making it challenging to stay engaged throughout its runtime moments of intense action are abruptly interrupted by lengthy exposition disrupting the flow of the story and causing the viewer to lose connection with the characters the performances of the cast are mixed bag while some actors deliver powerful and emotionally resonant portrayals others seem to struggle with the uneven script the chemistry between certain characters is palpable providing moments of genuine connection but these instances are overshadowed by the overall lack of cohesion in the storytelling the marvels attempts to introduce new elements to the mcu but the execution leaves much to be desired some plot twists feel forced and the inclusion of certain characters appears more like marketing strategy than natural progression of the narrative in conclusion the marvels is visually stunning yet narratively flawed addition to the mcu while it has its moments of brilliance the film falls short of meeting the high expectations set by its predecessors it a rollercoaster of emotions that unfortunately spends too much time navigating loops and turns leaving the audience with sense of disorientation and dissatisfaction 4 10 rating reflects the film missed potential and its struggle to find harmonious balance between spectacle and substance ', ' don know what was expecting but this isn it this series seems pointless and doesn add any value feel like wasted my time on the first episode m shocked disney spent time and resources creating this and it the first new series we get on disney from marvel disappointed ', ' basically this is just chase film very little story tedious action stunts paper thin acting it a throwaway film which is why marvel probably didn want to make it in the first place if you re fanboy you ll probably get through pack or two of tissues but for anyone with an ounce of intelligence give this miss ', ' this is not great movie it not even very good one liked the first avengers movie this one greatly disappointed me the plot and subplot barely there all the snappy dialog in the whole movie maybe equaled two minutes character relationships we re supposed to believe them the audience wasn born yesterday this movie focuses on the fight scenes technically they impressed me counted 11 visual effects companies in the credits didn time the fight scenes but would guess that they take up at least 90 minutes of the movie so if you like fight scenes this movie is for you for the rest of us meh ', ' whats happening here used to at least be able to end marvel movie this one just walked out m done as huge nick fury fan nick fury is supposed to be the best spy the one who protects everything with some questionable tactics and sacrifices the mcu nick fury is useless old man weak coward who is used for comic relief instead we get 3 incompetent heroes with zero personal character growth and yet another forgettable villain no one cares about guess the effects are good enough the actors do the most with what little they get it just useless story with useless heroes useless villains in useless universe setting up new useless stories ', ' way more fun than the recent overblown mcu tripe multiverse quantumania guardians3 yes it helps to have seen the ms marvel series to get the full context on kamala khan and her family what saw was fast paced funny and somewhat emotional movie each character gets chance to shine and the various worlds and setups had me laughing out loud personally ve disliked the incessant push towards the next big bad kang multiverse the early mcu thrived on character development building story for each hero so that when the avengers finally assembled it meant something with the marvels mcu has fast paced funny action packed character driven gem kamala and her family are hysterical monica rambeau is trying to find her place and carol danvers works through some hidden emotional baggage to tie them all together no this is not manly testosterone laden big boom movie nor is it high artful cinema too much of the recent mcu takes itself too seriously instead the marvels is fun romp with meaningful characters and some fantastic absurdity ', ' one of the most overrated of marvel movies in history ', ' yet another action movie that can decide if it supposed to be tear jerking heart warming movie about family or an action packed superhero extravaganza this needed different director one who could tell the difference between an action movie and lets get in touch with our feelings movie and not try to combine the two into watered down version of either ', ' im huge marvel fan and hate to critizise but it is bad got lot of charlies angels vibe out of this movie which could be the worst feeling in the world the movie is so unrealistic and exaggerated in bad way it might be difficult to do movie based on superhero with out any actually super powers ', ' spolier alert don read further if you feel you don wanna get your hopes too high trust me guys the movie is so freaking awesome any superhero movie fan would be in for treat but the least you expect from it the more you would enjoy and savor each and every 150 minute of this flick my hands have been itching to write this review from the moment the end credits rolled on the screen to start off take bow and applaud mr joss whedon the director and writer of this movie he has done what countless movie makers couldn achieve when they attempted to make super hero movie with the same set of characters and actors his ensemble of superheroes has more character depth more action more story and some effervescently witty dialogues than any of the other solo movies based on the characters of this film whedon has come up with script that cheeky and breezy full of witty banter and sly pop culture shout outs as well as self referential humor one that moves with an infectious energy that almost makes you lose track of its two and half hour running time the hype has been building for years and it couldn possibly be more deafening at this point four years ago around the same time iron man arrived in theaters and kicked off bold long term plan by hollywood standards at least that would see four different marvel superheroes appear in their own solo movies then unite in single film featuring not just all of the previous films stars but many of their supporting cast too what unbelievable though is that despite all of the odds against it and the stratospheric expectations heaped upon it the avengers still manages to not only live up to those expectations but to exceed them with an epic adventure that just as impressive as its larger than life characters for film that required so many prologues to get to this point it surprising how little up front exposition is required to bring newcomers up to speed with the avengers universe while the film clearly assumes some familiarity with the main characters and few basic plot points of the preceding films iron man the incredible hulk thor iron man 2 and captain america the first avenger co writers joss whedon and zak penn have done great job of weaving any necessary information into the early portions of the film and making the exposition feel organic the premise of the avengers is this thor evil brother loki tom hiddleston has returned and he plans to use the tesseract the powerful glowing blue cube last seen in captain america to take over earth when loki proves too powerful for nick fury samuel jackson and h e d to take down on their own all of the characters from the previous marvel studios films team up to defeat loki and the alien horde helping him to be honest on the face of it the plot does seem to be taken straight out of comic book and is laughably old school in its simplicity but its genius lies in how this bare bones narrative foundation allows the film talented cast and creative team the room to do what they do best it the sort of adventure that comic fans are accustomed to seeing in print but just like the best comics the avengers truly shines in how it fills out its narrative skeleton and the area around these tropes with vibrant storytelling compelling character development and moments filled with so much heart and humor that the entire package stands on its own joss whedon has pulled off the tricky feat of juggling large ensemble cast and giving everyone chance to shine of balancing splashy set pieces with substantive ideology stuff gets blown up real good in beautifully detailed 3 in the avengers the area in and around grand central terminal for example gets obliterated beyond recognition in an exhausting climactic battle but the film as whole is never mess from narrative perspective read more at http devlifeintechnicolor com 2012 05 01 the avengers the best superhero movieneed say more ', ' in my opinion it is the finest serial ever mode highlighting the serial were the fabulous flying sequences combining wired dummy photographed against real backgrounds in natural sunlight with spectacular take off leaps and landings the final effects are still fascinating today as they were in 1941 ', ' am really disappointed by imdb it cannot be that movie is rated with 9 before it actually goes to the screen did not want to watch this movie when saw the trailer unfortunately read reviews and got misled by this high rating on imdb expected much but got an average action movie the movie was not entertaining by profoundness it was an 2 1 2 hour orgy of visual fireworks this may be awesome for under aged persons but this definitely is not satisfying an audience that wants story good character description and most important movie which is not completely foreseeable imdb should consider that their rating system lacks crucial information about the age of the reviewers give 6 of 10 because the visual effects were great but thats not what defines good movie ', ' the inconsistency is maddening in some scenes she takes out several well trained men in other scenes she loses fight to female with stick it absolutely bs the writers are either 6 years old or on crack some episodes are cleverly written and seem well though out and then the plot will fall off the table like creamsicle melting on an august sidewalk think the writer gets fatigued and let his 4th grade daughter finish up most episodes ', ' black widow should have been compact pithy film filled with her being badass and bit of interesting back story instead we got rather ridiculous ode to bw sj which didn really answer any questions about her past but made up bunch of new stuff ', ' the movie was absolute trash horrible scripts least menacing villain ever no chemistry between the actors and mundane story line the movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near 8 5 rating its alright as kids movie it does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2 the movie is often commended for its humor in my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile nothing special at all despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie so if you want watch at least decent super hero flick you might as well pick up watchmen men first class spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy ', ' putting aside anything about the actress or culture this has to be the most boring thing marvel related since they started their production of all these movies and shows over decade ago this show is clearly meant for younger audience but how will they enjoy watching this when there is 0 action or anything interesting going on with long episodes kids do best with short episodes someone needs to step in and replace either the writing or director or something to fix this fast because don see how they finish the series much less make second season ', ' the origin of natasha romanoff is explored in an action packed reunion with her lost family think black widow is an okay entry to the marvel cinematic universe that has some decent cinematic moments good character work but also some key elements that let it down liked the basic plot and character arcs which are set up well by brilliant opening sequence highly reminiscent of the americans after that think it gets bit stop start and hit miss also some scenes feel bit too close to movies like bourne and kill bill at times like the dynamic between natasha and yelena scarlett johansson and florence pugh have excellent chemistry and both give strong performances it takes lot to rival johansson presence but pugh certainly shares the stage with strong charisma there are some great feminist themes plus other allegories about the oppression of freedom with the two lead characters plus others written well to translate them on screen david harbour and rachel weisz are both solid particularly harbour who adds some decent humour to number of scenes not all of the jokes land but he works as bit of comic relief in the midst of the more serious family dramatics this is matter of personal taste but ray winstone does not work as russian villain for me guess there somewhat of bond tribute going on but the mumbled cockney russian dialogue felt endless at times bizarre casting decision another problem and for me the biggest one is the length and volume of action spectacle characters fall off multi story buildings have fights to look cool suffer horrific car crashes move in clich slow motion in front of massive explosions jump off more things and fall and fall and fall and there barely scratch on anyone there is lot of extended ridiculous moments of cartoonish action that disrupt the flow of the story outside of the excessive cgi spectacle the imagery is mostly good the cinematography editing colour grading and visual storytelling is all high quality overall am disappointed as think the black widow character deserves better solo outing but it is saved from disaster by the two leading ladies ', ' when 2012 4 28 20 00 where dream mall kaohsiung taiwan how driving to theater why my cellphone company taiwan mobile invite me member of vip with two free tickets to see this movie whom went with my friend pingzong originally m not that kind of big fan for the comic books and want to yield to another friend however he busy that day so just went with the other one what despite of some irrationality of the movie what it inspires me is the idea of making an elaborate story with diversely sub stories and some hints in them and converge later into cohesive one the idea should be huge with key features across the sub stories so that major one can subsequently consolidate them some idea of scene doesn fall into the traditional and surprise and impress you then conclusion good one for recreation ', ' why don they hire real russian actors or actresses they did the same thing with black panther with the bad korean its joke and just seems discriminating to my eyes when they over stereotype culture or country ', ' had decent expectations going in to this film couple of months ago but wow it really is disaster firstly this film really should have been phase 2 mcu and secondly it so boring the she ruins yet another iconic character like they did mysterio this time instead of fish bowl head they change the gender of great character and make it boring 1 dimensional character who says nothing this film is straight up joke and is perfect representation of how bad marvel is these days the film may of been 5 but it awful rip off clone wars finale makes it low 3 for me ', ' so over rated such predictable storyline if knew it would not have watched it d better wash dishes rather than watch this crap if you really really don have anything else what to watch than yeah otherwise it just time waste story is pathetic superwoman who likes to sacrifice herself in some really joking situations just to defeat some other looser to be honest don know if the story is bad or the actors or maybe both but to get to conclusion 8 8 it way too much for such mediocre tv series ve watching better tv series which by some reason got canceled hopefully the same will happen for this also ', ' incredible stunts effects but silly storyline with plot points sequences that lack believability even for comic book movie ', ' fine piece of work from actors and actresses directing writing etc what separates it from just being blood and guts series is that it takes close look into ptsd our veterans and outright corruption of our government policy and lawmakers in regards to operation decisions on and off american soil fictitious account nonetheless with merits in the dark reality that we live and hide ourselves from do not disagree with putting those kinds of people down without trial and jury sometimes we cannot get the tangible evidence required to drag them through the justice system when influence titles resources equate to power and judicial invulnerability men like frank castle should take stand and just do what needs to be done remove it from this world entirely the way they capture the character dynamics that make frank castle is outstanding when you speak of dynamic characters the punisher in this adaptation is one the most the supporting cast which are usually static was opened up well too each scm performed and was written in very well creating dynamic views and allowing you to really root for the good guys you get connection from every performance applaud all those involved in this outstanding series ', ' the comedy is good think kamala khan brings fresh air to the movie her character and her family was so fun to watch their reaction the fight scenes and just their whole presence was so wonderful wished they had played more on that instead of some forced moments the plot is bad basically its so meh and dumb some things happened just for the sake of continuing the plot not for the logic and the framing of some scenes are so bad it made the movie so cheap looking actually it reminded me of how bad justice league was it had those cringing and awkward moment it is shame because in the first 10 20m of the movie it was actually fun the first fight scene where they kept swapping was so good and creative it brought me hope for this movie combined with kamala khan family but then after that everything was such slog shame shame shame ', ' this is truly an incredible movie the actors were all on point and did great job did miss edward norton in the film but mark ruffalo definitely won me over and was very pleased with his work in this film recommend this movie to anyone looking for action packed film full of drama and chaos robert downey jr is probably my favorite actor and if not he very high on my list but the commitment and work put in from the entire crew of production and filming members is one for the books m really looking toward to seeing second part to this movie and m very confident when say that know it will be great if you know anything about any of these comic book heroes then m sure you didn need to see any movies such as the iron man trilogy thor captain america or the hulk to understand this film but having seen all of those leading up to the avengers is what made this movie incredible the investment and work put in by everyone just amazes me keep up the good work marvel ', ' this movie was fun to watch scojo has long deserved her own movie but unfortunate release timing it just did not feel like it was the right movie to kick off the new saga the villain side of the film was underwhelming need more from taskmaster this movie is good stand alone film but fell victim to the mcu expectations some of the disney plus shows had more impact on the upcoming saga and that is what think disappoints many ', ' this movie is good m sure that young girls will love it would let my daughter watch it if had any it is worthwhile female driven but captain marvel is powerful smart strong character she deserved much better sequel to her origin story film captain marvel it great to have photon ms marvel they are outstanding characters too but captain marvel is warrior she deserved better captain america or iron man would have had better script better cgi why did captain marvel get cheated hope someone writes better tighter script that makes the most of this character and for photon ms marvel as well ', ' the storyline is little bit boring but the last 30 mins is great if was solely judging the last 30 mins alone would have given it 8 or 9 10 ', ' probably the most solidly structured movie ve ever seen what admire about the avengers is that it doesn go in guns blazing from the start it doesn open with the avengers themselves but with nick fury and maria hill who are there right at the beginning of what is eventually one of the best superhero movies ever charged with explosive action mind blowing spectacle and big laughs when the world is threatened by loki and his army of alien chitauri the avengers initiative is activated and team of the most remarkable beings come together to save the world from obliteration iron man thor captain america hulk black widow and hawkeye team up in one of the best movie finales to hit our screens new york is playground for jaw dropping action stunning camera shots and immersive 3d joss whedon ability to balance out this enormous cast is unlike any other and with whip smart writing and powerhouse story this is the ultimate marvel adventure would watch this again dozen times and more this is perfect choice for movie night family night in and the cast are better than ever playing these superheroes we ve come to love over the past few years and watching hawkeye dive off an exploding rooftop backwards firing his arrow brings me the nerdiest of nerd tears ', ' tuned out on episode one countless times but once dived there was no going back needs part 2 and then full fledged movie no more no less marvel make it happen pls asap fits right in and could surpass deadpool imo so much left to unlock loved it ', ' know very little about the comics but the show is certainly the of the 4 marvel shows featured on netflix the show has feeling of being complete even the opening credits are amazing the show blows away the mcu even deadpool they make full use of every minute available in every episode love this show love the crossovers hope we get to enjoy dd and hope they give us long quality run along with the rest of the defenders ', ' trish walker character is so sick season 3 sucks even more ', ' liked the setting in the first chapter and that was it some stiff necked people might say that this film is too childish however it was not for me the episode took me to my imaginary illusion and they depicted everything that was on my mind in considerable detail namely young lady who was frequently fantasising and so lackadaisical about her future for she was still beguiled in her fanciful fancy that was general description of me moreover read on the news that one film actor had no prior experience which created distinctive unexplainable nuance for she was permitted to appear in front of the camera for the first time another tirade throughout the show there were hilarious graphics and distinctive doodles that seek to express the characters moods namely sorrowful content frightened confident and trepidatious moods smeared in such format making it as detailed as in the short teaser for the film thus this was work that was not overly heavy to be carried on with no excessive violence or coarse language for whoever person who uses crude language is eternally considered vile in conduct and soul ', ' couldn stand yet another character being stolen changed but then you change the stupid characters back story to something even more stupid ridiculous with it not being natural power like supposed to be atleast falcon became captain in one of the story lines of the comics which makes it iffy only because he not super soldier in the show which then makes it stupid ', ' ve must say that expected more but this is actually good first scene of the movie where is discussed her childhood is such amazing story after that its just secondary movie we waiting for 2 years and why s rlly dont want to flop rating bc im fan of marvel and that is only one reason why rate it 10 of 10 ', ' calling all true believers assemble for the marvels celestial adventure promising to unite captain marvel monica rambeau and ms marvel does it soar to the heights of previous mcu epics or leave you grounded with disappointment buckle up true believers and let chart course through this intergalactic odyssey while the narrative juggles three powerful heroines their journeys feel less like harmonious ensemble and more like individuals struggling to align the plot ambitious yet overused throws timelines villains and character development into cosmic blender resulting in somewhat muddled concoction while not visually catastrophic the film special effects occasionally suffer from budgetary nebulae leaving some action sequences feeling more like movie meteors than dazzling supernovae additionally the narrative pacing can be uneven with stretches of exposition dragging down the momentum like rogue asteroids still moments of humor and genuine heroics manage to break through the cosmic dust reminding us why we love these characters and the mcu in the first place so should you embark on this interstellar voyage if you re die hard mcu fan desperate for your next superhero fix the marvels might offer moderately entertaining diversion think of it as fun space romp with some familiar faces but manage your expectations accordingly don anticipate groundbreaking narrative or groundbreaking visuals but if you re yearning for an emotional gut punch or cinematic masterpiece you might be left wishing you were rewatching infinity saga instead ', ' think quarantine has made everyone little more angry and bitter because honestly this is one of my new favorite marvel movies hardly ever pay to go see movie in theater twice but m going to go see this again dont watch it on disney plus your tv does not do the movie justice the action is made for the big screen so go see it ', ' can appreciate the diversity and the need to add multicultural ideas but its so poorly done there are many average marvel shows but at least they are watchable this one is so skip able ', ' there were some nice twists but overall the film was too long tried to cover way too much ground and ended up being classic case of more is less scarlet and florence were enjoyable david and rachel were serviceable but the movie bogged down the longer it went on this is definitely not film d care to watch again ', ' initially thought it to be movie with suspensefull entries of captain america but later found they weren it would have been nice if other avengers had also been included moreover it was nice film ', ' season 2 took nosedive extremely boring first episode and then just gets worst and worst ', ' the animation is poor there are fan animations better than this and the fight scenes are dull with gore being used to mask the lackluster artwork and designs all the characters are unlikable and the story is just generic revenge plot sudeikis just wont shut up there is no reason for me to recommend this to anyone you can tell the studio didnt believe in this product by the production quality alone so why should waste my time on it as well go watch invicible castlevania or try anime ', ' just came home from my local cinema black widow was the perfect film to go back to the cinema after more than year natasha was portrayed dignified brave and strong recommend all to watch it humorous nice acting good script and healthy pace there are some awesome camera shots in different countries it was so nice to be in cinema again after year and black widow is the perfect movie to start again the character development of natasha started from iron man 2 to having her own movie they did great job to finish her story on screen the fight scenes were bit off for my taste but do prefer easter fight scenes and stunts more but still entertaining and far from embarrassing really can believe those negative critics the movie was pushed for over year due to pandemic and finally its there support your local cinemas to enjoy movies like black widow and have nice time ', ' this show was really boring they tried to salvage it by bringing big stars in some episodes if you are looking for something to make you fall asleep fast this is the answer ', ' this is childish without it being for all audiences similar to other pg movies where there a mix of humor to engage everyone it is like watching hanna montana for marvel not sure m looking forward to seeing more episodes ', ' don know where to start daredevil is complete success to me so far the first season was already very pleasant surprise and the second one is doing great maybe even better if that possible the recipe is complete you have great script great actors great production value the fight scenes are worthy of any multimillion dollar budget movie without being too fancy it just believable the actors clearly give their all and their all is just what we want you really hate the bad guys and you really love the good ones but there are the ones in the middle and you know what they make sense kudos to the writers and guess to the whole team lighting director casting crew producers caterers and cleaning ladies the whole deal this is real treat and puts tv shows like arrow to shame which is not that difficult would say but still true this is not just pretty boys and girls parade this is not just tv show showing off what they can do with some tricks of lighting choreography stunt men and women and whole lot of money they show you substance characters you can relate to or at the very least sympathize with there are real dialogs that people could actually have and the reactions are always appropriate whether you agree with them or not at first didn know where to begin and now m finding it hard to finish this ll just say that really recommend this tv show ', ' this type of content is exactly why disney and marvel can seem to get grip recently they flood us with bad writing and expect everyone to applause it a tired old formula that makes everyone involve look bad ', ' just finished the second season and have to say this it the best series ive ever seen just as much as daredevil jon bernthal acting is so breathtaking to be honest all the actors in season 2 were stunning have nothing but praise to give this show season 1 was bit rough but season 2 was masterpiece from the awesome relationship frank has with the girl and his 1 legged friend the cop even josh stewart the pilgrim please keep this show going as bad as billy russo was that dude also should get an award his acting was fantastic felt for him even though knew how bad he was sorry now m ranting just am trying to get my point across that this show is honestly masterpiece ', ' the movie had good story but choice of music scote was not good at all the dialogs were ok and they did not utilize the red room story ark or many characters story ark properly if they did all that movie could have been blockbuster this movie somehow felt should have released after black panther as well ', ' honestly the whole cgi fest that infinty war and endgame maybe great final send off to such long franchise but nothing will beat this masterpiece of movie every single character shines great use of practical effects combined with cgi touching moments and great pacing this movie really had it all ', ' mixture of james bond style incredible fight scenes and the darkest opening credits in mcu history the cast is incredible easily top five marvel movie for me possibly top three ', ' this movie was absolutely delightful couple plot holes that probably require comic book knowledge to fill out but prefer the gap in knowledge to having the movie get burdened with too much the characters were fun and the tone was refreshing if you like these characters you will love this movie if you don like these characters then why are you here just stay home this movie isn for you good balance of serious scenes and comedic ones the fighting choreography was wonderful thought it might be hard to follow but they did wicked good job balancing it ms marvel stole the show for sure ', ' so it seems like marvel has changed it path from making something for everyone to making kids show even my 12 years old cousin hated it think now we can call it end of an era ', ' after the long wait of almost year we finally get to see the best avenger get her own movie the movie was amazing had excellent fight scenes and we see natasha bond with her family it was rollercoaster of emotions love that they set up florence pugh yelena belova for an upcoming movies or tv shows in the mcu the movie was excellent and would recommend it to everyone ', ' it was pretty cool movie like brie larson performance she won the oscar for reason and think there was nothing feminist about it like what other ppl are saying it just movie about person who has powers and happened to be female just watch it and make your own opinion ', ' this is not very good it adds very little to the entire marvel universe and it is not very good stand alone like scarlett johnansson and the character but this is disappointing the supporting cast is good but the overly comedic tone and poor script left me thinking how much better this could have been the accents are horrible this is poorly directed the action and cinematography are ok but not enough to save this the special effects are grade at best david harbour made me laugh for sure but this backstory has too much comedic throughline to buy the deeper more intense moments robert downey drops funny lines but if he made himself clown the character would not work in my opinion ', ' found it little waste of time but because it was marvel stuck with it best part of it was the last episode end credit scene that alone says it all found it rushed and forced very much disney show rather than marvel if you have nothing to watch then go for it otherwise watch the others again ', ' no don think the avengers is entirely horrible in fact it a perfectly decent escapist type movie but don expect to walk away from the theatre with new found love for life or fresh perspective that any real movie will deliver the avengers is the current water cooler movie for good reason it easy to talk about the cgi the action the comedy it easy and might as well have laugh track it so instructive from start to finish the plot carries the same formula inyourfaceaction comic relief inyourfaceaction comic relief repeat until done the jokes were painfully predictive and obvious felt like cattle being herded along the movie all too aware of the cheap tricks used to get the audience laughing at budget of over 200 million it felt cheap and without substance also think it insulting this movie carries such high imdb rating suppose most don realize they re cattle ', ' like the series but the episodes that went to portugal people in portugal don talk that way it seems more like brazilian portuguese considering that it was in portugal and not in brazil was very careless ', ' ironman captain america the hulk thor eagle eye and the black widow unite under the shield banner to face colossal threat led by fallen god loki come at this both late the film is already one of the most financially successful films ever made as write these lines and relatively indifferent to the whole avengers mythos am also unfamiliar with said mythos superman and batman are well established in europe but many of marvel properties are much less so with that in mind the folks at marvel deserve an award for long term strategic planning under almost any shape an avengers film would have made deal of money so it is to the credit of the powers behind this behemoth that time was taken to establish each of the heroes individually before embarking on this group adventure the choice of iron man as starting point particularly with the genius casting of robert downey junior proved especially savvy iron man has many similarities to batman but where the latter now the heart of hugely successful rival film franchise is at heart quite dark and brooding iron man is inherently light hearted and fun something the first film outing captured brilliantly assembling the avengers was not always smooth process the shield line felt bit shoehorned into the hulk reboot derailed the plot or iron man sequel and frustratingly cut short captain america period solo potential and now that they were finally together supported by fresh film back stories of varying quality for the uninitiated you think the studio would sit back and enjoy an easy success thankfully you be wrong from the first few seconds up to the ending the film oozes with love for its characters giving most of them not only defining moments but also the fine small details that make you care downey junior could have easily walked away with the honors regardless of the overall film qualities that the filmmakers try their best to create sense of balance shows both respect and confidence in their other characters and strong determination to make this work as team vehicle the often square captain america is thankfully done justice and after two different attempts the hulk is finally spot on mark ruffalo giving the film most of its heart and pathos until the avengers the world was gearing up for the dark knight grand finale trilogy that took mildly ridiculous premise and turned it into dark gritty and grand opera and for all their admirable qualities nolan masterpiece and its two companion pieces sometimes felt tad grim the avengers strikes perfect balance between serious stakes and its inherent ridiculousness here joss whedon of whom was no fan coming into this proves himself ideally suited to the task his trademark wit is perfectly attuned to the material the biggest summer blockbuster of 2012 is finely crafted rousing adventure sparkled with humor and character love of its protagonists and above all fun thank you marvel and everyone involved for creating such high expectations and then exceeding them ', ' marvel one shot all hail the king the final marvel one shot all hail the king also has the notoriety of being the worst it is an epilogue of sorts to ben kingsley role as the drunk drug addled actor trevor slattery he is now in prison serving time as the mouthpiece of the mandarin the one shot is set up as documentary on the actor life but turns out to be nothing more than revenge plot concocted by the real mandarin unseen seeing justin hammer suddenly gay in prison with him was kind of amusing however much more of this should have been explored as was never fan of this fake mandarin crap that the movie put forth this short just wasn any good except it was nice to see another of marvel series of epilogues ', ' watched first episode it was so routine and boring but gave chance and watched 2 and 3 it was still boring there is nothing novel about the superhero character just follows old trend nothing new to watch it doesn suit for kids below 12 as well so there is no point of watching with family either ', ' poor stan lee is weeping as he watches this beautiful franchise he created be destroyed by this desperate attempt to make marvel woke between disney and the mcu we have seen some of the worst writing and cinematography of all time every episode is just pathetic attempt to pander to the public 0 10 if could ', ' is it just me or any new entry into the superheroes franchises getting less and less interesting and engaging story is weak action is generic acting is subpar me no likie much ', ' first off iman vellani is adorable she perfectly cast in the role hands down the script is good lighthearted fun coming of age super hero origin in similar vein to spiderman and is cultural celebration that gives me the same good feelings as black panther only two episodes have been released at this point and was hooked from the first ten minutes of the first episode there was no way that wasn going to like this show as with any marvel property it relies on some tried and true tropes but that not to its detriment if anything it adds to the charm find myself repeatedly cheering for kamala khan as she figures out her powers already had training montage and as she grows into her role as hero can wait to see how the rest of the show pans out she yet another hero we can all root for and m already looking forward to seeing her again in marvels next year ', ' worst series from entire mcu was waiting for episodes to improve but it just went from bad to worst marvel should stop making such series to maintain dignity going further worst screenwriting poor acting bad locations touch of music feels smoother this is not superhero series by even kids standard hope they does not continue this in mcu ', ' actually first season was fantastic really enjoyed it most character gave everything good in the first season each episode was great story but in the 2nd season find till episode 15 is so boring and very slow so sad for that think 2nd season should take another name instead of agent of shield may be romance of shield series lost the passion in 2nd season am so sad in the first season within fast series scenes you will notice the relations between actors and will enjoy it more action with enough drama you will find yourself may be watch same episode many times and enjoy but in different way 2nd season till now feel boring if you missed 3 episodes you will not miss anything too much drama and its not useful don hate drama but it is not good make the series become boring ', ' m not going to try to win everyone over by giving my review cheesy over done headline m not also going to try to persuade you by comparing this movie to christopher nolan batman movies am fan of both dc and marvel comics when people do so it drives me nuts so m not going to give review bashing the other like lot of fans on here so that being said the avengers is great movie all the movies that lead up to this film made this one fantastic start to what could be an even better new saga from the get go this movie starts out with what the rest of it will bring for one think sometimes 2 1 2 hours for movie is little drawn out and very few times have sat through movie that long and felt was short changed it is very entertaining very funny and full of action joss whedon truly lifted these characters from the pages of the comic into real life go see the movie saw it in 3 imax but to be honest any form of this movie is going to be just as great if you enjoyed the last actual marvel movies that lead us to this point you definitely wont be disappointed stay for at least the first after credit footage if you re an avenger comic fan like am you will grin from ear to ear ', ' marvels 2023 takes audiences on thrilling ride through the marvel cinematic universe delivering an

stellar cast engaging storyline and impressive visuals come together to create cinematic journey that is not to be missed whether you re die hard marvel fan or casual movie enthusiast marvels 2023 is must watch that will leave you eagerly anticipating the next chapter in the ever expanding marvel universe ', ' it was too jumbled and distracting visuals compared to other productions don see how this will be incorporated with capt marvel sequel which is more in line with other marvel productions if was younger might have enjoyed it but graffiti on walls etc gives young people ideas of tagging acceptance as far as m concerned in my opinion of course you are more than welcome to yours ', ' was hooked from the minute it started excellent writing with fascinating story populated with good characters with intelligence this is what ask for in movie ', ' one of the best web series ever watched daredevil is my favourite series highly recommending to watch this series daredevil is my favourite marvel characters this is very motivational series ', ' ridiculous series that calls for moral decay and perversion ', ' this episode would have been 10 10 except for just one scene there was sitting with my 11 year old nephew watching our favorite show last tuesday night when bam sky had to by put in scene where she just got out of bed with guy she thought she believed in and liked she was viewed in her little panties and bra as the legal guardian of my 11 year old who is seeking right from wrong in life the writers and producers of this episode ruined the night for us it was embarrassing mindless our home believes in postponing sexual involvement until marriage scene with an innocent hug and kiss would have been sufficient for this 8 00 m series keep it clean ', ' first of all m very disappointed in this show they completely changed her powers and don even get me started with the acting felt like was watching the sweet life of zac and cody level acting from disney channel was this show made for little kids because the plot and acting and everything about it was just so bad ', ' came into the fanboyhood of joss whedon late in my life realizing was fan of his productions unknowingly didn put him and avengers together until recently but after that was rather in anticipation of it since very much filmed with the same eye for sci fi as firefly the continuity of the film had warmth and familiarity to it that was easy to accept first off it is fantastic start to the summer blockbuster movies with films like prometheus and batteship also on the horizon will be probably more critical of what is to come as opposed to what just set the bar with legion of special effects people and filmed for 3d believe did an injustice seeing it in theater that was doing 2d some of the shots just did not come out the way think it would have if viewed behind the glasses saw it in 2d because am not huge fan of 3d and all the hype technically it was directed and filmed for 3d and doing backward compatibility might not have been the best however do believe that when released as bluray disk most people would not be able to watch it the production crew may need to tweak it bit before then secondly master hand was at the helm shifting the weight of the film skillfully between cgi action drama and comic relief every artist has the right to interpret story the way they see it based on characters the movie going public have already been introduced to m sure helped but for many only iron man has had the most press hulk seems to have failed captain america did well at the box office but was oddly out of place thor wasn as well received and his future as well wasn a forgone conclusion natasha hawkeye nick fury if you didn really read the comics you just wouldn have guessed at their place in movie with so many super ego in it somehow joss managed to extrapolate these vague characters and put them into solid mix that did not always get along to at the gitgo the story is strong with continuity and weaves strong relationship between the superhero without haste with strong beginning the plot is revealed very early but then dwells not so much on the story but the intermixing of the characters to form what the comic book is about the alliance of superheros as team called the avengers ever been in band where all the musicians compete for the spotlight but end up just increasing the gain of their amps it is not an easy lesson to learn but it was obvious that iron man was the primary focus meetings indifference competition and cooperation very hard lessons to learn when the world as we know it is at stake but they manage to put aside their egos for the common good and the saving of manhattan damn why is it new york city is always the focus of monstrous plots guess better not go there navigating the story there were many points where homage was paid to movies that preceded it obvious was independence day ghostbusters avatar and the likes you had mix of asian northern euro and american curltures which made for multifaceted presentation had few problems with future world design like the water air ship which staged the initial disharmony of the superheros will also reiterate my comment about 2d and 3d screen presentation alan sylvestri does stunning soundtrack which didn have the usual signature of the initial measure pop as in preceding films it was appropriate though solid theme was lacking or maybe just could not get theme figured out while viewing all the action one of my biggest surprises was the re write of bruce banner hulk totally unconventional the taught character of the gamma altered human was harsh intellectual and sometimes more unemotional than his counterpart hulk who really stood out as serious contender for relaunch or maybe new franchise if jeremy renner is open to it the super hero team accepted him and knew how to kindle the huge green giant passion and formed an amazing bond with his peers would love to see new hulk movie with this reworked character joss has weaved together an amazing story with very few holes and maybe will see it again but this time in 3d just to see if my observation of the 2d version is correct go see it great action great compassion great story thanks joss ', ' really enjoyed this movie it was so refreshing to watch strong female character feel carole was let down by the storyline only finding her true potential towards the end hope they do second one so we can see her use her full power more ', ' remember seeing the ad in comic and saying to myself wow that art is insultingly bad thinking it was something for youtube to later learn it was coming to disney thought maybe its too young for me so decided to watch it with my 8 year old brother after we watched it bland plot it cringy characters and listening to it weak stance on bullying we both did not enjoy watching heroes rise this was honestly the worst super hero mash up ve ever seen who thought any of these characters were good idea ', ' forced myself to watch it cause thought it would became interesting then after watching 3 episodes lose my hope didn wanted to watch episode 4 but then saw promo so gave try to episode 4 and ep4 was only the episode liked in this series then thought now this series would became interesting then after watching episode 5 and 6 it became more boring even the final episode fight was boring and predictable too if you like drama series then you can give it try but if you like action then this is not for you and keep your expectations low before watching this series not worth it at all ', ' as huge fan of marvel m little biased because pretty much like everything they put out my bias aside jessica jones is terrific if you don believe me just read through the reviews here and look at the ratings even the critics loved this krysten ritter was born to play jessica jones she is easily the best part of the show this is show that you ll want to binge as quickly as you can it that good it too bad that netflix couldn renew their contracts with marvel and they had to stop making the netflix marvel shows because every single one of them was great now that they re on disney they can bring these wonderful characters back they already started to with daredevil and kingpin and just renewed daredevil for another season now they have to do the same for the punisher luke cage and jessica jones at least bring them back into the mcu somehow if you re marvel fan then this is must watch ', ' actually even if you are not marvel fan you ll love it there is no boring seen in my opinion watched this 1 2 years ago and honestly was not marvel fan but when watched it absolutely loved it and now m waiting for season 2 to come out am writing review now because want everyone to watch this masterpiece if you are interested in powers adventure action then you must watch this so basically there is girl who have powers and she use her powers for good work and help others she put superhero costume so that no one can recognize her that all want to say ', ' opening of the show is pretty well organized and presented like characters introducing and developing of the well known story it pushes you to watch one after another episode about the acting think jon bernthal is becoming good actor and am very pleased with his acting in punisher also amber rose revah did terrific job enjoyed watching her on the screen however think this show is made for younger generations despite nasty scenes for us experienced movie and tv show gores some of the scenes may be bit to naive to believe in all in all this is good action tv show and will for sure watch the next season ', ' far too much hate online for this marvel installment it was fun buddy movie the women held the story together well the action was fun and the vfx were not as bad as other recent marvel productions the marvels has 3 protagonists each with their own important arcs great to see ms marvel come to the forefront she a charming young actress with great comedy timing she will be the heart of the new avengers team m sure of it sam jackson was great too but this movie did seem to ignore all the events from secret invasion could ve done without the musical interlude in the middle tbh took me right out of the adventure but otherwise have no complaints ', ' thought of black widow as the perfect spy with mysterious past and heart of steel now know she is terrible spy cries lot and grew up in ohio 3 stars because scarlett johansson is pretty and ll quickly forget this movie ever happened ', ' as it connects to the lines up with all the movies and tv show it really is an amazing tv series as hole ', ' m interested in watching it on disney hotstar once the movie started it turned out had watched it before don know why forgot had seen it before but then couldn stop watching it again it is very good movie this is the first time am posting review on imdb because initially was hesitant to watch it due to the review score not being very high believe it deserves much higher score so here am the action sequences are thrilling and all the main characters delivered powerful performances the character development and emotional depth really make the movie different and very good one to watch love it ', ' really liked the film it is interesting exciting and most importantly fast paced and although the film is whole two and half hours but they shed as one instant and also importantly it is distinctive subtle humor that makes you smile throughout the film definitely one of the best marvel movies in my opinion ', ' this is the first time for any mcu marvel tv show or movie that ve never watched upon release in fact didn know the show came out until day after it came out after knowing that the show was released still didn budge to watch it until 3 months later season 1 was ok good season 2 was just plain boring give all shows or movies fair chance before really judge it now after spending day watching jessica jones season 2 this show was boring the story didn get anywhere the whole show was about umm don even know from what saw it was just women being angry and yelling and for the first time as well skipped few episodes just to see the finale that has never happened to me before ever jessica jones season 2 for me was boring tried to give it chance but it did nothing for me season 3 was an automatic skip ', ' the two female leads are utterly awful on screen together listening to johannsen pugh speak their lines was like nails on chalkboard and only one quarter as interesting the middle act is painful to watch and grinds the movie to halt the only high points is the humor david harbor injects and the taskmaster character the taskmaster was well done despite the deviation from his comic origins and had some great action scenes you ll watch this movie then just like most of the other marvel movies never watch it again ', ' jessica jones is what happens when you strip off superhero spandex and explosions taking away the flash of hollywood block busters puts great burden on both the plot and actors and jessica jones excels in both the series is must see for anyone who likes good thriller rather than using superpowers or alien gadgets the main character search for the villain is good old fashioned pi work the superpower that has the most relevance to the plot mind control of the wonderfully evil villain kilgrave played by david tennant is not used in quest to destroy the world but rather to pose difficult ethical questions what would you do if you had the ultimate power who can be redeemed 13 episodes leaves no time for fillers keeping the plot moving fast the cinematography is also great ', ' it ok for kids but the problem is that we have to watch these show to be able to follow up with the movies it not bad it just kind of lava girl and shark boy or mini spies ', ' it is hard to find movie where actresses perform tremendously at fighting this one so far is the best one have ever watched beyond that this has been little bit more of marvel specialty fights hard to kill villains massive destruction happy ending future movies fragment found it very cool how they introduced new female character to the mcu ', ' was waiting for the avengers ever since heard that they would make movie with this theme and scenario having watched all the previous films with the superheroes that supposedly would form the first avengers team thor iron man captain america hulk have to admit that was very anxious as some of them didn quite leave up to my expectations although to be honest my expectations sometimes can be quite high the movie didn disappoint me at all the lines and the acting of everyone involved think were ranging from very good to exceptional the movie doesn bore you with the background of its characters since you are supposed to be already aware of their past and the combat scenes think that they had the right amount of humor and action to make them fan wet dream therefore highly recommend to everyone fan or no fan to watch it and now all we have to wait is prometheus and dark knight rises ', ' another marvel title that has suspiciously high rating despite the overwhelming number of well written negative reviews the only way this is over an 8 is if someone rigged the system like with punisher which is good but also not nearly as good as its rating really wanted to like this and after giving up on it the first time around went back and re watched the first few episodes of season 1 when season 2 came out yawn found myself on my phone and finally fast forwarding sections of it way too slow there are no likeable characters here especially jessica jones too much good tv out there to waste time on this next ', ' thought could watch it but coudnt get past 1st episode childish and stupid the marvel avengers magic is missing bland dialoges predictable story and substandard plot lead is ok else mind nubbing boring ', ' this movie made me cry not because of any sad scenes but because of it made me see black widow as person knew for so long and made me miss her even more now this movie is not for casual fans it for people who love her and mean natasha not scarlet johansson ', ' the only real reason can move this up from one star to two star is because think kamala is good character however everything else about this show is just boring and found myself not interested at all as massive mcu fan myself found myself not even excited to watch another episode of this show which was shocking to me because watch everything that comes from the mcu will say the first episode was really good and they should ve kept with that style of directing for the entire series but for some reason they decided to change all of that really wish they could ve made better story here ', ' non action non smart just generic girls power flick with horrid acting aside from few cases common in 2021 but it not cinema don waste your time ', ' captain marvel is another entertaining superhero adventure maybe the most important is not the top notch special effects but the humor and chemistry of the cute brie larson and the veteran samuel jackson the screenplay could be improved with better development of carol danvers and the alien war but anyway it is worthwhile watching my vote is seven title brazil capit marvel captain marvel ', ' agent carter is by far the best one shot amazing action and even nice reveal thats important for the whole story of the mcu it doesn really make sense with the tv show though but yea still active one shot ', ' wanna say that no one mean no one should ever bet against kevin feige he is the man who had framed the entire mcu for which he had been rewarded lot of times by the marvel fanbase for me captain marvel was really cool experience and to be honest liked it more than wonder woman which is an overrated piece of crap carol danvers is one the funniest characters of mcu she is witty she is awesome and she is beautiful af go watch it and decide for yourself ', ' don know why people didn like this movie like what did you expect drama and deep stories with plot twists its an action movie based on comic book its good marvel movie not the best but id give it 10 because its exactly what came for ', ' one of best marvel tv show all around the world when started to watch this show am not big fan of daredevil but when finish watching this serial become big fan of it go watch and be fan of daredevils now am very excited about season two and the defenders show can wait to finish them asap and write review about them ', ' captain marvel has what it takes to meet the mcu standards no more nor less than most other dishes marvel has been feasting us with for over the last decade plot with simple typical superhero storyline decent visual with great cgi that indulges audience eye and always some good humour at the right moment so all features have made the mcu brand today that could be summarized in one word entertaining and yes captain marvel is as highly entertaining as any other mcu product that why have trouble understanding all the negative user feedback and all the dislikes this movie has gotten especially from mcu fan 5 6 on imdb on its opening day it true that it is not as fascinating as the first avengers when we first saw the whole team together on screen or the last one avengers infinity war where we had bad ass unstoppable villain who wiped out half of the universe seriously we just cannot expect marvel to do the same 5 times year but giving it 2 or 3 10 and saying this movie has ruined the mcu that something could not agree on it obviously not on the same level of disaster as bay famous transformer saga as went to see this movie expecting for something entertaining in the simplest and plainest meaning of this word have nothing to complain about if you re looking for the same thing for your movies time captain marvel would not be bad choice otherwise if you want something more more story with more human superhero more acting performance more emotion you rather watch nolan batman or more recently marvel superhero series on netflix daredevil and the punisher are the best s one thing did agree with the criticism is the invincibility of captain marvel she for sure will share the bottom position with superman in my interesting superhero list ', ' sorry scrambled egg no offend fighting scenes would be the eggs cool enough but they re just industrially produced not only baldly mixed but poorly seasoned lack of salt and pepper the dish is tasteless after watching it forgot how to spell emotion the family connection is the pity small amount of butter which being put in the pan at first seems to be sunshine yellow in the trailer though are not buttery at all and have gone rancid where is that richness creamy of the butter that suppose to melt my fragile little heart this scrambled egg itself is mediocre not to mention the woven basket it is served in along with pastry brush all the aspects don work together to become distinctive delicious and nutritious dish as friendly customer of the mcu restaurant am truly disappointed and regret eating this horrible so call scrambled egg note the villain is joke and black widow is lacking bit of everything give it five not four because it could have been better ', ' why is bw 2021 woke first of all there aren any good men to see here guys are either stupid antagonistic or outright evil on the other side there is the sisterhood feeling which the movie even explicitly mentions there were two men and around twentysome women in the theatre my young friend dragged me into it and wanted her to be happy so there sat and wondered who would make such an imbalanced type of movie having strange idea of genders is one thing but it was also about character development and character interaction johanssons performance and storyline was fine but that of her family far less so there was no chemistry between the members at time although the story has few explanations loved to see rachel weisz again but felt she lacked screentime florence pugh is different generation and the youngest of the three and felt reminiscences of the usual teenage flick out there something try to avoid in my spare time it not bad acting but can stand the mix of sassiness sarcasm and negativity the whole movie was written in james bond style it had it all and there was no need for having superheroes in it with just few adjustments to the script it was bond script in disguise of marvel superhero movie let just add that there are only few cross references to other marvel content bond movies have the disadvantage that they are both stereotypical and predictable likewise we get to see expensive sets and locations the chase gets bit old though after while when it comes to style and editing this is state of the art it all beautiful and well colored but just as already stated there are about one or two sets more than it good to sum it up it was at once entertaining but it also drained my nerves to watch anything like this in the future one last thing in times of covid we re forced to wear masks this contradicts movies in 3d yet it can be hard to see anything with foggy glasses the effects weren bad but they were not needed either this one is for the girls ', ' it is appropriate that this film was better than the sum of the films that preceded it it is very close to be the best written film of it genre and it ought to be in the oscar running for best screenplay just few redundancies from other films kept this film from becoming great and those redundancies may have been mandatory as this type of film has to be slaved to legacy of comic history it was the first film of it type at least to my knowledge that generated appropriate spontaneous uproarious laughter cheers from the audience from brilliantly surprising scenes and you won see them coming they will just happen the acting is uniformly excellent throughout highly recommended film ', ' marvel has accomplished gathering and teaming up some of the greatest superheroes on the big screen for the first time josh whedon is proved to be one of the best directors for me since this awesome movie has no flaws at all the acting from all the characters is great and the movie is being unwrapped flawlessly this movie contains some of the most amazing action sequences in the history of cinema am really happy for being able to watch this piece of art which am sure will remain for ever in my memory for all marvel fans and non fans this is an extremely recommended movie to watch for this amazing movie my rating is 10 10 ', ' cannot understand her at all like bug in this series ', ' fell asleep this moving had the entertainment value of flock of sheep at least the cinema chairs are comfortable ', ' we are really enjoying this show over at my house lot of people are just hating on it from the looks of it m not going to deep dive in but it very much in line with if the mcu crossed with teen or tween drama show ', ' m not exactly sure get the hype but this movie felt pretty sub par m not an extremist who thinks films should have cult format do enjoy big production though blockbusters have seen better days they basically put together some comic book heroes of some sort and tried to come up with reasonable explanation for having them all participate in the newest world new york saving not good idea the rushed pace to make every character fit the length is easily noticed m no super hero expert quite the opposite but m pretty sure scarlett johansson past doesn involve two parents made of stone so d argue her acting is not at its finest not that the script helps hollywood makes amazing stuff but its stigma of being shallow focused on silliness can be entirely summarized in this particular movie the cheesy lines aiming for climatic humor the grand scale explosions lots of well known names in the cast nothing really stand out because nothing has sufficient time to shine everything feels cramped destruction on this scale demands villain with capital loki is never that guy with the exception of scene that turned out to be faked with johansson character he never looks threatening it hard to tell where everyone came about even the main antagonist himself because every few minutes new super hero pops up on screen the effects are top notch after all expected from blockbuster of this magnitude this might appeal to hardcore fans of comics but can see how anyone would enjoy it beyond that even at being dumb action movie it does pretty awful job ', ' really awful know this wasn supposed to be aimed at me 42yr marvel fan who grew up reading comics in the 80 and 90 but even my 9yr old daughter was bored and didn even want to watch the last few episodes really don know who this was aimed at story is just dull humour is lacking feels like marvel has truly fallen since their earlier phases it just seems like don know how to word it but as if they are focusing on message almost like political propoganda piece as opposed to being interested in telling story that people care about regarding character that people care about don need to put spoilers in here the shows writing spoils it for you please don watch this ', ' it just too much violence and felt my blood pressure getting higher the story at the beginning was interesting but it just not well written story and way too much violence in place of more cerebral intelligent thought from what little did see till decided to stop watching this may not be fair review but don need this adreneline rush well written intelligence empathy humor find lacking here ', ' not gonna lie the movie entertained glad waited to stream would defo have felt swindled had paid to see this in cinemas some fun action scenes and love how unapologetic it was in being what it was an ai written response to the prompt marvel movie for tween girls my research has found that tween girls like kittens sisterhood jump rope musicals being princess and also kicking butt with no real arc it wasn made for me didn fork out to see it don feel it robbed me of couple hours it fine some will love it and that great but it objectively not good movie ', ' cinematography those animations and flow of the show was really well drafted bgm being an indian and person who loves background music of all the english movies tv shows and this one had desi touch the timing and situation of the music was utilized perfectly 10 10 for this storyline 7 10 because villans part was not told well enough to understand them the origin of the bangle was not conveyed properly kamran part was not either conveyed properly actors acting all of them did wonderful job with acting desi touch was just perfect and fantastic vfx as usual good as marvel does their job well with all the graphics and visuals direction 8 10 overall this series will be liked by the teens between 10 20 marvel fans offcourse will be in word of mouth with indians pakistanis typical american crowd would feel only 75 would like it as it has desi touch and people are very selective ', ' if you have hard time sleeping can recommend this garbage to you wanted to leave after only 10 15 minutes but stayed since went to the cinema with friend and didn want leave him by himself at the cinema after some time when saw him with his eyes shut not because he was sleeping but because he just couldn watch any more knew it was time to leave he personally rated the movie as 2 but will be so kind and give this thrash 3 since some of the cgi wasn all that bad this might actually be the worst movie ve ever watched in my lifetime and ve watched quite lot of bad movies recommended for people who has hard time sleeping just bring earplugs so the singing part doesn wake you up ', ' here we have not just another financially disastrous so called flopbuster but the mother of all mcu flopbusters to date with the movie scoring negative records marvel disney did it again they managed to spend too much for an underwhelming final product that would have made sense only as 30 million production going straight to streaming in which case may have awarded higher score not as an aspiring blockbuster which begs the question if they are totally out of touch with reality there at disney the marvels is watchable movie only to stream while waiting for pizza delivery or to take the kids to see but not good enough by long shot to make mature audiences flock to the cinemas to offset the massive production and advertising budget the movie is trying too hard to be funny and lighthearted while wasting what used to be one of the most iconic hollywood actors until he started playing such roles samuel jackson who is reprising mere shadow of nick fury character that use to make billions at the box office not so long ago now he is an inconsequential minor cheerleader orbiting an incoherent bunch of female spandex clad superheroes fighting badly cast totally unconvincing instantly forgettable female arch nemesis simplistic shallow story that we ve seen many times but done way better no suspense disconnected action characters with the depth of pothole no one cares to identify with or remember as soon as the movie is over unnecessary messy cgi with badly done touch of sentimentality and feline cuteness it not worth the fuss just wait for it to stream if you really need to watch pretty average movie the superhero fatigue explanation cannot be the deciding factor here when the product is actually bad and not made to appeal to the masses and thus turn profit ', ' just feminist movie that can be resumed in few words has bunch of girls against their pimp we have submission control revenge union and freedom yep definitely girls focused film ', ' the marvels is about as generic as superhero movies these days come while the chemistry and individual performances are enough to keep me entertained the extremely poor writing and lackluster cookie cutter villain don there plot holes lot fluff and even more choppy transitions that feels like longer more fleshed out film is probably floating out there somewhere kamala khan is by far the light and star of the movie and even captain marvel brie larson gives much better performance than hers from captain marvel the movie unfortunately they both deserved much better movies than what we got you can have fun with this however if the characters aren enjoyable to you you ll find this movie miserable ', ' this is my first review on imdb and just had to do it with daredevil since it is truly remarkable will not give any spoilers so that you can all enjoy it flawlessly as you may already know daredevil is based on marvel superhero of the same name blind lawyer who ends up using his enhanced other senses mainly his audition and fighting skills to fight crime in hell kitchen neighborhood of manhattan in new york city what really defines this show is its solid acting clever and intense action scenes great character development and sheer brutality the latter being something that we are simply not used to see in marvel productions don get me wrong there blood and violence but it is presented in such way that it feels natural and needed daredevil is not all powerful he bleeds and suffers just like everyone else but the fact that he gets up again and again all for the sake of justice is something admirable especially for someone of his condition moreover another key character is developed in this series not as much as the protagonist but enough to make us care about him wanting to see his next actions and of course talking about characters could not go without underlining how special they are the acting is solid and improves as episodes go by feel that charlie cox is in its apex while playing matt murdock whereas his acting as the vigilante daredevil is not perfect it feels like he didn catch all the brutal and somewhat sadistic nature of the character but in his defense this first season could have been about showing us more human daredevil who slowly fortifies his alter ego later on and yes there will be second season the story is not particularly original but it has its great moments and it really becomes compelling still it good enough to avoid criticism while you watch it it all pretty solid and it really builds up into the final episodes the action scenes are memorable mean they are really that superior in comparison to other superhero shows like arrow you feel like the whole choreography of the fights seeks to always keep its focus on what going on without too may cuts hell there one sequence where this becomes evident one cut epic brawl the fighting moves are really satisfying to watch and you will be remembering them long after you finish the show to sum up if you are into different more mature superhero series watch daredevil with great action characters and setting it will keep you wishing for more and more will arrive come into hell kitchen guarantee you won regret it just make sure you are on the right side of law because the devil is here and he is daring he the daredevil ', ' wow so bad m not sure if any of these actors can actually act although the bad guy or girl m not giving away the plot can maybe act maybe oh this is bad maybe it would work in comic book where they can string it out for several months and actually have characters with personalities did the actors actresses ever see each other or were they only added via green screen and post production sometimes it looked like they weren in the same room spaceships could be from buckaroo banzai script is from marcel marceau terrible horrible please no sequel ', ' if you truly are marvel fan this movie is perfect for you it started out slow trying to build up the character and the story but finished off with blast ', ' it an interesting movie even if you ve not seen all of the many strands that lead up to it lot of the key elements have no emotional resonance though if you ve not seen suspect the ms marvel small screen series the hawkeye small screen series nor the wandavision series that quite bit of pre reading is it not d seen all the stuff leading up to endgame and then the wandavision series think quantumania also saw along with black widow this big screen effort was just as entertaining as those two thought at worst there are far too many in joke moments that fall flat for the uninitiated at best it is different having three lasses as your protagonists in superhero movie each performer is committed to their respective roles and the big bad does their absolute utmost with what material they had danvers main plot point is given an afterthought treatment although larson makes even this go long way it a sacrifice made for having 3 main characters each only gets 1 3 of the run time worth of attention look it a fun movie had no problem with it ', ' was hooked on the punisher comics during the eighties and have enjoyed all 3 movies multiple times since they where made ve been waiting eagerly on this show since the announcement and been re watching the movies over the last weeks to get ready for binge watching the series on netflix unfortunately it was total letdown after sitting trough the first six episodes and getting bored to death with drama talking more talking and more talking people mixed with continues meaningless flashbacks finally gave up and fast forwarded trough the remaining episodes only to slow down and see the last episode fully did not miss thing the show might be called the frank castle drama before he becomes the punisher but it is definitely not the punisher this is like buying 13 copies of the punisher comic and there are only the punisher worthy action and punishment 1 page every 3 comic books there are maybe enough material in the 13 episodes for 2 proper the punisher episodes like jon bernthal as an actor and in the few scenes where he are allowed to act with the presence of the punisher its really good but then of course there is flashback and he end up talking to someone for 5 10 minutes wont give this 1 because its at least an attempt on the punisher but cant stretch this higher than 3 and first ever review written 5 minutes after seeing the last episode so yea this was letdown ', ' didn know was going to watch religious show what is happening to you marvel we need action and good story line especially for important characters as ms marvel bad ', ' after demolishing westernizing and hurting the traditions and sentiments of hindus and our cultures in eternals marvels are not only hyped the you know who cultures and strong story lineup for pakistanis this is really insulting to our country ', ' was debating whether to give this 5 or 6 and kind of want to go with 5 but ll go with 6 to slightly counter some of the absurd scores here though know it futile the movie is little boring for marvel movie and certainly no masterpiece but what really don understand are all the people going on about this being too feminist movie or whatever m guy and hate third wave feminism but unless simply having female main character with superpowers alone is enough to automatically make movie feminist movie which imo is super dumb obviously some movies have male main characters some have female ones some have both like so what then m not seeing what makes this movie so feminist there maybe like one scene can think of that has that undertone and that it people are tripping seriously other than that the story was okay to me the directing bit meh and the acting so so samuel jackson is great as always though more importantly though the action felt lackluster which was my biggest disappointment the comedy was good though far from as good as in some of the other movies but still all in all the movie is kind of meh as far as marvel superhero movies go but it certainly no atrocity as some people seem to want us to think d suggest watching it just to understand how carol denvers fits in when avengers endgame comes out ', ' don understand people calling this the worst marvel movie this is said almost everytime new marvel movie release happens ex thor love and thunder if you are die hard marvel fan this isn the greatest one they ve made but it better than other recent releases in this movie fans are able to get better feel for the newer characters like monica and the khan family the special effects were amazing majority of the time with only few looking below average there are lot of laughs for younger kids 12 and under if you want to see movie regardless of if you re marvel fan or not this is decent watch would definitely rewatch for the cats would recommend for the average viewer note there is small amount of cursing so be aware of that if you are taking children but it is kept to minimum ', ' was glued to the screen john bernthal performance was was amazing the story line was great simply the best marvel series on netflix ', ' average movie below average story line taskmaster character ruined acting performance of every character is very good ', ' this latest marvel film has carol danvers brie larson team up with monica rambeau teyonah parris and kamala khan iman vellani also known as ms marvel after chain of events that fuses and intertwines the three super powers together oh yeah and nick fury samuel jackson is here too still find it hard to believe we are where we are today with this cinematic universe let start off with what thought was alright iman vellani as kamala khan is just great casting choice like she carried her show the heart of this movie is definitely her she has wonderful comedic timing and childish charm guess carol and monica reunion were fine too although not given enough focus and attention for it to stick for change the post credit scene was fantastic in my opinion it reignited my hype for what to come other than that am afraid this film really didn stand chance there is scene here that absolutely baffled me where the movie just shifts into musical yup you read it right the dialouge was just so over the top cringe and just didn suit the characters at all nick fury here is just in for comic relief which is alright to do so but with the correct character see zero comparison with the nick we saw in secret invasion versus the nick in this film the villain here is forgettable she has no compassion to her cause and is just plain boring cgi here was standard not the worst have seen and not really impressive find recent mcu films have these bland visuals that don carry the name and spectacle that is the mcu not my favorite not even close going forward hope we will see films or tv shows that do justice by these beloved characters ', ' started to watch this series totally on the basis that david tennant was in it iw was roller coaster ride to say the least it is great change of character for david from doctor who but he is very believable as killgrave found the rest of the cast very talented as well this really is dark gritty and violent series but many shows are my only dislike was that the plot did become predictable as the series progressed could probably watch anything with david tennant in it as he is truly wonderful actor it does take an ensemble cast that meshes well to make good story and overall this cast does just that overall it was good series ', ' her powers should be from terrigan cloud and her powers should be similar to mr fantastic both of these key factors are not true so the show sucks it also riddled with to much modern garbage it an inaccurate try hard piece of garbage ', ' hated it the bit with the wall and the sledge hammer went way too long we get it he got lot of rage daredevil and luke and jones had lot of rage too but this is twice as violent with quite violent scary music to add to it he delivering killing blows with the hammer but the guy who should have broken back is crawling couldn make it through the first ep hate this for what it says about and does to our society we re in bad way already why make it worse marvel ', ' through one episode the show is not bad reminds me on cw show bit though star girl is the first thing that came to mind solid acting ok special effects and great music it not so woke that it deserves 1 but the 10s are either fake or indian folks who are loving the representation ', ' since when thor the great the hammer wielding god who is associated with thunder lightning storms and massive strength the protector of mankind takes orders from one little snot capten america and follows that orders since when capten america is above all since when we must see all that crap for raising up the american backbone enough god of thunder the vicking god from the german mythology canot kneel down to capten america also since when capten america is above hulk and iron man loki and thor ohhhh now see it because he has the american flag at his chest and loki how can he loose from capten america loki is god so it is good for spending time and laughing with the director making movie for capten america the greatest all because he is wearing an american flag and generally for raising up the american morality grow up and make story as it should be we are not americans all over the earth also the movie has parts for laughing when starts the monologues the american boy as leader if you are american you would be very proud of the movie if not leave it up to you ', ' this movie had some great and funny parts but they could of down so much more with the sub plot the villain in this film is so boring that keep forgetting her name and there were couple edited scenes that didn make any sense without adding any spoilers the audience will see for itself what messy and chaotic film this is but some parts are entertaining there are still some of that marvel magic which is appealing and the post credit scene did make me say wow out loud most memorable moment was when nick fury shouted out black girl magic laughed hard at that but don worry not spoiler it worth watch but don expect anything special ', ' the thing about bad plots is that they can improve they can grow over time and draw us in the thing about bad actors is that they won improve unless they re child actors and attending stage school on the side this cast doesn have that luxury the main characters are not all that bad but the side support operatives kin awful please please please kill them off so can enjoy this show as whedon would have us enjoy it m brit and can begin to tell you how irritating the posh accents are are all americans so stupid they don understand regional dialect we have to put up with your central drawl and nyc yo bo accents and we deal with it can you really not live without your brits all sounding like the queen butler ', ' it took days of trying to watch before finished the first few episodes the plot is boring story drags and animations are not great it might be good show to have on in the background but not great one to actually try to pay attention to ', ' when jessica jones first came out on netflix three years ago it became surprise hit in an evolving shared universe between the mcu and the marvel tv shows with shows like daredevil iron fist and the punisher all leading up to the defenders which was meh it has made krysten ritter household name and has developed cult following ', ' let keep this short and simple if the infamous playstation game gave her better origin story and actually depicted her powers correctly in comparison to this series there a problem the showrunner should have picked up few more comic books from someone who comes from culturally similar background the only thing that this show gets right is that itself but it not enough to save this series ', ' luv this character when was kid have to buy more comics bout this character im so excited now ', ' m the kind of fan that can tell you the creation story of venom can tell you all the names of thanos elite team used in the movies and also the less known characters ve known about ms marvel since she was created and was excited about ms marvel mini series would have set up this show for the true fan and casted an arabic girl that is cute great physical shape and black belt that can portray as non fighter early on she will need to have believable moves by the end of the series if you want believability of her fitting in on superhero team in the future what we were given gave me something never had until now superhero show that me and my 10 year old daughter wait for every week she has never willingly watched superhero movie or series with any focus until kamala khan she loves it she still tells her older superhero fan brother who hates what the masses tell him to hate he wont watch any disney miniseries because of negative reviews he finds that she doesn like ms marvel the family dynamics we re failure for me the mom and grandma in pakistan were just dreadful don understand why grandma needs to be so witty with her slams to everyone above anything else don want the marvel era to end the way the mutant era did don screw up she hulk like her too message to disney if you want to watch the marvel brand wither away just put scarlet witch in another movie that makes her look like an idiot make her hero there will be no forgiveness if she is killed off ', ' was excited to hear about ms marvel coming out but was very disappointed with the way this was made too much emphasis on the middle eastern tradition little bit of it would ve been fine but about half of the movie was about the culture thing when watch marvel movie want to watch marvel movie and not national geographic acting is also sub par compared most other marvel actors ', ' the marvels is fun often silly romp elevated by committed performances from the leads iman vellani and her on screen family were highlights of the often underwhelming ms marvel so it great to see them all again here brie larson puts in another charismatic performance as captain marvel nicely balancing her cockiness and rashness clearly attributes she had even before she became ultra powerful and unlikely to to be softened by it with humour and endearing awkwardness teyonah parris as monica is the brains of the trio and the chemistry and camaraderie between these three lead actors is what makes it so engaging plus samuel jackson as nick fury is of course always ridiculously cool it probably the case that lot of what happens here won make lot of sense if you ve not seen lot of the previous mcu adventures particularly captain marvel ms marvel and wandavision and despite the world ending threat it seems somehow insubstantial but it doesn take itself too seriously and has wacky comic book vibe and found it an enjoyable watch there been way too much mcu content churned out in recent years and it seems likely that some of these characters won get another outing as result of probably overdue cull but think that would be pity do hope we ll get to see their continuing adventures ', ' someone give low point just because the main character it islam or it a really teen movie but for me is really cool and really fun hope there more scene for ms marvel ', ' by now clearly no one expects marvel to produce anything decent that is making profit at the box office but with this movie marvel disney has outdone itself this movie is an incoherent unmitigated disaster that was so expensive and has such bad box office result that this might actually be final breaking point for the mcu the story the villain and the main characters are complete mess the dialogues are cringy and the only positive thing is that this is one of the shortest if not the shortest mcu movie it was the quivalent of root canal surgery done by blind plumber who ate too much garlic for dinner one can only hope that marvel will wake up when this movie as predicted will have the worst box office result ever but at this point really doubt that ', ' the highly anticipated ms marvel tv series has finally graced our screens bringing to life the beloved comic book character kamala khan heralded as groundbreaking addition to the marvel cinematic universe mcu the show aimed to showcase diversity and representation while delivering an exciting superhero narrative however after watching its debut season it becomes evident that ms marvel falls short of its lofty goals leaving fans and critics alike with sense of disappointment one of the most glaring issues with the series is its inconsistent pacing the first few episodes meander along taking their time to establish kamala khan origin story her pakistani american heritage and her everyday struggles while character development is crucial the excessive focus on kamala mundane life takes away from the superhero narrative that viewers signed up for it isn until the mid season mark that the series gains some momentum and even then the pacing remains uneven making it difficult to become fully invested in the plot moreover the writing fails to live up to the complexity that mcu fans have come to expect the dialogue often feels clich and lacks the wit and charm that have become trademarks of marvel cinematic successes this is particularly evident in the interactions between kamala and her friends which come across as forced and unnatural the attempts at humor often fall flat further undermining the show ability to engage its audience while the series does attempt to address important themes such as identity representation and cultural pride it does so in heavy handed manner instead of organically weaving these themes into the narrative the show often resorts to overt exposition and preachy dialogue this not only disrupts the flow of the story but also undermines the impact of the intended messages viewers are left feeling like they re being lectured to rather than being allowed to explore these themes alongside the characters another significant letdown is the lackluster portrayal of kamala khan powers in the comics ms marvel shape shifting abilities are central and visually dynamic aspect of her character however the tv series seems to struggle with translating these powers onto the screen effectively the special effects fall short making the transformations appear clunky and unconvincing this undermines the sense of wonder and spectacle that should accompany superhero show furthermore the supporting characters fail to leave lasting impression kamala friends and family members often come across as one dimensional and stereotypical lacking the depth and nuance that could have added layers to the narrative even the show main antagonist while promising in concept feels underdeveloped and fails to evoke sense of genuine threat casting though praised initially for its diversity presents its own set of problems iman vellani portrayal of kamala khan is earnest but her performance at times lacks the gravitas needed to anchor the show it clear that she has potential but the writing and direction sometimes let her down supporting cast members also struggle to fully embody their characters further contributing to the overall lack of chemistry and authenticity on screen significant issue that cannot be overlooked is the lack of cohesive and compelling central conflict while superhero stories thrive on the clash between well defined hero and villain ms marvel falters in this aspect the antagonist motivations and actions remain murky robbing the show of strong driving force this leads to an anticlimactic finale that fails to deliver the emotional payoff that viewers had been hoping for in conclusion the ms marvel tv series falls short of the high expectations set by its source material and the marvel cinematic universe from its inconsistent pacing and lackluster writing to its struggles with translating superpowers onto the screen the show struggles to find its footing while it attempts to address important themes it does so in heavy handed manner that disrupts the narrative flow the characters though diverse lack depth and fail to establish meaningful connections with the audience ultimately ms marvel is missed opportunity to create compelling and engaging addition to the mcu leaving fans with sense of disappointment rather than excitement for what to come ', ' now tv show with great actors development of characters lack of all kind of actual us themas which rest of world does not want to waste time with it in super hero tv show and last but not least real enrichment to character of daredevil itself like gotham was just horrible in any sense but penguin got real blast to figure itself daredevil is pure joy to watch best action fighting have seen so far especially as it is just netflix tv show daredevil is brilliant side remark if dragon fist would just have half such great lead actors ', ' jessica jones is slut that has trouble with the truth taking it out on the bottle and the first thing she sees trying to be normal because she is super and none of it makes any sense becomes detective on real easy cases because she is so easy it plain to see that she was created by woman as it involves no action just mental issues and fornicating with no bounds whilst still trying to make it into the pg 14 time slot like an innocent twist of twilight into the darkness of hell kitchen seems lot of series and movies are just for unrealistic inter racial porn this one seems to want to push that boundary since have never seen action like that in comic book by marvel rate this 1 only because rating is required wrote this because m compelled to warn people about wasting their time ', ' disney takes down captain marvel further evisceration of the marvel franchise overall this looked as though it was filmed for the disney channel and should not have been allowed on the big screen it should have been disney channel exclusive in that way would have been spared the half hour spent watching in disbelief o didn know that it would be musical they could have used the intro for the lion king that would have been at least interesting to listen to should have left what was scripted on the cutting room floor also maybe one scene with the alien cat there was no need for more dry stale no substance humor if there was any fell flat didn even smile once acting was sub par the story line revolved around bracelets okay then didn hate it didn like it didn even finish the first half hour o well alright then everything is normal for disney vomit nothing to see here next ', ' this is would call real content don much words just well done marvel you have my heart ', ' have never written review of movie before but this film was so infuriating that had to first off bri larson acting the entire movie was just bad she did not fit the role whatsoever secondly the story arc of her trying to figure out who she is for more than half the film when we already know she is one of the strongest hero of the mcu because we were told that many times was just flat out boring thirdly the villain of the film was who the kree ronan every good super hero film has good villain and that was not apparent in this film whatsoever the mcu has been building up an entire story arc for 10 years with every movie all leading up to endgame in infinity war all the avengers teamed up and they were still not able to defeat thanos but now capitan marvel is just going to come in and save the day because she the strongest avenger after having just one film 2 months before the release of endgame that literally belittles every movie prior to this one and also the continuity with the mcu is just bad lastly everything in this film felt so forced especially all the feminist propaganda the kept shoving down our thoats the entire film this movie wouldn have been nearly as bad had it come after endgame but it did and if capitan marvel is the one to defeat thanos they literally ruined the entire 10 years of the mcu ', ' went to the premiere quite apprehensive on several counts will robert downey jr ever get back to the brilliance of iron man 1 or have cocky dialogs won over cool plot mark ruffalo as the hulk why not edward norton hawkeye not superhero but just guy with good aim black widow no powers again is she just for eye candy will hemsworth get more screen time and better plot than what thor offered him loki the main villain is this going to be yet another thor vs loki battle with the others just chipping in will too many superheroes dilute the plot will they be eating up each other screen time is technology going to win against good storyline once again ref all the other transformer films except the 1st so many of them will iron man hold fort in the team honestly didn even care for evans and captain america as much as did for thor iron man and must say with the runtime being 145 minutes wondered if it would be drag the verdict the movie takes time to settle into the plot setting up the characters unlike thor were felt the movie just rushed through and could have been so much more the film is larger than life unlike iron man 2 or captain america which left me wishing they had done more loki does great job of portraying the villain thor delivers black widow hawkeye are manageable but nothing can compare to the fact that ruffalo actually fits this version of hulk way better than norton could have done and of course iron man rocks rocks like he never did by the time you reach the second half the story has built in enough punch to make you wish there was an epic battle to follow and not lame effort and it does deliver great action lot of mayhem every superhero getting his screen time hulk iron man indeed steal the show good dialogs well timed comic quips here and there perfect start to the 2012 13 tent pole league now if only the hobbit dark knight rises keep up to this level its gonna be great year ', ' this movie could have been anything and it would have made this much money they could have written almost any plot and the charismatic collection on screen would have made it good it is almost an accomplishment that joss whedon and co produced this instead the general reaction to this spectacle almost made me wonder if had watched different movie most of my friends seemed to like and the critical reviews were positive enough critics and audiences alike seemed to think it had delivered on its promises my biggest impression walking away was did half that movie take place on an aircraft carrier that can fly ll save you the trouble precisely 70 minutes of this 140 minute film takes place on flying aircraft carrier it is so precisely half the movie that am certain it was done on purpose this was an appalling waste of potential in every sense ', ' pros truly amazing antagonist who is really the star of the show excellent story characters have real substance values and purpose brilliant music every season sees improvements in cinematography environments and props look awesome action scenes rock season 3 is masterfully written one episode in particular is the best hour of tv ve ever witnessed we re talking red wedding level good cons overall watch it ', ' thought would give this movie the benefit of the doubt and avoid any reviews before watched it the plot if you can call it that is generic the acting is generic the special effects and cgi are generic there is nothing new here very little character development it just so bland iman vellani is the only standout think she did wonderful job with pretty terrible script teyonah patti as monica rambeau is just forgettable and samuel jackson brings nothing as nick fury sincerely hope marvel at this point just stop making movies they have lost their way the magic is gone and they really really need to go back to the literal drawing board with their movie formula ', ' come one guys it not really their fault that the plot was stupid action scenes boring and characters flat as pancake you forget one important thing this is still time whan kang pulls all the strings neither of those characters had any free will and all their actions were handcrafted by him really at this point it doesn matter al all what happened pre endgame none of the characters could have behaved any differently otherwise they would have been melted ', ' just watched the first episode looks like it could be worth staying with but why the need for lesbian side story why the need for steamy sex scene why such miserable close this episode would have been just as captivating without these unnecessary scenes ', ' now here a film that may just get you scratching your chinny chin chin with some ponderous thinking how on earth could this be polar opposite of glee an abhorrent movie that just not eye catching the acting is awful and the script is so poor the story is daft and an absolute chore your eyes will soon close recline and repose it won be too long before snooze and snore what has happened you ll cry to this great set of flicks they ve removed all the polish now they re missing trick it become mercenary it no longer must see like sensitive place has received big kick ', ' the hate directed toward this film is absurd an honest viewer can possibly believe this is the worst film ever made or even terrible comic book movie or the worst marvel movie ever made folks need to get grip to be clear didn think this was good film the vi8llain is bore and the plot at least in regards to the reason our heroes need to come to the rescue is just not that compelling it also doesn make heck of lot of sense however you don go to films like this for coherence you go for the fun and this picture just isn fun enough the three leads are all fine and some of the jokes are bangers but that just isn enough to raise this above simple okay believe there is very funny off the hook picture in here and wish marvel had been able to find it ', ' as brown coater more so than buffy fan have certain expectations love coulson love fury love lola the teeny bopper slash young uns not so much it not that they don fit but was hoping for cast that would reflect larger gamut of everyday people given that no one is super powered the character depth has to be deep and whedon is no rookie when it comes to that guess would have preferred cast of late 20 somethings to early 30 somethings still it early enough so here hoping for the best ', ' if you like many others have opted out of the past few marvel cinematic universe mcu films and are likewise suffering from superhero fatigue but are now looking for re entry into the mcu then the marvels is the film for you for unlike some previous mcu films it does not take much in the way of previous knowledge to get into the flow of this somewhat lightweight fun action comic book flick academy award winner brie larson returns as captain marvel and is joined literally with monica rambeau teyonah parris who superhero origin story can be found in the disneyplus tv series wandavision but is summed up pretty quickly here so you ll get the drift as well as young ms marvel iman vellani who origin story is told in the disneplus tv series ms marvel but who story is summed pretty quickly and pretty well here they join forces to fight villain dar benn zawe ashton intent on inflicting revenge punishment on captain marvel also along for the ride is good ol samuel jackson as nick fury in his 15th appearance in an mcu vehicle they all bounce around the scenarios with winking knowledge and earnestness about what kind of movie they are making and with which what tone they need to hit in the hands of director nia dacosta the 2020 remake of candyman the marvels moves along at brisk pace injecting some humor and decent enough action sequences and cgi mixed in with clever segment or 2 one scene set to classic musical theater song is worth the price of admission in and of itself there is enough light breezy sequences and banter that the main word that comes out of this film is fun dacosta succeeds very well with fun in this film where she doesn succeed as well is in emotional heft captain marvel is given few self reflective moments and while larson is terrific actor and tries to succeed with these moments they didn feel earned so they fell flat unfortunately the other characters are there to battle and throw off one liners and not much more wisely dacosta limits this film to 1 hours and 45 minutes the shortest mcu film to date and this is positive for she just gets to it and doesn linger on any of the moments that don work or would fall apart if anyone had anytime to think about them and of course the extra scenes an mcu staple set up 2 new franchises so you want to stick around for them but you don need to stick around to the end of the credits all in all ms marvel is fun lightweight romp that will entertain for the time you are in the cineplex but not much more but isn that what going to the movies is all about letter grade 7 1 2 stars out of 10 and you can take that to the bank ofmarquis ', ' not like other marvels cgi crap this thing is actually masterpiece thats what superheros should be best thing ever created by marvel ', ' it a solid introduction to this new character best scenes in the movie are the ones in space the action is pretty good there some good chemistry between larson and jackson bit dull in the middle of the story but it picks up in the final act overall good and solid entry in the mcu ', ' forced myself to keep watching the first episode after that decided not to return for episode 2 then about faced deciding to try again but after seeing kamala ecstatically salivating over the new guy in episode 2 called it quits too much teen angst too disneyesque too unrealistic and too little marvel almost turning this new superhero discovery and utilization of her powers into an afterthought more of the storyline seemed to be devoted to kamala struggling to get her religiously conservative parents to accept her desire to embrace the freer customs of their new country might be good for young teens but not for me ', ' kamala is an inhuman she gets her powers after exposure to the terrigen mist not from magical bangle plus her main power is manipulating her body shape shifting elasticity similar to mr fantastic in fantastic four not some sort of cheap green lantern knock off the only thing they manage to get right is the religion and culture part of her story really wanted this to be good but the show is very disappointing and boring at times ', ' oh dear lord where do start guess ll start by wishing they had made the best portrayal of the punisher into better movie which was punisher war zone ray stevenson nailed the character perfectly of course everything else about the movie was subpar but you have to give credit where credit is due the first thing they screwed up on was continuing the origin story which was senseless frank origin story was perfectly set up in daredevil he didn need anymore origin than that on top of that it turned into some sort of spy drama that was totally off key with the character so he basically jason bourne with ptsd or something the second thing they screwed up on is the fact the punisher kills bad guys that pretty much all he does and he doesn do it for some clandestine reason or even for revenge he does it because he hates bad guys what was expecting was just that punisher killing bad guys what got was long boring drawn out story with meh climax that brings the character right back to square one in need of reason to kill bad guys which was supposed to have been established in daredevil the third thing they screwed up on is forgetting to add likable characters liked curtis and liked micro wife and kids other than that could care less who lived or died and the fourth thing they screwed up on not the last thing but the last thing ll mention they forgot that the punisher is comic book character this guy exists in world where bruce banner gains several hundred pounds of shear muscle in matter of seconds where iron man can take hit with ballistic missile hit the ground at over 100 miles per hour and live where black widow can jump from captain america shield and grab onto speeding flying craft and not have her arms ripped out of her socket etc the punisher has no place in true reality so why the hell are we trying to make this show as realistic as possible in the comics the punisher has stood toe to toe with the likes of wolverine he bested daredevil spider man and wolverine all at the same time he a master on the fly strategist who by shear brilliance ferocity and ruthlessness gets the upper hand on practically every opponent he takes out entire battalions of mercenaries as if taking casual sunday stroll and then nukes their headquarters for good measure now m not saying that tv show should emulate those kinds of beyond belief feats of comic book fantasy to that extent but one would hope that the show would at least realize that frank castle aka the punisher was comic book character and the charm of comic book character is that they re larger than life they are not bound by the same rules and laws of physics that we mere mortals are and their sole purpose of existence is to be the star of fantastic stories that are beyond the scope of this reality these stories are form of escapism break from the real world and by trying to make the series ultra realistic they completely negate the entire purpose of these characters suffice it to say the show was major disappointment and ll not be watching the 2nd season or any season until these writers realize what comic book story how comic book hero is supposed to be ', ' just bad movie bad plot the acting was super bad ', ' the punisher is one of the only believable heroes in the marvel universe and watched this series because he my favorite and should receive lot more hype but this series is mind numbing all of it stinks of low budget the acting and the story are completely forced and unnatural and the progression and plot points are really bad and leave you with sour aftertaste watch this series only if you re big fan of the punisher or you like low budget action series with nonsensical plot wish who made this had read all the source material on the punisher and made decent story with it they wouldn cancel it otherwise lazy work this is why we can have good things ', ' season 1 is brilliant loved every minute of it season 2 was average some good bits but also number of misjudged bits season 3 was awful the film makers completely forgot this was meant to be daredevil programme do yourself favour and stop at season 2 ', ' so florence pugh is really cool for those who have been paying attention for while now that shouldn come as surprise but this being my main take away from this movie is rather sad black widow deserved better entry she been kicking ass ever since iron man 2 and became bit of fan favorite this movie is perfect example of too little too late we ve already seen some of her origin story scattered among other entries in the mcu and then end game happened which was rather definitive ending to the story arc of the original avengers but they promised us black widow movie so here it is guess pro action done quite well they take time to introduce the characters and as said earlier pugh awesome con no real character arc for black widow in her own movie supporting cast of harbour and weisz underused the plot isn very interesting underwhelming finale this one hard to recommend had an okay time watching it and it competently enough made but it doesn have many selling points and if you want more florence pugh there the new little women movie which is much stronger flick okay movie nothing more reluctant 6 10 ', ' but not in good way it basically just compilation of each character from the movies what they are in with instrumental music playing in the background to provoke emotion if this is what you want you can find way way better fan edits online it might improve as the series goes on but m not to convinced ', ' the flow of the show just seemed so fast paced during the whole intro montage of kamala video couldn get what she was saying at all and so spent my time looking at the funny little cutouts and sketches and wondering what this was all about this was not problem with the volume of the show it was definitely the fast pace of speaking and the extremely quick cutaways to various cartoon figures in all the crowd scenes school avengercon had no idea what people were saying when kamala and bruno were speaking alone it was not much better but only when kamala and her mother were interacting did actually understand the words the actors were saying luckily my husband is fan of the comics and could also keep up with the dialogue so he interpreted for me to me this feels more like teen girl disney show from the 2000s rather than marvel show from the 2020s get that they re trying out different things to see what works and showcasing characters that many mcu fans won know about but do think they should slow down bit kamala may speak the way typical teenager speaks but if no one can understand her then it not going to work didn care enough for the story to re watch it and try to grasp it on second viewing ', ' don understand why marvel production made this only first episode gave good stuff then its terrible wand vision loki falcon snd winter soldier hawkeye watching these by without skipping second but here in this was skipping 15 seconds continuously ', ' not one for fans of the mcu it a full on disney show well made but not believable what if someone decides to do show called junior exorcist it wouldn work it doubly doesn work because captain marvel is one of the worst written superheroes and this is just another badly written overpowered and annoying version of the same thing meh ', ' title of my review says it all complete waste of time talent and celluloid enough of these comic book movies already if you ve seen one ', ' would rather see drama movie instead of this movie boring no proper explanation and no interesting action sequences at all don know how mcu made this movie ', ' black widow is that marvel movie which was not even needed the character is dead and now bringing movie about her didn make any sense the whole movie is normal the plot was normal not great the pacing was bad and movie looked long they ruined the taskmaster was excited to see this villian after hearing so much about it but they mismanaged the character marvel is also known for adding jokes in their movies but this movie had stupid jokes you may not even think of laughing of their jokes this movie just had action and nothing else overall this movie was normal marvel movie which you can give try but don expect too much ', ' if you re fan of stretchy ms marvel you re going be very disappointed in this series the character powers are totally different add slow pacing and the usual poor acting associated with child actors with little to no acting experience and this show isn worth watching why don tv and movie producers stick to what makes fans want to read the comics ', ' if this is where the mcu is going they re in trouble the story is boring the characters are not likable and the script is childish had to drag myself through all 6 episodes this is children show if that what they labeled it fine kamala powers are also just uninteresting you had potential to show the history of india and pakistan and the 1940 there and just ignored it this show is mess on all accounts the fact they will have these characters in the new captain marvel movie will only bring it down this should have been one off and geared towards kids not mcu and marvel comic enthusiasts ', ' the movie felt rushed like no one wanted to make it but they had to so endgame makes more sense they started and ended with the feminist message but they didn shove it down your throat which is nice but the movie was still pretty predictable and boring ', ' don normally write reviews but the producers really dropped the ball the second season and it is beyond disappointing the second season has totally different look and feel from the production to the acting as well as the writing haven watched show go this sour since the 4th season of vikings could not make it past the first episode where three quarters of the episode is love story easily the worst piece of trash have watched in the past year they took take great series and destroyed it into piece of pop trash if you think the second season is good then question your sense of reality ', ' series shows the perfect image of brown culture and the way the brown race is treated in west they tried showed the islamic boundaries and conveyed message that every culture should have its on values and we just don try to copy otherss ', ' we started binging daredevil on friday night after seeing him on the truly awful she hulk it was immediately evident though that wouldn be able to watch this show before bed it more violent than any movie ve seen including the godfather and ii impalement gouging crushing dismemberment enraged door slamming blood brain splatter the stories are gripping the characters are not your basic comic caricatures they are all substantive and credible but be forewarned it ain your mother mcu she hulk would be out of place captain america would ve been ridiculed then garroted in ep1 good thing it on disney can easily switch to 101 dalmatians before lights out ', ' just to be clear this is not 1 10 or 3 10 show it clearly made for kids so if you are like me guy in early 20s you are probably not going to enjoy it very much but can imagine someone around 10 15 years can have good time with this show and really it not bad thing to target different audience ', ' super hero afraid of villains ha ha ha if you had watched all marvel movies think about to watch marvel tv shows like this my suggestion pleased don watch this bored season the super hero with no super power very very bored seasons if you wait for when fight come and super hero win than your dream take 13 bored episode to achieve that at least add some vfx that audience love to watch your bored season its boring to see 13 episode you think that some thing interesting come but you disappointed stop watching after 3 episode so much bored shame on marvel disgusting shows ', ' not sure what marvel was going for but to me this one seems to be made for lot younger audience sure hope it gets better as it goes along but the plot on this one makes zero sense ', ' but the majority of the performances were sub par the russian accents were badly done and not convincing at all mainly because of the out of place dad jokes and idiotic humor thrown into the gears out of all the marvel movies this has got to be by far the worst do not recommend even for her backstory it ain worth it ', ' only one episode in but it off to good start iman vellani is ms marvel thru and thru she just plain charming and look forward to seeing more of her in this series and in future mcu projects oh and that supporting cast chef kiss without doubt welcome change of pace after some of the heavier entries into the mcu of late more please ', ' of all the new marvel material since end game this show is the weakest not by far because moon knight was also pretty bad but ms marvel goes to new lows the plot has massive holes in it and all the backstory is just painted with the broadest of brushes acting is pretty bad throughout and the pacing of the show is all over the place there very little to recommend despite the show claiming to bring new ideas and to break with stereotypes ', ' daredevil season 3 worried me at the begging why because of the slow burns of iron fist 1 2 punisher jessica jones 2 and luke cage 1 2 found myself saying here we go again punisher did deliver but not like daredevil 3 here the thing comic book movies tv series walk fine line between trying to make comic book fans movie goers and sci fi fans all happy go to far one way and you hear it from the other side daredevil balances enough for everyone there is great acting insane action intense story this makes for my very favorite netflix marvel series it really just keeps going and you think til the end how is this going to end there is no way it ends good loved the ride it kept me on the edge of my seat give it chance because it really is home run for all this far surpasses its predecessors on the netflix front certainly should be the bar for any upcoming new marvel series ', ' tried to like it but it boring slow and more like pakistani soap opera than marvel show don get any of the culture references and don care particularly about these characters even my son who loves everything mcu he even liked eternals go figure had almost no interest by the end of the second episode 5 minutes of marvel stuff after 30 minutes of uninteresting drama just isn appealing ', ' truly gave this chance but couldn get past even episode 2 the main character is so annoying and eye rolling its just torture to watch it something think even tweens will think is bad and immature marvel is truly going down the tubes atleast spiderman is still good might be thanks to that sony interferes and that scary ', ' if you like plenty of action this is series for you non stop through both the seasons shame it all ends with 2 will miss this one ', ' scoring 5 plot 5 characters 5 acting 5 writing 5 cinematography 5 direction 5 pace tone 0 score 1 special effects 0 cultural impact influence 4 5 total rounded total to 5 ', ' ok this show not the best of mcu film series but it is nice and quite refreshing if you bored with the usual mcu show maybe this show will refresh you ', ' the super hero thing has become too tiresome however there more and more of it it gotten to the point that they re putting out stuff with hardly any acting abilities and cheap cgi from top notch places like marvel disney don like most of the tv shows from either dc or marvel and this looks so much like those shows only it too preechy and seems more about telling the audience over and over again we ve got poc star first the leading actress has no acting career so it teeny bopper disney at its finest which is horrible if you have any love of decent acting secondly the cgi is very bad probably the worst that disney has done which is saying something as it been worse than any film third the storyline is way too cheesy and poorly executed ', ' these film makers really seem to underestimate their audience do they really think they are fooling us this movie was simply about introducing us to the black widow replacement it too bad because thought she earned her own movie about her ', ' ms marvel is an amazing surprise and refreshing outcome for all the marvel fans and general public the art direction is exquisite and the conection and references to the rest of the universe marvel is perfectly done withput stealing the focus of the main protagonist the actress is impressive and every marvel or dc fan will see themselves reflected on her and her story highly recomended no matter your age range love how marvel keep reinventing this stories and giving their own personal flavour ', ' ll start with the bad and then good bad just feel like this movie could ve been much better story was fine and dandy but it just lacked stand out moment of carol danvers being captain marvel it needed spark but it never really gave much it felt like it served more than promotion to avengers endgame than it being captain marvel stand alone movie it just above or maybe just an average film also m kinda agreeing that brie tended to lack emotion throughout the film good acting was great cgi was great as well the marvel formula still pulled off pretty well it empowering especially when portion of the film dedicated to carol struggle in being woman and being in the army that moment where people tell you that you re not what you re supposed to be but you just ignore the naysayers and continue on what you really want to become makes it empowering still good movie tho it just lacked spark d still recommend it especially to those who have been patronizing mcu for while now ', ' it is just amazing how this man mr whedon turns anything into gold although there were some restrains and limits given characters and all to this story mr whedon and all literally everybody involved in production of this movie gave their best and made it one of the best american movies in many years it is however tough job to keep everything in balance superheroes and other childish and trivial stuff producers requests but despite of it mr whedon did it again and exceeded by far all my expectations must note that he is at his best when his hands are not tied firefly serenity or hush from buffy for example and he given full creative freedom but this movie is really something else ve watched all the movies with separate characters involved thor captain america hulk and so on and they were surprisingly good although main characters only here gave their best but this amazing so witty so fun so close to reality making sense as it can possibly be so full of those details that make your eyes sparkle and your brain filling with serotonin mr whedon knows how to pull out the best from anybody he working with such rare and precious gift and so not hollywood maybe that why he is so damn underestimated by hollywood and television mainstream not only highly recommended but must see again and again ', ' best superhero crime show ever period if your fan of superhero or just plain damn good television it a must watch everything from the characters action and plot lines are spot on the character development is something that needs to be applauded at times especially the villains vincent dnofrio is completely intriguing and captivating as wilson fisk kingpin you completely buy him as this character and charlie cox as matthew murdock daredevil was completely made for this role he completely knocks it out of the park just vincent does and don me started on those gritty action sequences just completely jaw dropping and quite frankly brutal at times but in an awesome way its gritty but has heart the quality is very high it the rated version of the batman begins trilogy if they were seasons of tv show but with daredevil of course so bottom line if you want to watch an exciting brutal intriguing and smart show this is it sadly there only 3 amazing seasons hopefully it ll come back one day ', ' this movie is the best in classic way the story of this movie takes place very slowly but very good and will give you deep impact ', ' so amazing such beautiful feminist movie full of gorgeous cinematic shots so in love with everything about this film ', ' cannot believe that marvel has made such an childish type tv series this is not made for ott this should be telecasted on cartoon network the director was not aware of the legacy of the disney think they should revamp the marvel stories otherwise marvel will gey buried under the expectations of the peoples soon ', ' for my purposes this film is the poster child or definition of four star movie it watchable without significant discomfort but serves no purpose it just not enjoyable m saying this as someone who very much liked captain marvel 2019 now 12 year old will likely have different opinion this is merely my take the body swapping schtick is so contrived that it not even fun the first time around if it was d be saying it quickly gets tiresome it just lame and goofy an expression which pretty much sums up the entire film not recommended for most adults will admit the overall message is good especially the ending but thematically speaking it nothing you haven seen before ', ' where is justice where is punishment here in netflix ', ' disney latest affirmative action superhero even manages to steal her first name and line about correcting how it is pronounced from the united states own affirmative action vp this is what happens when adults stop making tv shows and children are given full control if this is liked by gen we have no hope of any sane future ms marvel is unlikeable unrealistic and unattractive it is possibly the most cringe inducing show ever created for the woke generation ', ' exciting how you can build challenging story with many superheroes in all of the superhero universes saw the avengers last didn expect much and m pleasantly surprised the action sequence on the flying aircraft carrier is bombastic let go to part 2 ', ' marvel was marauding with amazing releases they had to get overconfident and bomb something and here it is thought iron fist was the worst ever marvel production ms marvel makes iron fist look better lolzz ', ' m blown away by this film everything hit perfectly loved the smaller cast the family dynamic florence pugh will be perfect addition to the mcu scarlett continues to be incredible weapon for marvel m not going to spoil anything go see this baby asap and ignore the ridiculous haters ', ' it was waste of time the first half of the movie was average where they tried to make some connections with previous marvel movies and brought some of the old villains however the later half of the movie was total disaster it was the worst superhero movies that have ever watched wasted 23 on two tickets to watch this total piece of junk big no no for someone who wants to watch good movie ', ' there is no excuse for show called the punisher to be that boring the plot is very simple yet it takes too much time to start rolling which makes the show almost unwatchable plus there are some really uninteresting subplots that become obstacles to the progression of the show most of the characters are completely bland with the exception of jon bernthal of course which is really shame cause he does fantastic job as the violent and brooding marvel anti hero however the writing is so weak here that you re feeling him more as the punisher in the daredevil s02 involvement now let talk about the gore that everyone is complaining about well these so called violent scenes are nowhere near as heavy as you would thought they are just typical rated scenes especially if you are used to heavy rated the gore of this show would be groundbreaking if it was 2005 overall the punisher doesn live up to it name which is sad cause this show needed to push some boundaries was really trying to keep my eyes wide open except 2 3 times that some action happens and wakes you up but 13 hours are too much and for the most part you feel like you re wasting your time ', ' this movie feels like the story and screenplay were written by men who didn understand women at all which is both bad for movie all about woman and regrettable since technically one of the three people behind writing the story and screenplay was woman it is disappointing that this movie takes one of the strongest women in the marvel cinematic universe and gives her backstory with plot holes somehow the test that got her accepted into shield was unsuccessful but no one thought to check and they never really explain how it takes one of the only women in the avengers and makes her uniquely susceptible to the pheromones of an old man in his sixties which just feels creepy and also rather demeaning to her character it falls victim to one of the classic blunders while it does not enter land war in asia it does take powerful character and make not being able to have children major personality trait this wouldn be bad in and of itself but because they have never made any of the men in the cinematic universe have this sort of an issue or personality trait it does come off as uniquely insensitive and seems to be unintentionally or intentionally don know suggesting that powerful women have portion of their value tied up in whether they can produce children on top of that it gives her backstory that is frankly not nearly as cool as that of practically any other avenger like the family dynamic but you have to admit having three years of fake family and then nothing else other than being ensorcelled by villain and escaping to immediately join shield seems more like the stories given to marvel villains than to actual leading characters she had no agency no character building all she was was girl who did what she was told and then switched sides and did what she was told by the other people no dramatic hero story no with great power comes great responsibility lastly the movie contains lot of filler with action sequences that seem all about blowing random stuff up starting avalanches and stretching out the action instead of actually being unique or including enjoyable super hero fights which is fine in fast and furious movie but not exactly what one hopes for from marvel movie ', ' the show is so well written and acted actually watched some of jessica jones before daredevil and enjoyed it thought daredevil would be of similar quality but nope this is on another level and genuinely great show regardless of whether you re marvel or superhero fan or not m gutted to learn it has been cancelled please netflix this is one show that deserves to be kept alive ', ' if you like your typical action packed superhero movie the avengers is the perfect movie it has action suspense and humor with touch of romance thrown in it has amazing heroes great villain fighting scenes rivalry between hero and villain and an all star cast what it lacks is originality all superhero movies are the same the world has been threatened in some way and superhero must rise to the occasion to overcome the threat the ongoing battle between good and evil which isn any different in this movie what makes the avengers different from other superhero movies is the compilation of characters the world has been threatened once again and we need iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo the black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner to come together and save us as thor brother loki tom hiddleston plans to use glowing cube called the tesseract to open portal bringing an evil alien army to earth to help takeover we have beat loki before in the movie thor now he is back with vengeance unfortunately if you have not seen these movies you will need to catch up as there is not lot of back story on why these heroes were chosen with everything going on you do not really get to understand the characters especially why loki wants to control the world even if you haven seen them you know what to expect and can understand the basic storyline there are no surprises you can plot out the movie before you even watch it overall found the movie to be exiting but explored way too many times the whole idea of needing superhero to come save us has been done before originality is what makes movie great director joss whedon did great job compiling different characters together into one movie even with amazing special effects and compelling characters believe he could have made better storyline with more surprises we should be walking away thinking wow did not expect that to happen the world will continue to want heroes in their lives in movies like the avengers we are given hope that good will always overcome evil which is why m sure they will be coming out with another one soon just hope to be speechless and amazed when it over ', ' there been lot of excitement surrounding the release of this movie with one side wanting it to do well to support their camp and the other side wanting it to fail to support theirs don care about that either way just want to be entertained by good superhero movie which continues the story that marvel has been telling for the last 10 years unfortunately this isn one of the better ones found it to be very mediocre and forgettable and that really as charitable as can be with this movie brie larson certainly looks the part but based upon her performance it seems like she was miscast in the role her time on screen is spent vacillating between looking indifferent and an unidentifiable expression which many have attributed to smugness for most of the movie personally found it to be bit off putting and not only was the carol danvers character unlikable as result it also kept pushing me out of the movie by making it hard to suspend my disbelief unfortunately it goes downhill from here the underlying subtext of the movie is female empowerment which is fine comic books are allegories and always have been at least when it comes to marvel comics it one of the many things love about comics but there a fine line when creating these kinds of stories they still have to be relatable and engaging and ultimately entertaining which is something that the comic book industry does quite well for the most part if you lean little too far towards the underlying subtext then it looks little ham fisted and people perceive it as propaganda and that what happens here it so busy trying to be feminist film that it forgets to be superhero movie it clear that marvel and ultimately disney is trying to capitalise on the current zeitgeist which is bit of departure for them past efforts have been focused more on telling entertaining stories which remained reasonably faithful to the source material this movie doesn do that and as such has different look and feel than its predecessors so much so that it doesn really feel like marvel movie at all an unfortunate side effect of this are the changes made to existing characters both from the source material and the mcu itself in this movie nick fury doesn resemble the character we ve seen over the course of his appearances in 11 of the mcu movies his character is not bad within the context of the narrative they re trying to support but his actions are not congruent with what we ve seen and know about that character on the back of that having him lose his eye to cat is disservice to the character and shows that the filmmakers don really have any respect for the source material or would argue the fans it the casual fan base which underwrites the financial viability of these movies not the fringe elements when you dogmatically service these elements specifically on one side or the other you risk marginalizing the culture we love by forcing out this casual fan base personally enjoyed alita battle angel much more as female empowerment movie these two films essentially have the same plot but the execution of the story of the allegory is done more competently in alita with characters that are more fully formed coupled with superior performances from the actors it a superior movie in every way and recommend seeing this one instead and giving captain marvel miss ', ' just came back from watching the avengers awesome epic cool outstanding fantastic etc looks like for almost the whole year of me waiting to watch movie and all the hype that they built up was worth the wait tom hiddleston as loki is as evil as ever but it would have been great if more villains had shown up along the way jeremy renner as clint barton hawkeye was the surprising character for me since never expected him to turn evil but he was definitely the right man chosen for the role scarlett johansson was beautifully stunning as natasha romanoff black widow thor was great and surprisingly gave the hulk run for his money something which didn quite expect to see speaking of hulk mark ruffalo was well suited to play bruce banner hulk although norton was better in my opinion cobie smulders as maria hills was bit of let down since expected more screen time for her samuel jackson was ok as nick fury robert downey jr is as goofy as ever as tony stark iron man but for me the biggest driving force of the entire movie has got to none other than chris evan awesome acting as steve rogers captain america he was in my opinion the biggest star of the film in my opinion and really made the team come together as one the plot was very simple and straightforward but the action scenes and dram was what made the movie really interesting who says that the movie needs to have good storyline in order for the film to be great the movie itself doesn necessary require story background for the characters at all since they were all already told in their own separate movies respectively on note to those who have been complaining on the film for being mindless boring etc my question is what did you expect from superhero movie this movie is all about action and it was made to be entertaining and fun to watch not for you to sit and expect twisty kind of turn story like tdk the main reason why people go watch is because they wanted to see their favorite main heroes from different franchise team up together in the same movie thats all that is and to me that isn a bad thing at all have degree in film and video majoring animation if you re wondering but still find this movie really good if you guys are looking for something else beyond action in this film then you guys are in the wrong place all in all an epic film which definitely deserves to be ranked in the imdb top 100 movie list and definitely above tdk this is one movie which will surely go and see again on final note kudos to joss whedon and the entire crew for making an awesome superhero film can wait for the avengers 2 ', ' meh good not great absolutely cannot believe no one else is talking about how bad pugh and harbour accents were so nearly ruined it for me johnansson and the action were fine plot was okay ', ' if you like movie with background of fire explotion and someone running in the foreground this movie is full of that scene one after another kind of find this movie okay not great not bad ', ' nothing important nothing interesting only to create cause for something much important for the upcoming movies didn understand why it was so hyped not gonna say it a bad movie but it probably is ', ' its bad nothing more to tell very bad show don want you to waste your time ', ' it is an amazing movie great performances by all the cast really don get the hate it is one of the best origin stories marvel studios has told please stop reading reviews and go experience great film by yourselves ', ' season 1 8 10 season 2 7 10 punisher is solid it probably the second best netflix marvel show behind daredevil the first half of season 1 is okay but it becomes really great in the last few episodes and season 2 has the opposite problem where the first half is excellent but the second half drags although the last few episodes get bit better jon bernthal is perfect as frank castle in fact this entire marvel tv show universe has great casting across the board the action is pretty bad at the beginning of season 1 but gets much better as the series continues it never entirely becomes daredevil levels of awesome but it is really good in its own right but think the biggest thing holding this show back is the fact that the punisher stuff in daredevil season 2 really should have been its own series removing punisher from daredevil season 2 could have fixed lot of the problems with it and made it more focused story there could have been one season of punisher containing the stuff from daredevil including the trial and then season 2 could have been punisher properly avenging his family this is probably the best adaptation of the punisher so far and have no faith that disney will do the character justice so d say give this watch if you re fan of the comics watch it in between daredevil seasons 2 and 3 season 2 of punisher technically takes place after season 3 of daredevil but neither show has any impact on the other and daredevil season 3 works as really great finale for the netflix marvel shows ', ' not marvel nerd but like scarlett johansson sure she ain my favorite actress but liked her in lucy 2014 and spongebob movie 2004 and black widow seems to be the most well known role of hers and spin off movie was inevitable unfortunately it wasn as good as most fans and non fans would expect the plot is very boring and doesn know what exactly to focus on it goes from natasha romanoff leaving the avengers and looking for her family members then it suddenly about some sort of villain that wants to take over the world by hypnotizing women aka other black widows with some special mind control gas must say the orgin story of natasha was actually well done it explains how she became one of the avengers and it happened because of herself being separated from her family not to mention that the soundtrack really sets up the suspenseful and dramatic feeling with the cover of popular rock song by nirvana also the action scenes were not bad at first but it after couple of times you easily get bored of them what makes me upset is that the film has lot of bad dialogue and there was rather disgusting one about removing reproductive organs honestly tried my best to make this sentence less disgusting but it was very pointless and distracting none of the characters are memorable natasha romanoff was just the strong female character that tries to save the world but her performance by johansson wasn too bad and her stunts were done realistically her sister yelena is just generic the only thing that remember about her is that she has her strong russian accent and that it the villain dreykov seems to have potential at being mind controlling villain that is upset about his loved one death but due to it weak execution and bad acting he was just dull the red guardian character is the old type that still wants to be superhero sadly he was forgettable as others even if he tried to be more comical than others he was still bad still this movie had some well done scenes like the car chase honestly m big fan of such scenes since they give an adrenaline rush that will boost up the mood however there were other films that did this stunt better honestly it better to skip this film for non marvel fans not sure about fanboys and fangirls who would binge every single film maybe there a chance that they will enjoy it however it was as bad as maleficent 2 and interview with the vampire it probably has potential and if it was done in the right hands then it would ve been enjoyable sadly it turned out to be very dull and confusing feature ', ' was really looking forward for this so much potential thought after the wonderful marvel movies surely they can go wrong oh my was wrong 45 minutes of the most innate worthless tv have ever seen just could not believe they were making such cheap poor shows anymore bring back the days of the 4400 heroes eureka and alike the latest batch of sci fi shows is terribly poor in conceiving as well as production levels h e d looks cheap and low budget the dialogue is awful but worse of all the casting this must be the worst casting in tv at the moment not even one actor deserve good mention not even the child how bad can it be just watch it and see won last beyond episode 6 ', ' action was awesome but story lacks behind blackwidow story is just ok could be lot better ', ' so finally sat down and watched the first episode with great expectations and was left disappointed it all felt very forced and very much unrelatable after 1 episode it just seemed that it missed the mark of what it could have been great and in comparison to other tv spin offs it was sub par maybe they should consider ending this one after this series ', ' stupidity in virtually every character trish was so annoying was yelling at the tv to please kill her jessica is getting progressively unlikeable overzealous feminism endless babbling really dumb subplots trish please die did like detective costa and karl also the killgrave cameos proved just how amazing that character and david tennant were oh and the last 15 minutes weren bad ', ' was hoping that this film would be just as exciting and involving as the super hero films have seen over the last 12 years men x2 spiderman 1 2 batman begins the dark knight iron man could watch them and really enjoy them time and time again but this one it just didn do it for me m not sure why but even with the 3d effect to be honest didn make much difference until the final battle sequence but even then it was few and far between think this film was too loud and infantile and tried too hard to sound sophisticated and too much technical talk was that supposed to sound impressive there were few funny bits especially with the hulk but on the whole the film just dragged on without real purpose hope the supposed sequel will be much better ', ' was excited to watch this movie based on the teasers and trailers however was extremely disappointed with the weak plot and endless girl drama that was the focus of the story kept giving it chance that it will pick up while was watching but couldn wait any longer after around 90 minutes have passed could ve been way better ', ' before watching captain marvel was expecting boring movie it was huge surprise when walked out of cinema with smile on my face the storyline was simple but that doesn mean boring the movie wasn throwing feminism in your face it was inspiring but not because she was woman but because she a fighter don usually write movie reviews never actually but don think the movie have received enough positive feedback as it should ', ' the show starts slow in season 1 but gradually becomes more and more interesting characters development is really well done of course the storylines in every season are well oiled and if you re big marvel fan the show follows all the big events happening in the movies must watch tv series in my opinion ', ' rating of 8 8 on imdb made me think this movie must be really fantastic but it is not weak plot boring during the first 1 5 hours no introduction to the characters only the end gives bit of what actually expected maybe it is because am not too huge comic fan or that had only seen hulk and thor before which actually really liked it was really disappointing show also the film appeared to be very dark with the 3d glasses on and was not the only one in the audience who had hard time staying awake as other reviewers mentioned as well the different size of hulk in various scenes is bit irritating overall had expected lot more ', ' where do begin ahh yes the beginning movie that never seems to get better as you keep watching it very quickly becomes mcu near carbon copy of every mcu movie made there is nothing that sets it apart imo all the best action scenes are in the front half best light moments are also you guessed it in the front half the acting is very bland no heart as expected in these superhero movies apart from pugh who was very solid all around black widow is very predictable movie that seems like it doesn fit into the larger scale of the mcu it seems it a good way to get scarlett johansson into the mcu for bigger role later on disappointing boring some action scenes are good well done but save you money watch it when it on streaming sites instead of at the movies imo you wouldn remember this movie in few months time if could describe the movie in 1 word bland ', ' the avengers unites iron man downey jr thor hemsworth cap america evans and bruce banner aka hulk ruffalo along with black widow johansson and hawkeye renner to stop loki hiddleston the good effects are good there are couple of actually funny jokes the bad characters are flat and just spend time joking or arguing rather then actually developing action sequences are tedious monotonous and unexciting most jokes are cringe worthy one even made me consider walking out didn but wish had by the end it feels like it didn really do much of anything don understand how the avengers has such high ratings thumbs down ', ' don understand how this movie got 6 9 10 it a very very average movie boring like hell scarlett has like only 2 lines to say and the rest is done by stunt double her sister and father are performing all the action and are really great oscar for them about scarlett she shouldn make claim to get extra cash from disney because she wasn that much in the movie looking at real screen time and she didn perform any stunt it was even at that level it got very annoying her stunt double jumps cut action close up on face of scarlett come on guys really we are in 2021 not 1980 if want this kind of action rather watch movie with steven seagal same style of movies ', ' can say the kids watched it with even liked it was often bored felt the formula was the same as another film found kinda silly but it turns out they copied this one hahaha its forgotten by tomorrow bet this happens now woth tom cruise movies for the same reason the costumes names change the women have different hair or accents but its so forgettable at least it should be fun theyre from comics so get they have formula that works and redo it did prefer the scenes with thor and is now errant half brother otherwise the kids were often bored maybe theres age where this is perfect its probably not mine nor the 10 and 11 yrs olds maybe its because they mostly read classic and new sci fi fiction books this where all the money goes for entertainment rides parks comics cruises streaming content and these films all run by the same top people how can we expect anything artistic in these films still to those who actually made the magical appear on screen salute the cgi animators the costume lol makeup wigs and cool set dec they are the artists bet the storyboards are awesome think those who love superman and spider man will love this its not for everyone ', ' after reading the bad reviews saying this movie is slow all about women bashing men jumps around to much too much cgi ect didn want to waste my time watching it finally watched the movie after getting disney to watch the mandalorian capt marvel was very good haven laughed that hard at marvel movie in long time thought brie larson was good but lacked emotion did like her dry sense of humor think the introduction to nick fury character was good fury and danvers interacted very good together sam jackson makes this movie but that not surprising he makes every movie good the whole cast was good including the cat the plot was good you have to have serious chip on your shoulder not to like this movie if you re not snowflake or drama queen watch this movie ', ' where to start well rated 2 stars because my wife and love cats or else it would be 1 star first start eith story writing it as young kid has been asked story for first time dialogue are simplistic and jokes failes to put smile on your face but most importantly the whole point to the story could easily be prevented one more thing about the story usually we get to know the villain with some background story and how they became to be and the marvels had this to minimum mean for 250 million dollar movie you expect them to have great story when they introduced some new planets and cultures in other movies xandar hala it was well thought got us excited unlike this movie musical planet wow creativity is dead at marvel found acting weirdly bad even from samuel jackson it also felt like brie larson was forced to play this role and she just did it because she has contract special effects are no way near what marvel movies normally have if was either rushed or done cheaply we used to go and watch marvel movies in theatres on first weekend after release because of the tthe circumstances we haven been able to so now we watch on disny plus or amazon whichever comes out first after last few movies ve seen with the exception of the guardians of the galaxy think will not be going to theatres to watch marvel movies until m convinced they are back on track with their movies ', ' black widow does not even spare or even care about other black widows after endgame marvel began to stagnate or even went downhill disney plus shows were mediocre at best and honestly do not know what to expect further most of best actors went away and who can even take their place anyway they should have done this movie in phase 3 because now it is just useless we already know natashas ending so why should we care it is dissapointment and hope that disney will give marvel chance to make better movies because this one looks as cash grab without any deeper meaning behind it ', ' black widow is very pointless film it doesn introduce anything meaningful into the mcu and there nothing inspired about it it just easily digestible content which is forgotten about the moment the credits role the opening is promising but it quickly goes downhill all in all it a pointless film that introduces nothing and doesn challenge anything ', ' haven truly enjoyed lego marvel show for long time star wars always seemed to have edge over them in the lego department that why was skeptical but yhis show didn disappoint instead of focusing on one of the avengers who are frankly boring often they made new one who actually interesting and the avengers and other marvel heros were side show which was super funny the humor never stopped enjoyed the variation of charecters shown as well like daredevil and it was nice seeing him in lego project also moonknight id love to have seen more guardians but they really did stretched out into marvel universe in the one especially with end credit scene definitelydont miss it so funny ', ' should be the other way around because it ends up being quite boring episode rating breakdown 1 little slow but good start cool cgi and very good maybe even the best depiction of current day high school ve seen bit dramatized but that to be expected 2 weird intro mostly cheese and with only the last like 10 minutes being good noticeably different writer 3 dumb rom com chick flick type episode with very dumb villains 4 fell asleep 5 interesting enough 6 super mario great escape ', ' cartoonish characters with no depth and no development too much time spent on trying to have emotional parts which fail miserably the attempt at humor had potential but constantly falls flat constant flaws to take you out of any well wanted emergence like inconsistent russian accents across characters and family members ', ' had very low expectations for this show considering the network the plots and characters it is based on was very worried that the name and characters had grown up loving would be tainted by some cruddy show that someone put together cuz they bored but the pilot surprised me so much think m gonna love this show grew up loving everything about marvel and all its superheros and even side characters and having show featuring only those people on the side and having the pilot blow away marvel fan like me the show has chance but again we will see how far it can vary itself it does have the amazing marvel movies to keep up with ', ' brie larson performance is pretty faultless and her chemistry with samuel jackson is undeniable theirs some real humour and feeling throughout the 90 references are little forced at times but they got plenty of laughs from the audience and most worked well for sheer entertainment value g effects action sequences etc this one is up there amongst the best of the mcu and can only assume that the negative reviews are from people who aren mcu fans are bots misogynistic alt right db or lack any sense of fun ', ' so far the last season has not got waiting for the next episode m more like agets of shield really not suprised it being aired when all other tv shows are on break ', ' yeah this was too much for me the cgi was too much couldn wait for the film to end was even sleepy but had to watch it since was at cinema and had obviously paid it not worth watching honestly you are not missing anything by not watching it ', ' black widow is about 7 8 years overdue as this should ve happened post winter soldier era mcu to me however that doesn diminish this film as solid entry in 25 film saga and certainly one scarlett johansson deserved as proper send off funny action packed when it needs to be and rewatchable black widow made it mark on the genre this summer wish it would ve done better at the box office 8 7 10 ', ' if you re marvel fan and haven watched this show you absolutely need to not only does it have multiple interesting tie ins to the movies the character development and storytelling is fantastic it adds whole new level to the mcu ', ' marvel has had one of the most successful journeys for very long period of time captain marvel was one of the characters which have high expectations from the public she was known to stand against the mad titan and now she doesn seem that strong the casting was good but the movie could have been better we are seeing the same stuff in different faces over and over again this needs to evolve and new story lines must be explored personally think ms marvel is the character that kept the movie together with her fun and excitement otherwise it would have gone even lower yes not every film will be infinity war like but atleast it needs to be little better than what this was ', ' was pleasantly surprised been marvel fan for so long comic book worm and actually enjoyed the vision acting and characters development can they stick bit more to the comics yes can they use little less cgi yes but either way just start enjoying the movies for what they are ', ' good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good ', ' think this is aimed at girls it has all that empowerment sub text and thats okay mean really okay the trouble is the rest of the film has to entertain as well the schmaltzy scenes between the sisters should be great dynamic but it just ended up as empty words empty platitudes and empty scenes film that did get it right was cruella which was low on sentimentality and it had heart dont know about the finer details being left out of the source material story that is black widow all did know was was bored out of my gourd and switched it off after 25 minutes ', ' the good considering that the main character doesn have superpowers there is no option but to focus on good action sequences chases and spectacular rescues in the purest 90s action movie style this works if you are looking for film to leave in the background while you re cooking some delicious bolognese pasta entertaining if you don pay too much attention to the plot and if you manage to avoid sentimentality the bad marvel studios wanted to go out and brag about their ferrari but they didn realize that the gasoline tank was almost empty this story is really like the ferrari it looks pretty on the outside following the tone of the entire mcu but it doesn work because the spark to turn it on isn useful enough if we look at it from the perspective of the entire saga it doesn contribute anything that could not have been justified in brief scene from another future canon film the main character arc is unaffected at all it doesn sort out loose ends from chronologically subsequent movies if there are any and it doesn focus on nat real origin other than couple of conversations they could have included tons of different cameos or introduced iconic characters for the rest of the series but sadly none of that is here and don make up tales saying that valentina allegra de fontaine will be iconic if we see it from the particular perspective as an isolated product it does not work either if it were just another bourne style spy action movie it would have been total flop and the villains they are not convincing at all taskmaster having enormous potential is real waste of character here this movie is skippable even more than the first 2 tv series of the mcu ', ' this is one of the worst marvel movies ever story is awful there are many scenes that just don make any logical sense sadly there are some moments in the movie where acting is not at the level required for mcu movies positive thing is that this movie is relatively short so people don have to suffer for long time in general marvel went from hero to zero after phase 3 and unfortunately there are no signs of recovery it is like marko dinjar directed this movie for those who don know who marko dinjar is he is by far the worst football soccer coach in the history of the game believe me he is really bad just like this movie ', ' waste of time this is commercials not proper episodes stories just highlights from all previous movies ', ' 5 minutes of some scenes of the last movies you find better things on youtube ', ' marvel is known for putting out safe bland formulaic popcorn flicks that kids love and adults can at least enjoy they re never anything special but they re rarely terrible the marvels unfortunately is truly awful don think we can lay much blame at the feet of the director or stars as the problems are so fundamental to the project itself as to probably make good version of this impossible as an example in previous mcu film captain marvel played by brie larson flies through and destroys giant enemy spaceship here for plot reasons she just stands back and watches enemy spaceships that seem smaller by comparison do their thing that gets at the truly fundamental problem with this movie nothing makes sense except as an excuse to have the plot be paint by numbers mcu film there tension between captain marvel and monica rambeau because someone at the studio thought it would make things more interesting but good lord why it about marvel leaving when rambeau was child something like thirty years ago who cares what kind of person holds grudge from when they were twelve there about thousand opportunities and ways they could ve defeated the villain well before the ending why didn they or why didn the creators at least come up with something to better explain their impotence poorly conceived animated sequence that goes on way too long marvel style humor that got old about thirty movies ago people constantly making stupid decisions costumes and sets that look straight out of an 80s movie subplot about the alien cat species that well honestly that part better than everything else so maybe should cut it some slack this film isn the failure of the first mcu black director or an all female lead cast this film is the failure of marvel to do anything other than build itself toward more future projects and ignore any kind of storytelling prowess that the people it hires might have marvel has backed itself into corner of milquetoast nothingness and now it can even manage to do that right ', ' m half way through the second season and thought for sure by now we be done with the whiny billy russo character who is not at all counterpoint to castle every second of him on screen is excruciating and can only think the actor is somehow related to someone in production perhaps its just bad trend of mis casting people in roles that are supposed to be menacing think michael madsen as mr blonde vs lee pace as ronan m also getting tired of repeating the same conversation about moral dilemma over and over often multiple times per episode basically it seems to fill in the time between the action speaking of action its pretty brutal and amazing but often times the fights seem to drag out longer than necessary both for the story or even beyond the expectation of human endurance punisher might be the baddest ass on the planet but he still only has human lungs and don remember ever seeing him doing any cardio in the episodes ve watched also not fan of castle sliding scale of awesomeness depending on whether the plot requires him to get his ass kicked or not john bernthal and amber rose revah are mesmerizing as castle and desani and every second either of them are not on camera is tremendous waste the new season brings alexa davolos as possible love interest and giorgia whigham as the young surrogate daughter amy with both of their talents wasted have no idea what happens to billy russo and ive read grumbling of cancellation so hope the writers get their act together ', ' after waiting so long we got this movie and it doesn disappoint action scenes are very good story is also good and not just action adventure it include emotion natasha re union with her family ', ' this is worth at watch but just once the wouldn watch this again sure they spent lot on effects and grand battle scene at the end but throwing money at movie doesn help weak story this screenplay is weak it is overlong with has some rather strained dialog between the leads the weakest thing about the story is why the evil guy wanted to wreak so much havoc without much reason it just felt bit contrived and isn very involving don feel for any of the characters there is some wit and humor from scarlett deadpan black widow and robert downey rather lame one liners what happened to the charm of the old action hero movies ', ' in order to understand the situation of my review ll clear some things up saw this on regular movie screen no 3d and no imax so maybe wasn fully engrossed in this film due to the medium chose to view it in but lets cut the crap if movie needs images popping at your face every other 30 seconds and imax sized screens to be totally awesome bruh it was never that solid to begin with that being said lets analyze the film shall we so here is the main problems with the avengers as whole it relies too much action with too little meaning what did expect though right well expected something little less cookie cutter than this if transformers is bad movie which it is and far worse than this for lacking fan service of its original audience to connect to the avengers is stunningly mediocre for the exact opposite reason god bless the man or woman that enters the theater with no prior knowledge of every superhero movie released in the last 7 years because all this film contains is fan service upon fan service there is nothing organic about this film and it shows in spades everything and everyone is merely glazed over waiting for there 12 minutes of solo screen time no risks are taking and there is so much star wars prequels equse action going on that it kills any tension you might have the film almost runs 150 minutes 100 of which are unnecessary fights between the bad guys and good guys or the good guys and the other good guys not gelling as team its just an obvious film the avengers isn irredeemable though it has some solid performances particularly colby slomders of how met your mother fame proves she can probably take stab at being an action heroine on her own project and mark ruffalo take on the hulk impressed me the action sequences while over abundant are masterfully crafted and the comedy is surprisingly what works the best in this film with several witty one liners strewn through out the film at the end of the day think the film was too much bang and not enough buck as was leaving gentlemen was talking to his wife and said thought there would be lot less talking my inner monologue rebutted wanna just watch stock footage of things getting blown up and punched but this is what it is if you are fan of superhero movies you ll probably love this if you are fan of things that blow up and implode you ll probably love this too fans of focused films with little more story and character development maybe risk or two being taken will probably feel the same way do about it my one sentence summary of the avengers 2 and half hours of non specific escapism that sounds like something you like which there is no shame in then recommend it if not id pass or wait for rental 5 10 ', ' the marvels is exactly what marvel movie should be it super fun exciting while also having depth and serious moments it stands on it own it perfectly enjoyable without having to see ms marvel or secret invasion but it doesn let the fans down either it has world building character growth and it reflects on questions and problems presented in earlier mcu films making it part of the ongoing narrative adored kamala iman vellani brings contagious positive energy to the movie and you can help but smile was thrilled that her family from ms marvel were featured more prominently than just cameo appearence they re so hilarious and loveable all the main characters bring their game and their funny and heartfelt interactions are worth the price of the movie ticket alone the movie is not only fun but insanely creative as well the cartoon segment in the beginning sold me instantly and there are some really cool montages and shots in this that film students would drool over it also has killer music and lots of adorable cats ', ' well it looks like the negative reviews that started pouring in even before the movie actual release date were of some big dc fans who did not want this movies to succeed at all watched it in imax and was worth every penny spent amazing effects storyline executed well enough and it all creates such an an energy and excitement in the end that you now just can wait to watch avengers endgame would definitely recommend it in big screen and even better if imax option is available ', ' know the reviews say the scenes of partition were unnecessary and long but loved every second of it the art the songs and the vibe of this series was exceptional as is all of marvel work the demographic think that will enjoy the most is the south asian community especially the indians and the pakistanis but think marvel is still predominantly watched by the north american audience and that why the overall rating is low why would you want to watch it 1 great storyline 2 amazing graphics 3 believable characters that are not cliche ms marvel is overall an exceptional series and won my heart ', ' there one major challenge with series like this frank castle has nothing to lose and threats to his own life carry very little weight as marvel anti hero it takes good writing and execution on screen to make you care about the characters and they did succeed the plotting was mostly convincing and tight with one major shortcut that really stuck out in the last third of the series don think the enemy overconfident mistakes at that point were sufficiently earned by the hero deflating some of the suspense the performances were good style cinematography choreography excellent ', ' first muslim pakistani superhero what time to alive to witness this am thrilled with this series showing amazing diversity iman is si natural brilliant actor 10 out of 10 ', ' before the highly anticipated thanos and the infinity stones storyline comes to its long awaited conclusion in next months avengers endgame marvel studios transports us back to the 90 for cosmic origin story centred around larson carol danvers vers k captain marvel amidst an intergalactic feud between the kree noble warrior heroes as described by vers and the skrulls green skinned shape shifting aliens vers is sent hurtling towards earth after barely escaping with her life following botched stealth mission stranded on earth she meets nick fury jackson who is at first reluctant to believe her intergalactic stories when the skrulls arrive on earth shortly after morphing into humans to disguise themselves fury and vers team up to stop the imminent alien threat following their team up vers learns that she may once have had life on earth as air force fighter pilot carol danvers captain marvel garnered quite lot of hype leading up to its release with fans eager to learn how the titular character will eventually integrate with the surviving avengers in endgame unfortunately captain marvel is hardly the game changer it was hyped to be instead it settles as being perfectly fine comic book film and that all there really is to it brie larson is serviceable enough in the title role but her performance isn exactly the most memorable which is surprise given her terrific work in the past just check out 2015 room career best from narrative standpoint the film is little disjointed and doesn always engage as well as it should it takes while for the film to pick up the pace and even when it does it never reaches the wonderous heights of previous mcu films directors such as taika waititi and james gunn brought their own unique styles to their mcu instalments but boden and fleck don establish style here resulting in film with very few memorable moments as for the action sequences they re fine but that it there is nothing in captain marvel that comes close to the brutal fight between captain america and iron man in captain america civil war 2016 or the bombastically mad clash between thor and the hulk in thor ragnarok 2017 sadly the final battle is anticlimactic and not at all exciting and never once felt as though was completely engaged with what was going on having said that there are some noteworthy elements to the film the chemistry between danvers and fury is strong and their buddy cop dynamic that runs through the film is great the friendship between danvers and maria rambeau lashana lynch is well written and the heartfelt stan lee tribute at the very beginning of the film is perfection the digital de ageing of samuel jackson is accomplished brilliantly and the skrulls also looked great but were written differently to their comic book counterparts in saying that in the context of the film felt as though the change worked even if it sacrifices major comic book storyline from being adapted in future mcu instalments captain marvel isn one of the strongest mcu films but overall it a perfectly fine watch it definitely flawed with some storytelling issues that could have been reworked but the dynamic between danvers and fury saves the film from falling completely flat on its face and there are some chuckle worthy moments in there too it a very standard origin story but there is promise for much greater things to come ', ' any marvel movie with nick fury should be slam dunk but brie larson is total miscast you want bad ass female super hero look at gayle gadot she killed it brie should stick to playing slackers because she just doesn have the presence to carry movie like this her false bravado is more arrogance stemming from insecurity than inner strength and confidence plus her acting range is very limited in this role ', ' have yet to see more boring movie in 2021 seriously it full of clich long and tedious dialogues short and inconsequent action scenes just stay away you won miss thing seriously save your time ', ' thought hey why not ve loved every movie in the mcu so far not this time other than david harbours red russian couldn care less about anything else going on at all makes me wish there was better mummy movie in the works for rachel weisz to be in or at least sequel to envy now that was fun flick ', ' really love this show it expands on the mcu depending on how you think of it and providing more story to tell about agent coulson love the character interactions between the main characters giving those family vibes in abc television the special effects are just as advanced as the mcu films the dialogue is so professionally written the actors portrayed their parts so well however no show or entertainment is ever perfect one common theme notice throughout the show is when some innocent characters turn into villains literally every season some character who start out good innocent turns into an antagonist definitely won spoil who but it happens more common than viewers realize also it is television production which is lower than the production of feature length film the production value can be visible when watching it at tv production standpoint and finally the movies affect this show but the show does not affect the movies at all highly recommend this show to anyone who wants to dive deeper into the marvel cinematic universe ', ' after reading many very positive reviews about this movie thought had to watch it after watching most surprising to me was that the movie didn surprise single moment it wasn interesting at all fell asleep at least 3 times while watching it in fact these moments of sleep half sleep are the moments will remember best when thinking back of the avengers like looking at movies lot and can enjoy very different genres and qualities but falling asleep while watching is something usually don or cannot do so this movie especially in its genre must be complete failure what do remember after few days bad guy that really wasn scary some super heroes that had to fight together to stop that bad guy and some more guess some images of them being on space ship and that it that all what about the end m sure was awake at that moment of time but simply can remember it could have only been the heroes winning the battle but how and where think they saved the earth and have been trying hard to do so but at least it happened without any unexpected or original idea so for this movie there is even no chance of writing review that contains spoilers what could possibly be there to spoil that one guy turns big angry and green the avengers is just super flat super clich super boring super hero movie can recommend to watch it ', ' after wandavision tfatws and then poor old loki we miss you loki had feeling this was going to be an average movie they ruined star wars and now they re ruining marvel shame on you disney ', ' the most ridiculous villain ever the dialog when he was on screen was so stupid it was painful it was hard for me to take the rest of it seriously d like rewrite of dreykov please ', ' because is don know anything about the movie industry always wonder how somebody gives the green light to distribute the movies to the big screen was there really nobody who said the movie socks let delay or cancel have no words terrible terrible terrible we had so many good and great movies the guardians infinity saga but the recent stuff is so bad it makes me want to cry we still have hope for reboot of the men and off course the secret war saga marvel really needs to step up and five the audience some quality we are always waiting for such long time after seeing great stuff in the trailers and when the actual movie comes out it terrible ', ' the first half of the pilot was rather rushed and had some very obvious shortcuts in the form of exposition there was little character development instead the characters were introduced as little more than archetypes with distinct function within the plot the second half had some nice action sequences some humour and looks to set up the show as the new warehouse 13 none of that is bad suspect the pace will be calmer more deliberate the exposition disappear the characters will be fleshed out and since warehouse 13 and chuck lost its light heartedness and humour in the later seasons shield may fill an empty space in its place there is potential here if the showrunners keep true to form and aim for that light entertainment action niche hope that is what happens only time will tell 6 10 ', ' this movie sucks marvel ran out of ideas too much talking not enough action the jokes don land and the movie is dry from start to finish don waste your money ', ' season 1 from me gets solid 8 10 maybe even 9 10 season 2 gets 3 10 season one was well written season with thrilling lead character enjoyable side characters esspecially jessica men in the season it was one of the best shows that has been put out by hollywood in long time season two however is extremely predictable so much so it actually ludicrous didn like any of the side characters storylines from season 1 and the sjw metoo propaganda was smelled so much had to take break for few days before continued watched through the entire season and it by far the weakest of the netflix marvel series if they keep this up or make it worse will simply stop watching as ive done with the cw superhero shows wish netflix could be solid business make political comments in the show sure but don sell it so hard don tell us what to think ', ' this movie is better than every captain america movie including civil war florence pugh and david harbor are excellent the fight scenes are exciting and well spread out these low reviews all seem like they re written by martin scorsese this movie made me excited for the rest of this phase ', ' in all fairness scarlett character is one of the weakest of the marvel bunch along with the hawkeye they aren superhero and it shows in this film very weak story fuelled with fight scene after fight scene it felt more like poor james bond movie ray winston cockney russian villain and some terrible scarlett body double shots towards the end were shockingly poor can believe this film has such high rating on here when the first page of reviews does not have score over 5 stan will be turning in his grave if this is the best marvel can come up with now that it owned by disney ', ' it was the pathetic one from marvel except the leading female actor ', ' truly amazing must see from the first episode was hooked must admit that when first saw the trailer was not convinced that this show was going to live up to it expectations but it sure did the acting 10 10 have never heard of charlie cox seen him in anything else before and was blown away by his performance as matt murdock the way the episodes were shot are just right also loved that it was quite dark because daredevil himself is dark character there are few funny moments in the episodes but not to many which suits the show all acting was perfect and cannot wait for season 2 ', ' that was soooo good show is delightful nicely balanced w comedy drama well shot the visuals are really cool likeable cast iman vellani is perfect casting for kamala khan it a good muslim pakistani representation in hollywood ', ' have seen all the dc and marvel series and this one is definitely of the best its like watching aaa marvel movie most of the negative reviews are from indians who is jealous why and how pakistani be superhero just watch and judge this series its superb ', ' loved the first episode story of comic book fan for comic fans don mind the changes to her ability curious for the next episode this isn gonna be for lot of people that fine ', ' really bad writing they didn take advantage of some characters like john amy ', ' boring stuff this series was the last thing mcu needed leading actress was awful there is no story at all might as well watch hannah montana or victorious maybe cast someone who is actually talented next time ', ' was expecting an average movie at best based on many early reviews went and saw it anyway and m so glad did own every mcu film and this one is towards the top in my opinion just don understand what not to like about it will be seeing it again next weekend ', ' the marvels the marvels functioning as the sequel to the 2019 blockbuster captain marvel features the dynamic collaboration of captain marvel ms marvel and monica rambeau collectively known as the marvels as they unite to confront kree leader exploiting resources from other planets while the narrative may seem convoluted the charismatic synergy among the leads adds refreshing dimension despite the antagonist lacking the gravitas to justify the team up observing the marvels navigating through the tumultuous circumstances imparts delightful and lighthearted charm notably the film boasts the distinction of being the mcu briefest cinematic venture runtime that proves advantageous by mitigating the risk of redundancy while the ensemble cast delivers performances that are predominantly perfunctory iman vellani portrayal of ms marvel stands out as luminous highlight in essence the marvels presents tapestry of disorder marked by moments of inconsistency and both positive and negative doses of chaos contributing to an overall experience that while mostly forgettable retains certain appeal 5 10 ', ' very mature and sensitive totally in awe of how they portrayed muslim family so well loving it and can wait for the next episode lots of love to pakistani culture from your indian neighbour ', ' except few characters all others are extremely poor in acting top 3 contenders for worst performance would be ms marvel najma and kamala mom hindi is not urdu the accent used by actors in this not pakistani indian it borderline offensive to make so many mistakes coming to the story it extremely poorly written the action scenes suck only good part is the intro and end 0 character building confusing story which is not explained correctly it good to include all races appropriately but unnecessary inclusion of all races is something disney has been doing recently since this is required for marvel series in general would suggest to skip through and watch as needed the downfall of mcu started with phase 4 ', ' only watched half of this crap taskmaster is barely in the movie and the reveal was very political bland action acting story and just boring this movie is another example of why movies suck now ', ' was waiting for this movie for quite long time so when it got released did not wasted any time and watched first day and first show in 3d can say how much enjoyed there in theater this movie is by far the best action movie in recent times 6 super heroes in one movie what more you can ask from it great story line and to say difficult one why because to capture and present best thing or best part if all super heroes is really superb and character of all superhero did not over shadow of other super hero character and direction is also changeling one when 6 heroes in one movie it is bound to happen but in this movie is does not sleek direction is there when keep story intact and in last 1 hour or 50 min or so it explode in form of best action scene and will take you to the edge of your seat so my rating for this movie is 9 this movie going to break many record at the box office and another summer blockbuster for marvel ', ' love marvel movies and my husband and have seen all of them numerous times this is not strong one feel like it could have been done much better don get me wrong there were definitely good parts to the movie and the main characters for the most part do good job there are characters that they could have included that they did not some of the characters were very weak especially the woman that plays the bad guy some of the costumes and make up are actually poorly done especially the kree characters there are some parts of the character development that are very weak as well without giving spoilers there were also some weird scenes that seem to be disjointed and wts moments it used to be that you could go to marvel movie and be guaranteed ride and pure entertainment now am little hesitant to go but still keep hoping that they will be good movies like black widow shang chi those are amazing movies even the eternals was lot better than this do better marvel ', ' dont understand some of the bad reviews but didn care didnt know this character before cause do not read the comics but really enjoyed it think velani is great actress better than lot of older actors from the mcu and lot of people are always saying this is not like other marvel movies and series so you expect all the same thing there are lot of different characters different ages cultures and so whatever we have to enjoy things for what they are yes this is more teen but why it wouldn be ms marvel is teenager not an adult and she from different culture and brings new kind of powers why she should be the same has other characters and movies thought this was good nice way to present her story nice acting from velani and the other characters good story in general wasn expecting more enjoyed it from what it is teenage girl from another culture that love super hero and becomes one with new kind of magic it gives family moments some teenage drama and love some of the things that are expected from teenager live and more ', ' boring slow way slow the acting isn good the writing isn good watched hoping it would be another netflix winner but it isn but you need ten lines of text even though the show doesn deserve it so here goes the premise could be interesting but it isn as conceived the dark moody film noir approach isn done well and it winds up just being dark as in not enough light maybe the comic book was good but it didn make the transition to the screen krysten isn a great actress and she doesn play the part all that well she basically playing jesse girlfriend without the drugs same mannerisms just didn work for me maybe just maybe we ve played out these comic book based shows ', ' but that really not an accomplishment it a scale which movie has to or needs to pass believe if this movie came out around 2017 well then it have been whole different story better late than never huh ', ' yeah know the title review is high praise but it is true daredevil is made with utter care and love especially the first season outstanding acting from all the main and supporting cast the dark knight and infinity war first part is immortal cause those movies are about battle of ideologies and by god daredevil would let you feel the ideologies of both hero and villian one thing that many superhero movies or series do that they don stress on the artistic part of this genre they think the cool cgi and action is enough but it is not superhero stuffs are derived from comics and comics are form of literature this is where daredevil shines the most by depicting character depth apt dialogues and creating the world perfectly the phenomenal action scenes of daredevil are just bonus daredevil understood the necessity of complex antagonist without deminishing the arc of the protagonist at all guys and gals please watch it this is one of the gem from the golden era of tv series sad that disney cancelled it ', ' it the first time write review and do so just because this series really bothered me am huge fun of the punisher and couldn stand waiting for this series to come out however it would be better if it never came out jon bernthal is an amazing actor and does hell of job playing the punisher but that just about it so much drama so many sidestories so much past related scenarios mean the punisher after avenging his family tragedy he keeps on punishing criminals not here though he just quits life altogether until he finds out that there were some people still alive who had to do with his family death so for about 10 episodes we see frank just doing pretty much nothing forced myself to watch the entire series hoping that something interesting would happen but no pure disappointment so many dramatic sidestories for no reason too much hesitation on pretty much everything mean come on is he the punisher or is he not so blind daredevil do not watch this series it a disrespect to the original punisher only reason for 5 stars is jon bernthal otherwise it would get 0 ', ' was going into it with the mindset of this is another marvel garbage tv show but was sadly wrong it fun and family friendly yes don like they changed her powers but over all the production is good and well it quirky all the actors are perfect as well ', ' the depiction of ms marvel as normal kid who suddenly has superpowers in family that is not accepting of difference is pitch perfect the acting talent is phenomenal and the stories are fun and quirky love it as an adult and think it one of the best teen oriented shows disney has ever produced ', ' think it is the most boring webseries of marvel and the worst of all you people could have displayed it in better way just ruined ms marvel dont understand why marvel is focusing on the charecter religion so much many marvel character are christian there religious aspect is never glorefied at such extent ', ' ve read lot of the reviews and there are mixed reviews m not going to give away and spoilers this time the only thing will say that from start to finish it action packed little comedy will keep your attention loved it ', ' iman vellani was wonderful as the titular ms marvel very fun character with different background than most mcu superheroes we ve seen so far enjoyed how her ethnicity truly played into the story and wasn just tick on the diversity checkbox and her struggle between her religious family and her more secular american lifestyle superhoism was interesting to watch but sadly that pretty much it everything else was pretty bland the story developed way too slowly the villains were bland and boring and honestly pretty dumb the big character moments felt rushed and unearned and honestly had really hard time keeping my attention on the show for quite lot of scenes it a shame because there was so much potential there but it really didn go anywhere still just because kamala is such fun character ll give it 7 and say it worth watch but don expect much ', ' all things considered this movie is decent it a bit darker grittier for marvel movie however it still doesn do much exploring into natashas past there a lot that skipped over which is disappointing however the biggest disappointment of the movie is taskmaster it iron man 3 bad what wasted opportunity to bring in the actual character they could have introduced new character or used an actual female villain instead of what they did here ', ' story it was pointless that all have for you production nearly messed it because this one shot was pointless to watch waste of time plus no one asked for an agent carter tv show she was superficial character she didn like rogers until he was injected with the serum highlight when it was over and forgotten until now main intelligence stooges can be intelligent should you watch this clip no it beyond pointless don worry about it at all ', ' some good action some good humour plus some not so great action and more than few jokes that fell flat ray winstone was meant to be stand in for harvey weinstein right funny how the protagonist and antagonist are played by actors who have both been main characters in jonathan glazer films ', ' nice movie but didn reach my expectations you must watch if you are marvel fan ', ' went to see the avengers in movie theater in paris it actually seemed kind of strange that it premiered there week before it did in the united states nevertheless wanted to watch it in order to prove to myself that some marvel universe productions based on comic books can be outstanding unfortunately as left my seat thought that like all the previous one superhero shows it disappointed me entirely why should you ask basically the plot is childish but wouldn expect more from big budget blockbuster made only to pleasure the masses as of now it can somehow achieve the greatest opening ever wow it already made fortune from the great marketing campaign that started weeks before the opening day that truly brilliant considering what is being advertised throughout the world as one of the best movies in years must admit it is strangely awesome that they were able to assemble such cast of stars and pack them into one two hour film the names speak for themselves but what can be achieved with so many highly paid actors when the whole idea behind the picture seems dull love to see all of the well known faces shown on the screen together at one particular moment but when the scene isn entertaining the point is really becoming unimportant the dialogues are cheap they do not show any insight into the characters positions in the circle of the avengers of course in order to fully understand who is who and the relations between the heroes it is mandatory to watch all of the movies that show the origins of every single person now want to point point some out few aspects that make the movie little more enjoyable there were few nicely implied gags that made me laugh most of them were connected with hulk turbulent nature and that is always good thing to make fun of also the many sarcastic but highly intelligent remarks made by tony stark made me believe that iron man must certainly be the most amazing guy in the entourage additionally would like to note that you don have to watch the movie in 3d in order to get the best experience the enormous potential of this technology isn actually given all of the epic major explosions blasts rampages and spectacular fights are providing great special effects in themselves this is the part that is probably the most pleasurable when the avengers team do not speak to each other but just fight their way through evil forces in order to stop loki thor brother action sequences are decent and the camera motions that shifts between all of the battling heroes deserve recognition all in all have to say that would much rather read the comic book while riding subway to work than waste my time seating in the cramped cinema on thursday evening now just have to hope that all the other 2012 epic superhero productions will be better because even after this slight disappointment still believe that this year will provide the greatest entertainment in this genre that the world has ever seen ', ' gave it watch and everything was poorly done say tv quality guess if you re looking for inclusivity for the sake of being inclusive it might have redeemable qualities but if you are movie buff like me and appreciate good story over garbage fire don waste your time found it to be lacking anything that d consider entertainment ', ' watched this without knowing anything about it at all some people argued some people shouted back at them then some other people chased some other people then they all had fight then had to make some decisions then load of monsters and superheroes turned up then all of the same things happened again but with the superheroes involved this time and with explosions too and more fighting it seemed to be over something important then one of the teams won which seemed to be the right result looking at the people was watching it with had feeling had seen this or similar story in something once when was kid but everyone else who watched it with me seemed to be interested so should keep the kids amused for while ', ' except for few special effects it didn have any special point it contained weak script and dozens of outtakes it was 2 hours wasted the worst of the marvel movies ', ' this isn the mcu it a kids show gave it two episodes but that it m sure tweens will love it but anyone born before the millennium will just roll their eyes constantly ', ' had my doubts and reservations about this movie saw this last week and all have been squashed like bug puny god from character depth to just the right amount of near non stop action this movie delivers everything there is very good reason why it is the highest grossing opening weekend movie in human history think everything that can be said about this movie is said in the countless other fantastic reviews made by people with far more creative use of the english language than could muster the villain was the second best have ever seen only to the joker by the late heath ledger am simple guy so will just end with this go watch the movie ', ' there was not much expectation knowing scarlet johansson was in the main role but even with no expectations this is just one of the worst marvel movies besides black panther lame jokes boring dialogues stupid fighting scenes no tension at all another 2 hours of my life wasted thanks walt disney ', ' really don get it ms marvel had an interesting background story and narrative but her origin story got scrapped and turned into this trash it really too bad they couldn introduce her to the mcu how she has been represented as up until this point why even bother saying it an adaptation she may as well be an entirely different superhero now who knows why exactly disney made this change is it so her polymorph ability isn ripped off mr fantastic too complicated to have series with special effects or what about instead of having coming of age understanding her inhuman powers let nerf her to the ground so she can be captain marvel sidekick it truly shame disney rushed out this garbage basically stripped her of her powers to make her glorified disney princess ', ' gee they can seem to follow the comic book its so straight forward there is no villain cameo and worthy plot direction mostly filler episodes season one was great but this was broken very un marvel who ever directed these episodes stick to the comic instead of creating non sense alisa jones is different story though she still doesn resemble the alisa of the show at all her relationship with jessica isn ideal regardless of the context with the wrap reporting that things are strained between jessica and alisa in the comics as well ', ' it pity to realize this is more lame than the falcon and the winter soldier and they are at least think way cheaper to make how does someone escape from government in an old cessna and how does someone disappear from the radar by having floating fortress in the sky never heard of satellite surveillance in marvel universe that share space with ironman stark industries iron fist rand enterprises various government including wakanda shield and sword and how would it hover by these lame propellers that supermom finishes with one hit from gun how would they bring fuel for this undetected wouldn be more stealth way be hidden in an ocean or something apart from the premise lame plot devices gubers that are not explained giving hundreds of millions of dollars to clearly incompetent no name director just because she is wahmen also giving screenwriting to other wahmen of similar experience that don bother not with reading comics but perhaps even former movies that featured main antagonist for nothing more than bland action flick like charlies angels only male characters are 3 incopetent fake father despite being actual supersoldier he just joke relief sleepy arms dealer and generic bad ruskie villain this is new low for marvel and it sad since black widow used to be interesting character whole marvel phase is wearing off maybe some tv show keeps them afloat but movies like this don think so ', ' agents of shield is one of the best marvel television series and is on par with netflix daredevil even though it is network television show after the first half of season 1 it really gets going and becomes one of the best marvel released media the team dynamic is one of its strong suits with all characters having satisfying arcs the villains are some of the best and very memorable but not only the that the action rivals that of netflix shows and is very entertaining the stories are well written and compelling and if you can make it past the worst part of the series the first few episodes which lay the groundwork you will be rewarded with one of the best things marvel has to offer ', ' the plot was very slow boring and uninteresting for me the action scenes were nothing special and the main villain is generic bad guy who could be defeated by anyone in the mcu with very little effort in other words felt this movie was unnecessary especially after the events in endgame would highly recommend skipping this one you are not missing out on anything in this movie ', ' feel like have to review this show it for so many to enjoy even for those who aren that into superheroes the characters are very likable and interesting even the villains the action is directed and choreographed fantastic with lots of cool sequences and violent grit and the stakes feel real each episode ends with great cliffhangers that keep you wanting more each and every time there are some scenes with lot of legal jargon and technicalities that ruin it ever so slightly but generally it is easy to follow charlie cox is great at playing blind man you re so convinced throughout the show that he really can see also found that it was neat choice to hold off on giving him his suit until the very end of the first season with less cool but still acceptable suit used for many episodes that really worked this is one of the best shows that have seen in quite some time and want to go back in time and slap myself in 2015 to 2018 for not checking it out sooner as it came out ', ' anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was nightmare and it shows in the final product here it like they couldn figure out what direction to go so they made 4 versions and blended them together which would explain the high budget the 5 delays and the reshoots kamala character was probably the best part of the movie promise you the script did her no favors but she stood out her acting was in line with her character this was probably an exciting opportunity for her and she wasn going to let bad script and production problems stop her from giving great effort however the story the dialogue the musical gimmick the weak villain it just didn work don think the blame lies solely with the actors or even the director who did lack the experience for helming movie with budget this size think disney interfered heavily with the production which almost always yields bad results think it was doomed to fail they put so much pressure on this being successful they forgot to make it coherent unique or interesting ', ' by the end of season 2 just wanted every character on this show to die hated them all with passion horrible story terrible acting and maybe one of the most annoying wastes of time ve ever experienced at some just kept watching just to see how bad it would continue to get and wasn disappointed except not everyone dies at the end which is too bad ', ' the marvels disappoints on multiple fronts primarily with poorly written characters that lack the depth and charisma expected from superhero ensemble the protagonists arcs feel rushed and superficial leaving viewers disconnected from their struggles and triumphs character development takes backseat resulting in lack of emotional investment in their fates the film villain is glaring weak point characterized by generic and uninspired design the lack of compelling antagonist diminishes the stakes as the conflict lacks the intensity needed to engage the audience the narrative falters further due to an overreliance on tired tropes making the antagonist motives and actions predictable and uninspiring the storytelling itself is chaotic mess with disjointed plotlines that struggle to coalesce into cohesive whole subplots are introduced haphazardly creating jumbled narrative that feels more like checklist of superhero clich than thoughtfully crafted story pacing issues exacerbate these problems leaving viewers bewildered by the abrupt shifts in tone and pacing despite the film potential to explore complex themes it opts for superficial storytelling that fails to resonate on deeper level the lack of nuance in character interactions and the oversimplification of moral dilemmas result in narrative that feels juvenile and lacking in substance in conclusion the marvels falls short of expectations plagued by poorly written characters an uninspiring villain and narrative that struggles to find coherence it a disheartening installment that fails to capture the essence of what makes superhero stories compelling and memorable ', ' is this by freaking chance or anyone could see this army look them at face looks exactly as the host of city of the dead in darksiders 2 flying serpents looks like leviatans at darksiders 2 nah don believe in coincidences movie have so much effects and so less real moments fight between thor and loki or between natasha and arrow guy that was real choosing to bring alien army on earth was pretty bad idea and nothing fits like atmosphere action and stuff less ninja clown performances and shiny effects more good actor playing please btw do you had to ruin the end battle showing that barton guy hairy armpits few times at every scene who ever considered that attractive he is fat looks like drugged and hell not nice to look at ', ' captain marvel is superhero film and is also the twenty first film in the mcu marvel cinematic universe franchise captain marvel stars brie larson samuel jackson jude law and ben mendelsohn captain marvel revolves around kree warrior named carol danvers who has recurring memories of her past while at the same time getting caught in the middle of war between the kree and the skrulls now think m going to start this review by addressing the elephant in the room and that is brie larson brie larson came under fire for making racist remark about how this movie was made to target female audiences and not white male audiences may be paraphrasing that but you could look up articles and watch videos about that because don want to get into all the details and after that remark all the internet trolls were mad and some of them have this fantasy that brie larson took the role of captain marvel because she a strong female superhero who is the only superhero that could destroy thanos they also said that brie larson was miscast because she only had one emotion and that we were supposed to look up to her as symbol and my response to all this statement is is that its no the best but it could ve been lot worse know nothing about captain marvel nor do intend to go out and immediately buy captain marvel comic book not once during the whole movie did feel that brie larson ruined captain marvel for me or that she seemed uninterested in taking the role she portrayed the character really well and maybe it was do to the fact that there were so many backlash against her being captain marvel that she was able to tap into that character the movie offers great special effects characters and an emotional ride where almost actually cried and also die hard marvel fans are still going to see this film because they don care about all that information just mentioned and its still going to make trillions of dollars whether it sucks or not so overall while captain marvel may not be the best superhero movie out there its definitely not the worse we ve seen that it worth the price of ticket whether you re comic book fan or not ', ' jessica jones suffers from the netfix monotone syndrome in that most of netfix series have the same overall tone as breaking bad and better call saul it works for those series and some series but netfix is doing all their series this way and it makes lot of them extremely boring jessica jones is one such series ', ' this tv show is everything you ever want in an action show it has the action it has the storyline and it has great cast to boot when you start watching you just cant stop its easy to watch the whole 2 seasons back to back and when finished it leaves you wanting season 3 recommend as must watch its the best marvel show by far ', ' this was decent entry in the marvel comics universe movies as brie larson reprises her role as captain marvel she gets her powers entangled with other characters powers and they have to work together to save the universe the movie relies more heavily on that action sequences and special effects than great story but thought the movie was ok liked the cat scenes and samuel jackson bringing in his character of nick fury it wasn too bad way to spend your time and you might be glad you saw it larson was good as captain marvel and the special effects were first rate 1 2 out of ', ' idol season important to me and will be in the group with the best of luck in your opinion on the show and tell me what u you coming back from you soon in the new year to you to go to new year with bunch and will be fit for the ', ' they wrote this for me 40 something female nerd with love of subtle nin tshirts the evita soundtrack kittens singing sisterhood and space aliens not sure what the hate is for this movie tonally it was in step with the guardians movies in terms of how it meshed humour and action and it wasn an excitable unsubstantiated mess like thor love and thunder before it my only criticism is still don care much for the kree or scrolls as side races they are bit meh nick fury and ms marvels family are supporting stand outs nod to how fantastic captain marvels dress was in that scene add another princess to your list disney ', ' very nice graphics and motions to 2012 didn expect this at all mcu series is masterpiece phase 1 done m watching every single movie to be ready to watch spider man no way home ', ' unfortunately this show is very derivative and complete waste of time it has it funny moments but they are far outnumbered by the amount of times me and my kid just cringed the actors are doing their best with horrendous script so don blame them at all judging by the comics sales of ms marvel cannot fathom why they thought tv show surrounding this character would be hit the only way they ll get people to watch this is if the show has weak connections to other better movies and characters with an occasional easter egg cameo or end credits scene which if there are any will be watching 30 second clips on youtube not the show if you re soy sucking tween or the unfortunate parent of one you might want to or have to watch it ', ' m always so thrilled to see marvel movies and almost always have great time even if the movie isn great and with three women superheroes sign me up unfortunately my expectations were too high and was extremely disappointed the plot was so mangled and the lack of energy they put into the story bugged me ve seen all the movies and tv shows up until now and was still very very confused didn feel like marvel movie more like disney channel original movie one would ve enjoyed but not sat in the theater for it hard to believe this is in the same world as the black panther civil war or even the first captain marvel movie in the end iman vellani was absolutely joy to watch loved the action scenes and the switching but the movie fell flat even the heartfelt parts didn totally add up or connect in meaningful way want to say it was fun but was too confused to sit back and enjoy the movie ve been trying to defend marvel for while since everyone had fatigue but now that fatigue has hit me m tired ', ' went in with very low expectations but haven seen any movies in couple of months and this was about my only option in some time had mixed feelings about captain marvel but this movie was completely silly disney seems to be mixing up it children programming with it marvel universe which is not good the actors are not convincing brie is attractive but carol danvers isn an endearing character didn connect with any character in the movie couple of scenes were obviously supposed to be funny but this is marvel movie not mel brooks it didn feel that way the whole time but the song and dance scene and the cat scene remove you from any seriousness the film may have had it felt like film written for twelves year olds by twelves year olds in my opinion the acting was bad even fury seemed little forced or rushed or off something just was miss the story was probably better than captain marvel but everything else made it worse movie know you can replace brie at this point but surely for 300 million you can find better people to surround her ', ' the punisher more like the whiney neanderthal whoever wrote this series is joke completely butchered the character and the storyline the acting is absolutely atrocious and the editing is just as bad the only punishing that goes down is the pain you suffer watching this trash m huge punisher fan love the comics and the movies warzone was the best this is just boring slow moving trash with terrible acting even worse scripts and lack of any redeeming qualities forced myself to sit through 10 episodes waiting for it to get good or at the very least not terrible but it only got worse pathetic don watch this if you like the punisher actually don watch this at all no matter what you like it insultingly bad ', ' no one needs to wax lyrical about why this show deserves nothing but an avalanche of abuse rained down on it just watch it and you ll have all of your worst fears confirmed cancel it now no one needs to wax lyrical about why this show deserves nothing but an avalanche of abuse rained down on it just watch it and you ll have all of your worst fears confirmed cancel it now no one needs to wax lyrical about why this show deserves nothing but an avalanche of abuse rained down on it just watch it and you ll have all of your worst fears confirmed cancel it now ', ' this was so dumb they make an all male movie they complain but watch it and it entertaining they make an all female movie and it unwatchable but want to make small group happy kamala crying and screaming was unbearable the story was mess and unoriginal they forced an unwanted antagonist that brought very little to the movie even the special effects were not up to the usual standards they started amazing then just in like some recent movies there were scenes that were just bad there were so many great stories that they could have gone with but they just thought that we would watch what they throw at us but those days are about to end if they don get back to what got them here stop trying to make everyone comfortable and just make good movies ', ' it was funny well written and spoke to the younger generation so many head nods and yes it beneficial to watch the series you don have to it is explained am looking forward to what is next for the marvels and so excited to see what happens after those end credits wish people would rate things without bias but female lead movies always have the harshest reviews really hope we see more of all the marvels in the future also hope they make another ms marvel tv show as loved the first season recommend watching without bias and enjoy the fun and embrace the mcu universe ', ' my sister and bro in law recently turned me onto this netflix original it been awhile since saw the 2003 ben affleck film so it hard for me to compare the series with that film but overall think like this even better at the moment m on like episode 8 or so blind attorney matt murdock charlie cox works in the legal profession by day but at night he becomes vigilante on the streets which are controlled by rising mastermind crime lord wilson fisk played by vincent onofrio in one of the best performances of his career d say read at wikipedia that the creators of this show see this series as crime show first super hero show second that more the way it plays and must say the fight action sequences in this are some of the best ve ever seen on network television also like rosario dawson budding amalgam of temple night nurse adds nice touch to the series elden henson deborah ann woll vondie curtis hall ayelet zurer and bob gunton also round out fine cast read that this show as part of the marvel cinematic universe will eventually lead into mini series for the defenders which will also include the characters luke cage iron fist and jessica jones will be interesting to see how all this comes together ', ' my wife wanted to see this movie and honestly wasn very excited we re both huge marvel fans but m just not big captain marvel fan so wasn expecting much but honestly really liked it it was charming clever really funny and the story was refreshingly simple unlike some other marvel movies where the heroes are always trying to save the whole entire universe the story was little more compact it definitely has that girl power vibe which didn feel out of place it felt very natural and not forced was very entertained throughout the entire film and didn get bored at all and the stinger at the end had me very excited ', ' fine that the series is aimed at kids as it is pretty cringe worthy in places however lately they never seem to slip in some cultural issues trying to educate us on race and religion it programs like this that keep emphasising race colour and religion that are making the division greater drop all the woke bs and racial finger pointing and maybe people will just treat people for who they are ', ' while enjoyed my time with the film can say was thoroughly impressed my expectations where that of family dynamic winter soldier instead the film doesn lean hard enough on the espionage and consequences of natasha past while the action can at times be well choreographed the set pieces and moment to moment storytelling felt generic found myself predicting events before they unfolded it could be because ve seen many films or it could be because the scripts predictable however enjoyed the family dynamic the most that where the film shines also have to commend harbour and pugh their performances stood out to me ', ' went into black widow with petty high expectations due to the fact that we ve had to wait for it fir over year because of covid it made expecations even higher not all of the films in the mcu are masterpieces but most of them are entertaining and somewhat memorable black widow for me has been one of the best characters in the marvel universe and don understand why she never got her own stand alone film until after we know her fate in avengers endgame but we finally get this film and unfortunately it is one of the weakest mcu films since it started in 2008 with iron man scarlett johanssen is credited as an executive producer on the film so think she had some say in the direction the film but she should have gotten better script the film is set in after the events of captain america civil war natasha romanoff is on tge run because the avengers are all being hunted we get some backstort with natasha as kid with her sister yekelana and her supposed parents melina and alexei the movie is not really an origin story but it deals with some of the things that formed natasha into the woman she is the film feels very jokey and lazy at the same time there is good chemistry between scarlet johanssen and florence pugh who plays yelena pugh gives the best performance in the film she is very funny and fleshes out her character well rachel weisz is and david harbour are good in their roles but are really just comic relief the action is not particularly exciting nothing we ve never seen before the main villain dreykov is also very weak as fantastical as these types of films are they work when they involve us is what happening we get invested in the story it did not feel invested the action is over the top as expected but is really just average there is no sense of danger the cgi dominates so much that it just isn exciting it disappointing that such great marvel character would get such an average and uninspired film one of the worst in the series grade ', ' maybe the show should be canceled noticed the reviews on this page calls him super hero but every fight he has he gets his ass beat and hurt lol some super hero ', ' garbage story the stupidest re write of the black widow origin imaginable ', ' this show is so boring and slow at times charlie cox is great vincent don know how to spell it too it shot well but overall don like it at all really some cool fights but it like 1 good fit for every 4 hours of boring crap suffered through season 1 just cus wanted to see the suit not worth it season 2 sucked and really struggled to finish it gave up after that saw bits and pieces of season 3 on youtube this series is vastly over rated and boring but to be honest all superhero tv shows usually suck think my biggest thing is everyone is so unlikable elektra sucks punisher sucks preferred thomas jane foggy is whiney and annoying karen sucks stick is jerk to be fair it not the actors it the characters don care about any of them ', ' fantastic series with great acting best superhero series ever vfx is nice villain is very tough and chemistry between matt muddock and foggy is fantastic ', ' worst acting hv ever seen in any marvel content not even one time watch concept of djinn is nice but they should have gone for better actors actresses ', ' really enjoy some comic book movies spiderman 2 and the first men are excellent in my opinion but m completely baffled by the high ratings given the avengers the dialog is stupid most of the costumes really lame the story line completely predictable and good lord but the clich run rampant the super villain has british accent that about all you need to know about this movie most of the acting was completely forgettable or in the case of samuel jackson just plain god awful if it weren for robert downey and mark ruffalo don know how could give this more than one star as was suffering through this awful thing my mind kept drifting to mystery men and how much better and funnier it is ', ' watched this movie till the end hoping it gets better but sadly it didn the movie feels forced rushed with no natural flow like the other mcu installments it as if the actors were given check list to complete before the time runs out the movie feels flat and unexiting some music cues just didn fit just couldn see the synargy between the main character there was no chemistry like with the avengers or guardians brie as always does gr8 job but feels as if her character and presence was diluted to share the spotlight it seems the director tried to make it funny but missed the mark they should perhaps take page from james gunn guardian recipy was really disappointed and won add this movie to my mcu blu ray collection the movie feels lacking and more cg was added to fill the voids sory but this movie really felt more like fan based non cannon production than something that you would expect from marvel studious crossroads easter egg advert than something mcu cannon ', ' loved the first season it wasn political had an amazing plot with an outstanding villain role but then the second season came around and got all feminist like and that was really dumb it made it seem more like rant than show at one point the lesbian female lawyer calls god she and that kind of annoying just don mention god at all if you don believe in him then they kept bringing up how women are apparently brought down by men all the time and stuff and that clearly bs they hit homer run with the first one so just learn from that and succeed more ', ' slow boring and stupid not much more to add here the family conversations feel so inorganic and the dialogues in hindi urdu aren even pronounced right at times it simply just bad acting it feels like am watching show on nickelodeon ', ' it definitely directed towards children but that didn mean that marvel had to drop its standard people in the comments complain that we hate it because it too childish but honestly simply have problem with the standard the script and storyline is so mediocre and unexciting marvel movies and shows used to have me staring at the screen eyes wide open hand clasping my mouth but now couldn even bring myself to go past episode 4 and when was watching episodes 1 4 it took everything in me to want to pay attention and not fall asleep in my opinion this is marvel worst and has caused me to not like ms marvel character at all ', ' suggest you to not waste your time on this show totally tatti show too childish story worst television show evwr produced instead suggest you to see some anime like samurai champloo or great teacher onizuka ', ' amazing if you haven seen it yet don know what you re waiting for no chapter falls below eight points season 1 is good season 2 is leveling up and season 3 is the best never saw season as good as 3 tension in each episode incredible the best marvel series without doubt hope disney since he has his rights now doesn screw it up as he a great character and they can get lot out of him in future marvel movies ', ' the storyline could have actually done so well if the animation was in the same style as the other previous avenger cartoons making it an anime was by far the dumbest mistake marvel has ever done the cringe dialogue the silly over the top anime music graphics in the background and announcements of powers and characters really annoyed me the voice acting mainly the kids were just too cringe and couldn even finish the first episode it was like watching random japanese show based on superheroes not an avengers show with the animation slightly tweaked not enjoyable in the slightest ', ' taking place after captain america civil war this film sees natasha scarlett johansson meeting up with her old comrades from russia in order to bring down red room the secretive black ops program that made her who she is first of all we should have had this movie years ago preferably right after civil war and definitely before infinity war the fact that we only got it now is whole bag of issues putting that aside liked the film lot johansson is still amazing as natasha although do have to admit that some of the side characters ended up stealing this film from her florence pugh as yelena another black widow was riot and hoot m definitely hoping that we will see more of her in the mcu david harbour as red guardian captain america russian counterpart was also great character and d like to know more about his past and his fixation on steve aside from that the movie contained the usual amount of marvel goodness great action scenes top of the line visual effects clever quips one mindblowing end battle you know the usual what we ve come to expect from marvel in the best possible way is it the best marvel film ever made no should it have been made before endgame yes was it still worth the wait very much so ', ' reviews not appearing m only assuming it because it a female led movie and they re not allowing bad reviews for that sole reason pathetic ', ' everything is so predictable poor victim gets mistreated then hero steps in gets kicked around but in the end he prevails hero limps off badly wounded after five minutes he better than before and ready for the next poor victim getting mistreated ', ' this is spectacular series for all viewers to watch the crew did fabulous job in creating this series the storyline of this series was full on great and unique the cast selection was extraordinary they completely committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters the chemistry between the cast members was fine and strong for this series this series reveals to viewers that everyone is fine the way they are and it also shows equality am someone with disabilities and severe health conditions during my lifetime have been alone bullied depressed and hated for being myself this is great series for everyone to watch ', ' horribly juvenile writing and the worst displays of superpowers it just cringeworthy and doesn do the comics justice the constant added animations are way too much too it just unwatchable ', ' black widow has everything d want from the genre m shocked that it getting so much hate and star struck that so many times people in the audience went in and out during pivotal scenes absolutely love the cast they re extraordinary and great actors throughout it was such blessing to see marvel film in the theater especially in imax plus since covid they delayed the release million times better than watching at home on disney plus hilarious thought had was taskmaster riding up in 64 lol hope my thoughts get seen by many cause the movie is quite enjoyable for what it is ', ' can stand the current woke religion of today and half expected it from this mainly due to the reviews but found myself enjoying this it light fun entertainment childish and carefree also comedic just because it franchises on another culture other than the cheap plastic americana we get feed like an 50 off all you can eat bullh hit buffet doesn mean it woke liked the characters slightly clich but also charming the lead is funny charming and cute the story is imaginative colourful and fun enjoyed this wayyyy more than obi wan deserves more credit ', ' it up to you to believe me but this show is just pure drivel the story line is just unfathomable and the central character lacks any semblance of personality got to episode 8 hoping it would improve but gave up 40 minutes in of talk talk talk talk and more talk it is quite frankly boring and lacking in action and good acting just watch episode 8 and you ll see what mean cannot think of more boring episode of tv in my whole life if this show makes it to season two will be amazed in fact it will be marvel the script writers need sacking dull dull dull it ain no walking dead ', ' as usual for hollywood movie of this scale was hyped received good reviews but had doubt if the movie could deliver what it promised pure fun and it sure as hell delivered excitement thrill action and everything you want from superhero movie with joss whedon touch the way the characters interact from the beginning to the end is fun rdj always at you with witty one liners chris evans maintains the character he built in captain america chris hemsworth well he continues the story arc from thor of brother vs brother mark ruffalo what an amazing addition to the cast the hulk really stands out in the movie loki pure menace hawkeye perfectly cast black widow looks do kill ', ' cage character is one major problem also terrible actor jessica kind of sucks out loud too yet another show about woman being an independent tough hero her romance scenes are turn your head away gross what percentage of movie and tv follows this same format of the female lead independent tough hero boring lame unoriginal ya tenant always great but lost in crappy story and weak character nothing new nothing interesting awful waste of time ', ' okay so without doubt this is the best thing made by marvel far better than all their movies far better than every other superhero action show out there and no m not over exaggerating this is coming from someone who has watched 100 of shows across dozen languages charlie cox absolutely nails his character we think that superhero movies shows doesn have much space for deep character acting but that exactly why this is amazing the acting is absolutely brilliant there a mysterious dark eerie tone to the show which makes it stand out than everything else the script is tight and story develops at very decent pace biggest flaw marvel cancelled the best they ever created ', ' am still amazed by this movie first was bit skeptic since lot of movies with big names are not that good as you may suggest but this original jokes even when you don suspect it laugh so hard was crying and is not so called funny movie like american pie the type of the characters are clearly distinguishable and is the same as in the previous movies but even if you didn saw them you can fully enjoy it but if you did it adds something extra it full of action and even when it is not so much going on the screen you never feel like that something is missing or boring it is the perfect movie to switch off laugh hard and enjoy what happening on the screen ', ' episode 1 when saw the trailer thought it looked pretty stupid and the plot seemed cringeworthy but decided to watch it anyway while it still does have corny dialogue factor of it being disney show it is still very well made show was surprised to find out that iman vellani the main character has never acted in any film or show ever she did an amazing job at portraying teenager task that only few can do am not from pakistani family but from what ve heard and known about pakistani families it seems very accurate and it works well the music is not just good it outstanding laura karpman does fantastic job the cinematography and camera work is very good too as is the visual effects the plot of the story is little cringey but it kinda makes sense for it to be cringey because the whole story is about fan girl that is obsessed with captain marvel thought the pace was also perfect for tv show too plot 7 10 casting 8 10 acting 8 10 cinematography 9 10 dialogue 8 10 creativity originality 10 10 setting 9 10 music 10 10 visual effects 9 10 pace 10 10 characters 8 10 we don meet many characters yet memorable 7 10 entertainment value 9 10 overall 8 10 ', ' the enforced narrative lacked substance in reality there was no story to speak of if given the option would have preferred to stick with the movie trailer and considered it the entire experience because the actual film was disappointingly awful why was it so poorly crafted the storyline was unimaginative dull and outright stupid the standout in the movie was iman vellani she infused the film with sense of fun and provided some level of entertainment as for teyonah parris her character abruptly entered the story out of nowhere gaining superpowers without any meaningful explanation or training the introduction of her character seemed utterly pointless throughout the movie brie larson appeared visibly uncomfortable with her surroundings and the overall situation to cut to the chase the story was lacking with few enjoyable moments however it ultimately presented weak representation of the marvel universe ', ' skip it it a lot different compared to the compelling thrill ride funny and coherent stories marvel are it less funny less thrilling then most of them the fight scenes were fun though and the acting was fine it decent m marvel fan but think this is average your son and dad ladies will be disappointed overall 5 10 ', ' this is the reason love imdb by and large the reviewers have nailed it the weak link in this series was the writing am not sure how the writers room worked in this series but if there was lead guy who laid out the overall story and then left it to bunch of junior guys as his support team to fill in the details the support team went belly up in the second season it sounded like it was written by bunch of 10th grade remedial boys in private school feel bad for the actors that actually had to say such banal stuff ', ' this show is so good it funny it has character and it unique story is just amazing this show is the best in while and highly recommend the first 2 episodes really bring you into the story and intrigue you with it great plot and character development ', ' been watching all marvel movie and series but this one dissapoint me from the storyline and character development oh yes m from indonesia google it ', ' definitely m going with 1 10 here thought this movie might surprise me but it actually surprised be my being the worst bad characterisation of almost all characters the third act is pure cgi mess the worst thing is the wasted potential of taskmaster and red guarding as some stupid mind less goof really really disappointed ', ' strangely the best thing in this movie was kamala khan character first introduced in pretty terrible show nobody watched every single other thing in this movie was terrible captain marvel was someone nobody wanted to see on screen again and bree larson remains unable to act she tries on her acting and drama and humour pants and found they didn fit so she just fumbles around and does poor job rambo was introduced as an apologist for slavery and torture got some kind of turning intangible thing going on which she got by walking for some reason in d show so she probably new to most people the bad guy was pathetic the plan she sort of vaguely has something to do with stealing an atmosphere for some reason to do something for some reason that wasn made clear to finish the plan of somebody but she doesn say who that was or what their plan was and she is not in any way threatening her acting sucked also the whole premise was idiotic it could have been interesting if they had some kind of plan or plot before filming started instead of trying to fix it in post production so what we got was sometimes three characters one who fires light stuff one who makes glowing purple stuff and one who can apparently see light so she claimed in the script that her power is to not be blind who sometimes switch places when they use their powers but sometimes they don it extremely inconsistent and only happens when convenient for the plot or when some script writer with no sense of humour thinks it would be funny then lasers and flying around and fight scenes and some very sketchy cgi and that it tuned out for most of it got bored after while and so can remember most of what happened so ll find out from future pitch meeting who will do much better job explaining the film than my semi coherent rambling ', ' this black widow movie should ve been third entry to black widow trilogy in the infinity saga feel like it would be better that way because even if this movie is more about her origin it would be better to see it better if it is seen firsthand in movie in phase 1 this movie really feels like it not first entry but more of third with everyone in it taskmaster is definitely an underutilized character feel like the movie just barely scratched the surface of the character feel like taskmaster is pretty underdeveloped in this movie don know taskmaster could get pretty developed in the thunderbolts timeline wise this movie takes place in between captain america civil war and avengers infinity war the post credits scene takes place after endgame and before the hawkeye series that may be the only reason for why this movie to release when it did but still feel like this should ve released between civil war and infinity war with 2 black widow movies releasing before it within the previous two phases feel like that is the main way to make this movie better you don have to change the script much of this one just add two more movies of this lead character and you have it ', ' don waste your time here the family dynamic is comedic and love the realness about them regarding their culture the superhero character is just bad feels like m watching disney teen show and not mcu movie series ', ' first let me be clear am real person not bot ve been reading multiple articles claiming that people are review bombing this show and how if you remove all of the bad reviews it is actually one of the top rated marvel productions that is ridiculous statement ms marvel is just terrible period watched all six episodes of the ms marvel series ve enjoyed watching every marvel movie and series with my family of 4 we are big fans each of us having our favorites none of us enjoyed ms marvel it was boring slow slow slow and the acting was just awful kamala and her mother were the worst but there were no performances by anyone in the series that d consider good or even slightly interesting in all six episodes combined there was maybe 20 30 minutes total of interesting action the visual effects were actually pretty good but way too many long drawn out scenes and conversations painful when your children groan when you suggest watching the last episode that really says something right ', ' have watched this movie twice the first time couldn believe how lame it was here are arguably the greatest marvel superheroes all come together the budget is tremendous the actors are outstanding and the cgi is out of this world but what happens nothing of any interest nothing that was truly necessary in pushing anything forward walked away the first time disheartened time passed and thought no surely wasn thinking straight everybody loves this movie m clearly wrong but wasn wrong this movie is just heroes fight each other slightly and then random aliens there was no brave step taken reminding me of how disney also handled the star wars films the same problem was here nothing was brave and nothing new was done don put spoilers to my reviews but this film is by the numbers and surprisingly not that good if you re marvel film fan or you just want to wind down do zero thinking and just watch hulk smash then this film is for you marvel comic fans and other fans of great cinema will find this to be rather large letdown ', ' the punisher has potential but moves far too slow for what it is trying to do the first half of s1 could probably be condensed down into two episodes far too much time is wasted on frivolous side plots and scenes that contribute nothing to the overall story this would be excusable if those scenes led to any sort of character development but as with most marvel entertainment productions the characters are paper thin which is fine since it operates in the superhero genre madani entire arc is extremely boring especially since the corrupt cop soldier angle has been played to death in marvel other netflix series already the show needs to focus more on frank and cut down plodding scenes that contribute nothing but confusion to show that is at its core action based ', ' the marvels at times the trio act like the simpsons or maybe the three stooges but supply as many laughs as both of those in their prime well it all carol danvers fault after she destroyed rhe supreme intelligence the kree have civil war which ecologically wrecks their home planet hala and damages their sun we learn this at the start dar benn the new leader of the kree retrieves one of the quantum bands of which kamala khan ms marvel has the other half dar benn harnesses the power of the band to tear open jump point in space this causes damage the resulting anomaly is investigated by from separate sides by monica rambeau and carol danvers when rambeau touches the anomaly she danvers and kamala switch places through teleportation the switching causes the three to fight each others kree enemies this results in some slapstick comedy scenes which also advance the narrative how will they sort this out nick fury is involved as well so is the lovable cat who sprouts tentacles from his mouth and swallows the kree leader henchmen and many kittens appear the skrull once again have to be rescued by the trio and danvers learns lessons about her great white saviour complex we even get planet where the inhabitants communicate through song colourfully dressed like aliens from stos or early episodes of stng some great battle scenes and one to combat all delivers with soupcon of humour not the greatest of the marvel films this is the 33rd film in the marvel cinematic universe mcu but well worth watching directed by nia dacosta who co wrote the screenplay with megan mcdonnell and elissa karasik 7 5 10 ', ' watched all the movies again since on lockdown infinity war and thor raganrok was really good but this is my fav one of all of them ', ' anyone gave 5 to 10 stars for this absurdity who is past 18th birthday not comic book publisher marvel fanboy and does have girlfriend please raise your hand no one thought so the movie is atrocious there is plot plus compared transformers movies but it is so simplistic and full of tropes deux ex machinas lost count how many times loki magic staff was used to explain everything and advance story from brain washing to destroy portal opening device stereotypes predictability and cheap juvenile pg 13 jokes it becomes parody wonder that was the intention self mocking with movie concept characters genre etc because there is no way this movie goes unpredictable or might surprise you ending credits might have said from producers of scary movie or meet the spartans final cgi explosion filled fight scene another parallel to transformers movies against alien invaders where no one was harmed due to rating was so messy with headache inducing 3d scenery you either had to get out of theater for fresh air or close your eyes and ears did former the result is box office inflated animation due to marketing hype except cgi special effects overuse it has little cinematic quality actors try to make something out of their characters but child like character material gives them little chance on that comic book fan boys please stop comparing your live action stuff with oscar winning material you display your ignorance and make yourselves ridiculous cinema does not revolve around you am glad that you got your live action clip but for the rest 99 of us living on this planet who do not know know or familiar with resource material the avengers was badly edited predictable and sometimes cringe worthy movie and am using movie term very lightly here ', ' didn dislike the movie and it was enjoyable but would have loved for it to be magnificent as this is movie about black widow think we all can agree that this movie should have come out long time ago and the story could have been much better would have loved to see more about natasha past ', ' had previously written review based off of this show first four episodes and gave it 7 felt that as of that time it was an average show and that it could go either way most of the first eight episodes were good couple were great even but episodes nine and ten were stellar this series earned its 8th star the main characters are good agent coulson skye and agent may are all very good and though some would disagree find fitz and simmons both likable as for the minor characters the people making this show aren afraid to make up new characters whether they re hero or villain super powered or non super powered they already have couple of compelling villains that are driven by more than simple greed or madness the show special effects are particularly good which you might well have guessed the show uses offshoots of classic story lines such as extremis they also make references to the events happening in the marvel cinematic universe at large they are also beginning to link the events of individual episodes together very nicely there is good deal of mystery as to what happened to coulson after the battle of new york and skye and may rather ambiguous background is intriguing on the downside the show contains some gratuitous content and m not talking about showing blood in the action sequences or anything mean including things that are genuinely unnecessary also some of the dialogue is little cheesy additionally some people who have seen lot of television might find some of the plot elements predictable although personally don let me stress again this show had potential and as of the most recent episodes it is fulfilling it it is truly earning its place in the mcu ', ' this movie feels so seperated from the mcu that for me it was hard to see it as marvel movie its just an action movie without the marvel flair ', ' this series is so funny since kamala so relate with mostly teenage fans of marvel mean who doesn want to have superpower lets open our hearts to this new actress idk why so many ppl doesn like iman think they re jealous with how lucky iman can be recruited by marvel ', ' if you have just started watching wandavision or the falcon and the winter soldier you should watch legends 1st it will give you an overview about that character which you are going to see in the series if you re true marvel fan getting goosebumps and feeling emotional is just normal while watching this show ', ' season 2 much like its predecessor is accomplished in many ways thematically poetically cinematically and structurally ignore the haters please and watch for yourself you will understand there a true development of character structure the good and bad guys have neuances of being both good and bad and the story rests on the hero inside rather than her physical prowess which if you get to view the show that exactly what addresses too much focus on the external and yet this is but one of many themes embedded in the 13 part series ', ' by geeks about geeks for geeks tempting the geek dollar out of its den into the local multiplex with thrill that can be bought on the xbox is it the west wing in space or is it stargate meets men there is not shred of originality or true imagination in this noisy flashy ugly commercial behemoth it is part of an action figure marketing campaign film made by men who still think like pre teenagers who were inspired long ago by comic books cheaply churned out by groups of at most six people who at least had grasp of characterization the now grown comic book readers have to remain in their adolescent playrooms and pay homage to that excitement because they dare not go out into the world and feel real suspense fear or loss they must burn gazillions of dollars and employ thousands of people in trying to recreate that comic book buzz long lost childish thrill is the only feeling they are willing to let themselves or you experience will you join them will you sit in darkened room pretending that you are engaging with life because you have 3d screen surroundsound and broadband connection will it be enough for you to escape into joss whedon stunted teenage netherworld or will you go outside and attempt to engage with god forbid strangers rather than aliens superheroes and vampires there are movies even trashy ones that will echo embellish and enhance your experience of the world avengers assemble isn one of them it shiny expensive overwrought trash that assumes we are all as insecure stupid and frustrated as those who created it you will have forgotten it long after you still remember how much it cost to get in choose life ', ' the avengers was the first movie saw in theaters three times and for darn good reason it sets the bar so high for comic book movies dc is was seriously in lot of trouble after the avengers came out if you have seen each of our hero individual films you will easily enjoy the avengers ten times more you will be also ten times more excited to see everything played out also feel like need to say that was very very nervous when heard the avengers was announced in film we like to focus on one character and we like to see that one person change over the course of the movie it hard to keep track of multiple characters which is why the single hero format works so well otherwise we end up with meathead city like the expendables gross luckily we have the avengers instead so our unlikely heroes team up together to defeat thor brother loki luckily all of these overpowered world savers are used to having each other as company psychnotreally they all have pretty big egos let be honest but we don see just how big their egos are until they all share one movie together jump ahead they have to learn how to cope with one another and just barely tolerate each other in order to stop the world destroying threat there is some absolutely wonderful cinematography put together by seamus mcgarvey did mention how clever the script is joss whedon poured his fricking essence into the pages of writing and it pays off so very nicely don feel like the avengers was missing anything that ticked me off also have never been so excited for sequel before in my life my only hope is that disney can buy out spiderman from fox and we can get some spiderman action in there but digress the avengers flat out rocked my socks off 9 10 ', ' just saw the avengers movie and still don know what to say about it its funny that real everyday people write real reviews on this moviesite and the next entries placed above the reviews are from fake accounts giving this movie 8 or 10 stars real talk this is 5 star movie its good but not great the avengers is first of all not the best movie ever made nor is the avengers better than the dark knight or even spiderman 2 if someone tells you different they may have the mind of five year old the action is good and the characters all play their roles great but something is missing in this movie if the main villain loki and his crew of aliens became threat to any city in the s would laugh and take my chances am the only one wondering where were the s airforce marines army or even the navy when whole entire city is being attacked who were the aliens shooting at when they came from outerspace they sure wasn hitting the people running around in the middle of the street during the entire battle scene did any hardworking bank employee cop or other random person running in the street get hurt didn see any bad writing and action sequences ruined this movie was also wondering couldn thor just electrocute most of the aliens for about 30 mins instead of fighting them one on one he can control lighting would still say this movie is entertaining but watched by fans and viewers with common sense this movie is comedy and very very very overrated ', ' seriously this series is very great the main character is very well played jon bernthal is amazing it my favorite marvel character the season one was perfect and the season two follow the rhythm very well there are blood violent death and lot of badass action with 26 episodes the series is produced by marvel television in america the story explain the death of frank castle family and his revenge famous in the criminel world by the name punisher ', ' it was kind of boring would have liked to have seen how they developed the young natasha and yelena into widows we only get their present angst and disdain of their past the lighter moments were few and not very entertaining none of the characters could deliver the funny line the fight scenes which dominated the movie were pretty good but the story just didn appeal to me so think all action and superhero junkies will find something to like here but its just temporary high the movie is very forgettable ', ' not sure if this is supposed to be mash up of an after school disney special about coming of age or marvel show her powers are different from the comics and the pacing throughout was all over the place no rival no villain just her wanting to be rebel with her push over friend who seems to be under appreciated and taken advantage of the marvel shows are starting to lack quality and seems like they re barely referring to the comics when they come up with these ', ' didn really have any expectations for daredevil after watching the movie as kid and not overly enjoying it think marvel has done an amazing job now that they have daredevil back in their control love how mature it is compared to the other movies shows marvel have been doing in the mcu the dark tone and violence they have incorporated will please lot of people that have been wanting to see that from marvel me included the cast and the writing are excellent and look forward to possible appearances by other characters that daredevil has either worked with or fought against in the comics very excited to see what else marvel can produce with their characters that have yet to hit the screen ', ' am from india and really waited for this series but after seeing it plot and propaganda absolutely hated the series there no cohesion of character evolution this should have been animated in my opinion even if the target audience was 10 14 year old kids it lacks the depth of the original source and reinvents the main characters origin story it was so hurtful its like watching spoof with no plotline and dumb have no idea why they decided to make series out of it instead of introducing kamala khan in the upcoming captain marvel sequal and now am having second thoughts of watching the movie ', ' this show is extremely stylized and very enjoyable came in with zero expectations disappointed by the change from her comic power changes overall it a fun watch the family is fun and believable like the idea of things like avengercon which further expand the lore of the world it definitely appeals more to teenage audience but it was far from as bad as some of the negative reviews would have you believe there is nothing woke in the show it just normal pakistani american family living their lives there nothing wrong with that ', ' the first few seasons where phil is in charge everything is nearly good after that just arrogance of all the characters its like if they kill anyone its okay if other does its not this gets worst as you progress it just looses sense it was headache for last few seasons as barely anything was making sense ', ' this avenger film is really boring don knw why do they even made it while watching this film literary fell asleep twice ', ' m sure some of the fan base will like it it did not really keep my attention hopefully ms marvel will be better in the movie watched it to keep up that it ', ' what could have been very inspiring entry to the marvel universe turned out to be very low budget disney production it feels like it was rushed and tokenised without providing it with an artistic value solid story or just shallow good entertainment ', ' it should more interesting if it was pure hindi dubbed ', ' did not understand if the audience was for children or teenagers but don think definitely is for adults the story to save the universe is totally mess random scenes without connection the actors parts are confusing the sci fiction mostly quite poor with lot noise in the background they dragged the plot with repeated choreographic battles and repeated scenes until 1h 30min adding slapstick comedies that made the movie still worse the scene of the cats is then absurd and ridiculous ingesting and vomiting everything around then reached the barrel of the movie the movie it is not worth to be watched in the cinema ', ' well what can say season 2 of the punisher was as good as the first season in regards of action it was even better great fighting scenes tough violent gory all you would expect from punisher series all the actors did good job the episodes were well written and directed so kudos to the producers netflix marvel and everone lese who was involved in making this show happen just hope there will be season 3 but doubt it after cancelling daredevil and some other marvel series on netflix think it is not far fetched that this one will be cancelled on netflix too and it is very doubtful disney will pickup and bring the punisher on screen as netflix did it just doesn fit to disney ', ' first episode it lazy and after watching it there is no reason whatsoever for second episode because you get the full idea pretty straight away acting is very average the effects are lazy the whole thing its pretty lazy it simply boring and not worth waisting time on watching more any kid could direct and write this ', ' bad acting dialogues without any real meaning just to spend time emotional break downs with no obvious reason and daredevil who in every episode is beaten to death kingpin is portrayed like weak nice guy with anger problems foggy doesn convince even himself and the more time he gets the more you want to forward the scenes 6 only for the atmosphere and punisher ', ' am huge marvel fan while haven read most of the comics in years still enjoy the characters stan lee is genius and it is wonderful to see his creations coming to the big screen and not be poor bad acted cheesy knock off this movie says it all it shows everyone exactly why they love these comics and that is simply that we can all be more than the sum of what we are or perceive ourselves to be the prior movies are also very close to my heart iron man sold me on robert downing jr again as an actor and someone who can rise above rdj personifies iron man perfectly there is no other actor that could ever come close the turmoil he has in this movie the battle between his ego and doing what is right despite personal loss is well it a work of pure art chris hemsworth once again shows the world that man can play god he does it with grace and strength and with my humble opinion human element knowing that while he is stronger than all of his counterparts physically except hulk he is also weak he gives character that could have easily have been i am better than you because am god sense of humanity and humility thor is protector of earth and he protects her with fierce resolve mark ruffalo while was bit disappointed that ed norton would not be playing hulk was happy and thrilled with the choice mr ruffalo shows all aspects of the hulk with smooth fluid motion the anger he has to contain the control he has he should teach class on anger management he shows what believe to be true hulk the human that fights the beast within who among us can say we don have little of that in us chris evans he was the torch cocky show off that loved the lime light was worried about him being soldier the soldier when saw captain america was blown away by his scope something he continues to bring to this movie he portrays the captain as soldier soldier out of time and yet he is quick to adapt and lead group of people that you wouldn imagine could be team he honors captain america with his portrayal of him jeremy renner haven seen many of his movies but the ones have have enjoyed immensely he took character that could have easily been just side note and made him shine showing the elements you would expect to see in an assassin truly hope that we get to see solo act for him think it would be worth it scarlett johansson continues to portray the black widow with skill and grace she is beautiful and deadly the perfect black widow maybe movie with her and jeremy renner something to think about samuel jackson as nick fury was inspired and in this film you actually get to see more than just nick fury popping in for some advice giving and then popping back out he shows that nick fury is bad ass to be reckoned with even standing up to those in charge when he knows their decision is wrong clark gregg aka agent coulson will tell you the truth here thought he was nothing more than filler but he nearly stole the show for me he did an incredible job and has in all of these films he shows an agent that is direct and very much man in black but then you find that he well he has the biggest heart and he delivers it with fantastic dry wit the entire movie was bound together effortlessly with poise and that sense that we as lowly humans will not back down in the face of impending death but will fight it until there is no more of us the last person want to mention is joss whedon love this genius this man who can seamlessly put danger action and humor together he did it with buffy angel and firefly admire his work to the point that will watch anything and everything of his he was the perfect choice for this and can wait to see what he comes up with next the overview of this movie is simply words can no do it justice it was not just movie it was truly an experience you are sucked into the story shown by so many different aspects have been disappointed with some of the comic movies men final stand comes to mind someone please tell me where in the men comics did charles die last checked he didn and with those disappointments comes that lingering feeling of doubt that the movie will not live up to it hype was thrilled that not only did the avengers live up to its hype it surpassed it have only one humble request that the next one have spider man and wolverine recommend this movie to everyone as it is the personification of why we go to movies and why this business is multi billion dollar one that we all need to escape our tired lives for little while and be swept away to world where just for two hours everything makes sense the bad guys always lose and the good guys win with style ', ' such boring main character usual asian parenting drama which even we avoid showing here in india guys come on marvel clearly became disney now what next marvel giving tough competition to netflix ', ' season 1 showed promise but season 2 was just mess too many sub plots in season 2 that the story looks like merry go round such pity that talent like jon bernthal was wasted with such bad storyline bad acting made it worse lead by agent madani and the psychiatrist who both russo bedded ', ' one of if not netflix best show detailed behind the scenes marvel story ', ' movies first two thirds were pretty cool the last third was just trash like when the giant spaceship monster equipped with shark like teeth enters the city and starts to destroy ny with all its minions why do all evil things in movies have to have teeth and fangs why does the ship here have to have that also and make dinosaur noises mean does it eat other ships and chew on them reminds me of the movie green lantern when the all powerful yellow energy monster travels through space yet has to have mouth with sharp teeth and fangs and make loud scary noises this movie is decent but gets way over hyped for some reason think its because all the fanboys just love seeing all the hero together at the same time 5 out of 10 ', ' its not just the best superhero show ever its one of the best shows ever ', ' this show is nothing special if you see it expecting something near the avengers think twice this is formulaic series with touch of whedon agent coulson is not that good to turn it into leading character he ok for some minutes in major movie telling some silly joke but nothing more the other characters have charisma zero they should kill them all and start anew about the story its very simple and direct including speech at the end that is interesting for someone like me seeing got and mad men this is like watching casablanca and then spongebob squarepants ll give it 4 10 right now but it has the potential to go even lower s those special effects ', ' as its the 1st episode was so hyped that it would be great experience tbh but not part of my expectations came up to reality childish at its peak honestly let me guess yes it is the worst 1st episode and think the worst series that marvel studios have launched as can see everyone is spilling out negative opinion about it not at all cared but after the 1st episode regretted that didn care about the public opinion anyways 45 minutes wasted successfully ', ' really enjoyed watching this movie it was one of those movies that is like basically carried by single actress iman valini was really funny and spectacular and all her jokes were really funny and she was shining in every scene like that the movie was about empowering women all the superheroes and villains were women and we need more movies like this on the downside some aspects of this movie felt bit rushed such as the villain don think there was enough backstory about the villain usually in marvel they make us care about the villain but in this scenario found myself not caring at all just because it just feels like big bad villain that needed to be stopped as opposed to someone with goal and values on the agenda moreover carol danvers was good as usual but in some things she felt like she didn really want to be there at least that how it felt like it all in all it was really funny lighthearted movie carried by eman valini and her family with some noticeable shortcomings mainly related to the villain and carol danvers performance ', ' but sweet jesus this is painful ll say don think it the lead actresses fault she decently likable it more so the script the terrible music that forced in there the awful depiction of high school kids yet again how many kids are just dribbling basketballs in the highway so many lines belong on fellowkids sweet ll dm you the deets this is disney channel series for sure feels super forced like they only wanted this character in the mcu to be diverse not cause it a story worth telling feels like many things nowadays ll probably finish the series just cuz it be weird to not see this one chunk of the mcu but there zero chance ll watch again ve had to pause so many times from cringing ', ' let be honest all the previous marvel films leading to the avengers were great story wise acting wise effect wise etc iron man ii thor captain america all turned out to be surprise box office hits and one can see the point so when at the end of every movie post credits scene was shown depicting that there is something even greater planned the expectations were raised pretty high joss whedon firefly cabin in the woods took into account that set expectations of both comic book fans and non fans alike and put together superhero flick that ll rest proudly as the conclusion to its predecessors the screenplay writers the vfx studio the actors robert downey jr has always been my favorite all deserve credit an action packed blockbuster movie that already has every record broken and every voice cheering the avengers is one of the best movies this year must watch even if you re not into this stuff 10 on 10 ', ' over hyped and very underwhelming and sadly ranks alongside the incredible hulk in the otherwise incredible mcu does not bode well for avengers endgame and phase 4 if this is the path marvel is going down ', ' former marine frank castle jon bernthal is haunted by the murder of his family and his work for secret off the books cia operation in afghanistan he is assumed dead by everyone he works at construction site but even there he cannot retire from his punisher duties he is found by tech savvy david lieberman another member of the secret cia operation in hiding after corrupt cop presumably killed him agent dinah madani from homeland security is tracking frank castle not believing in his death frank insinuates himself into lieberman family the two dead men join forces to take down the corrupt cia apparatus in season 2 he is roaming america with new identity from the cia he rescues girl from team of military mercenaries she turns out to be grifter with many aliases and being hunted by powerful political family meanwhile billy russo has escaped with the help of his therapist and madani asks for castle help the first season is dark brutal story of ptsd and violence jon bernthal is perfect it is the darkest of the marvel netflix universe that rival jessica jones issues really appreciate something more than comic book action the second season has few problematic issues don the portrayal of the side character brett mahoney he is supposed to be dedicated good nypd cop but the story simply stacks up his incompetence as his dedication becomes nothing more than arrogance if the audience is to have any sympathy for mahoney he needs more in depth reasoning and understanding there is also no reason why castle wouldn simply explain some of the schultz case to mahoney or quite frankly madani sure he a man of action but few words would help here or there there is room for improvement in the writing otherwise love the schultz case the ghost and the girl at first was concerned about krista dumont from the billy russo side of the season but her twisted nature is nice highlight the only problem with that half of the story is again mahoney who seems utterly uninterested in recapturing rampaging killer the audience should see him as reasonable man in an insane world instead he abandoning fellow cops during shootout to chase after ghost he is self righteous when he is the character with the least information and that always makes him look stupid and arrogant don think he supposed to be stupid and arrogant it a problem in the writing in an otherwise compelling season of the marvel netflix shows this is one of the better ones ', ' when sat down to watch the avengers had little if not any hope that would enjoy it but was wrong what happened when the film started was collection of events that changed my little hope attitude into something much different after the opening scene was to say the least entertained but when tasked myself with the painfully easy job of rating this film all this film is is entertainment in time of dazzling cgi and insanely fun action sequences the avengers lives up to the hype but in world of intriguing plot immersing performances and emotional roller coaster rides the avengers is nothing but another transformers movie let me elaborate fans of the marvel comics will love this movie because it does what it says on the tin it effectively brings the heroes not all of them but some together in fist fight with destructive foe to marvel fan this is gold to film fan however this movie is little more than popcorn flick people enjoying this movie is not my issue want people to enjoy movies but when it comes to the rating systems on imdb and rotten tomatoes etc people have wrongly rated the avengers near to the highest of all ratings films like the godfather alien shane vertigo psycho blade runner goodfellas jaws and many many more films deserve the high rating because these are cinematic masterpieces these are films which changed cinema and have set the benchmark for all genres of today films but when see the avengers at the top of the ratings with them it disgusts me it should be rated fairly on an accurate basis of how the film is crafted and the impact it makes and for me it is 4 don get me wrong this is not bad movie but it is not classic nor by far masterpiece which renders most fans reviews redundant people can love this movie hell it can be there favorite movie of them all but they need to understand it is nowhere near the giants of cinema its not worth all the hype but its fun its not clever film the themes have been done to death and the twists are terrible but its entertainment so bid you farewell ', ' m not big fan of marvel films as find them very generic and un interesting but love this show the action scenes in this series put every single marvel movie to shame they are reason enough to watch this show luckily it also has great characters and story if marvel made there movies more like this would actually go to the cinema to watch them because wouldn leave disappointed ', ' one of worst marvel web series ever seen slow concept as compare to comics this was totally waste of time partition scene was emotional but marvel pretend to show india pakistan issues no need ', ' really wanted to like this movie florence is fantastic actress and ve always loved scarlett in this role but no amount of fine acting could save this one for me the plot is so convoluted and disjointed as to be almost nonsensical and there are so many plot holes and retcons with respect to the rest of the mcu this movie is too little too late d give it skip or at least wait for non premium viewing ', ' im sure will all like this series today rewached it again and its my 3rd time this is bcz it is an outstanding series which won bore up netflix have made fans like us more sad bcoz of its cancellation but this shoe must go on coz its pure masterpiece charlie cox we want daredevil pls come back soon we are waiting for 4th season ', ' in the vast galaxy of

making it violent as this series if any needs over the top violence really hoping for more seasons of this show on netflix or with disney ', ' hell of season they continue in the same way or even better this is the really punisher from the first episode was satisfied ', ' was great show and personally one of my favorite marvel series with ups and downs that will keep you watching till the end can wait for season 3 and certainly hope it as good as the first 2 seasons ', ' arrghhhhhh best thing on tv ever jon bernthal is incredible perfect portrayal of frank castle ', ' the avengers made movie history for the first time three stars each coming from their own successful solo movie met in an epic crossover this wasn really thing before sure you had sequels prequels spin offs and the occasional guest appearance but never huge connected universe like this this experiment could have failed miserably as was demonstrated few years later with justice league but marvel thankfully did put in the work to introduce and build up iron man thor and captain america and to lesser extent hawkeye black widow and hulk first ensuring that we as the audience actually care for all of them on the flip side this means that the avengers really doesn stand well on its own feet you could watch it as stand alone movie and still somewhat enjoy it because the action is great but the whole plot is rather basic and without knowledge of at least some of previous movies it will feel quite confusing but why would you do this in the first place when all those movies leading up here are pretty great as well ', ' daredevil was beautiful show that actually took its time to built character development from the ground up it so unbelievably sad that not single one of the new disney plus shows understand how important that is with disney in general everything is fast paced and humor based that was not the case with dd it was an astonishing show that had cast that actually cared for how important matt murdock story is charlie cox is phenomenal he brought such humanity to this role and your with him every step of the way he is daredevil there can be no one else vincent onofrio as kingpin is character study in it of itself such masterful performance the supporting cast is also stellar with the inclusion of deborah ann wall elden henson jon bernthal elodie yung and the wonderful scott glenn can say enough good things about this show recommend it to everyone that wants to experience true piece of art on streaming service in my mind daredevil will be the greatest marvel tv show ever produced ', ' is this typical mcu show no does it make any less worthwhile to watch also no after the seriousness and somewhat creepiness of doctor strange 2 this is welcome lighthearted and funny addition thus far to the mcu glad to see that they re bringing in characters with wide variety of experiences and backgrounds excited to see what happens in kamala journey moving forward ', ' from season 1 to 3 this series is amazing love everything about it love the look the acting the way feel like m watching comic book all of it unfortunately would rate this hard 10 of it weren for scott glenn m not fan of that actor or his his acting it almost cringe worthy if it weren for him you bet it would be 10 either way love the show would however like to see how elektra would look in her original red revealing leotard bandana and waistband thngie that would have been pretty cool can say though that m excited for born again hope they give it tvma rating but if it not m still excited ', ' after reading many of these reviews went into the cinema bracing for disaster was met with something that exceeded my low expectations but not by much first of all the fight scenes are exactly what you expect from marvel the plot was pretty plain and predictable but decently enjoyable at times wouldn rave about it but it a bit better than some have claimed it to be ', ' we re all going to watch their movies either way it actually pretty entertaining movie but doesn make lot of sense ', ' m loving the show with each episodes first episode was great and the second one is also quite good im surprised they actually represented the whole racial and cultural narratives very precisely the performances and the cgi with each shot was awesome someone wrote scott pilgrim ish and d agree if they were doing quick cuts but the visuals and each frame being worked on is unique to see the modern teenage drama with main character with different cultural background is quite an unique story and iman as the lead is perfect for the role im shocked it her first acting role because she so good in her performance the supporting cast is also quite great the family and friends but quite unrealistic behavior from parents sometimes south asian parents don dress with face paint to spend time with their children they honestly couldn care less about their interests believe me ve experienced it but overall an amazing series with lot of misogynistic haters and loving fans ', ' imagine if jessica jones hadn recently undergone the entire adventure with the defenders or had but learned absolutely nothing from it that what season 2 consists of poorly written character demonstrating no growth as human being and that the first episode the new season is simply bad the first episode does nothing to draw you in and the rest of them simply drive the viewer farther and farther away there no real villain the protagonist has grown even more self pitying and annoying and the supporting characters seem to exist simply to draw attention away from how weak the overall narrative is they could have done this with 2 hour film and not extended the series as they did would advise only fans of the lead actress to watch this program as anyone seeking superhero marvel film especially in the wake of thor ragnarok and the black panther will be hugely disappointed when you finally get to the end of the series you ask yourself why you even bothered to take the trip not good at all ', ' whigham is really really bad electra casting almost killed daredevil s02 and they did the same thing here she is out of place in every scene ', ' want to save 2 hours of your life just watch all trailers for this they re fun by this you can watch all the cool stuff of this movie wiithout watching the boring rest ', ' have always thought that black widow has been good character but this movie was just poor thought the intro was really cool and it didn feel like anything else we have seen in the mcu but after the intro we got rushed movie with poor plot and characters you never really connected to also thought the mcu taskmaster was bad and wasted taskmaster had some cool scenes but it didn live up to the mcu villian standard the second and third act felt rushed and forced was expecting more flashbacks like budapest but they never lived up to my expectations the third act was litteraly joke it was just poor and overexaggerated believe if this movie came out in the beginning of phase three after civil war it could have done better but coming out now when we have seen the new series like wandavision falcon and the winter soldier and loki it couldn match the same standard it wasn even good tribute movie to black widow m just disappointed but look forward to the new movies coming out in phase four because they can be worse than this ', ' never liked netflix creation in the past but this one is one of the worst this show isn cataloged as science fiction but this is one of the most ridiculous science fiction have ever saw blinded man the fight like bruce lee jump out of windows like spider man move like batman has ears of superman and and can kill room full of armed man guns m16 using his bare hands he can also see inanimate objects like fence with is hears only mean liked watching batman spider man superman simply because you believe for 90 minutes that there is man that can fly like spider or like bird that is the concept of scfi in this show you just get the filling that something is missing credibility you simply don dragged into it another thing that disturbing is the extreme violent this show tries to get some points by showing awful violent scenes like behead man head with door car or creating knifes from human ribs or smash head with bowling ball definitely recommend to skip this one ', ' at first thought this was just another ride the hype after the avengers production but gladly was mistaken the story is tight and the runtime 12 min but learned today that short is not always bad thing the effects are cool and rates high the acting is really good and the diversity between the persona of the actors works in harmony what can say except it made my cup of coffee in the morning taste lot better the only problem is how to fill 10 lines of review of short very good movie when there literally ain nothing to complain about ', ' it is power packed movie filled with breathtaking action sequences emotions faith power and most importantly the sarcasm and wit of the avengers very entertaining and must watch ', ' wow just came back from the cinema can tell that all the ravings about this movie are spot on had my doubts but once the movie started they were all gone great fun right from the start it a extravaganza for the eye it got its witty clever moments especially mr downey and the plot is right on as well you probably seen better evil than loki guess darth vader will never be beaten in this department but he still convincing enough so it doesn bother me at all hardly ever experience audience cheering and applauding in cinema but this exactly what happened when was watching this film so don wait for this to come out on dvd or blue ray coz gotta watch this on big screen and get lost in this along with others in the cinema no doubt that this is one of the best superhero movies ever made right up there with the dark knight ', ' this was actually really fun movie and the chemistry between the ladies were really fun to watch the movie had the right amount of drama comedy and the right amount of action especially the switching scene at the first act and the characters really brought this movie to life even though the story was weak and the villain was even weaker the character of miss marvel played by iman was truly fun to watch she was funny and she was dramatic brie larson did not over act or do too much in this movie which actually was kind of good for her because she took the focus from her main character and give it to the other characters and side characters and this movie is definitely going to be fan favorite for cat lovers ', ' fyi m not comic book fans at all hence this review is based on quality of the tv show itself with no bias at all found that dd review in this page is so biased my expectation was set so high esp after saw all these review from imdb only to be disappointed after watching it and my god last few episodes are not good at all dd is like ripped off version of batman and the raid combined into 1 show no plot it like watching green banana turn yellow so predictable and boring the only good thing in this show the fighting scene however good fighting scene alone is not enough for me this show is super overrated thanks dd fans who obviously never watched good dark gritty show in this world want to rate this show for 6 10 however since so many biased review here hv to lower it down to 3 10 ', ' ms marvel is fiction series based on marvel comics muslim family living in america story and screen play is good but vfx is really bad love this series as an indian audience and hope they don repeat this type of vf again ', ' find it little strange that they did this stand alone origin story for this character given what happened to her in the avengers series but there you go this one very much par for the course and it does feel entirely superficial with plenty of having your cake and eating it moments johansson and pugh play up their feminist credentials constantly with endless shows of strength and no reliance on men and yet they re constantly sexualised in those body suits what gives m not sure pugh was great fit for this anyway as her doubling is far too obvious throughout the plot is as generic as they come but there are lot of decent cgi effects and fun action sequences which count for something elsewhere was astonished to see david harbour in russian prison yet again and ray winstone cockney russian accent takes some beating ', ' when this show was announced have to admit didn expect much after the recent mishaps with agents of shield and agent carter thought this show would follow suit and not be anything more than filler between the long awaited films and as have just finished all 13 episodes am so happy to admit that was wrong daredevil takes place in hell kitchen which as my fellow scots would say is the arsehole of the word it a nasty horrible part of new york and it where our hero matt murdock aka daredevil and is lawyer by day was born and raised by his father jack murdock who was boxer after an accident that leaves him blind at the age of nine matts life changes he developed special abilities that are explained in the show so won go into them here and after number of years of very unfortunate events and intensive training he honed these skills and has become mask vigilante yes know clich but honestly it was executed very well and one moment nearly brought me to tears matt story is one of tragedy and angry which he later vents out on some thugs and follows the pattern of recent films such as captain america the winter solider and gaurdians of the galaxy where the main protagonist have tragedy thruster upon them the story then expands into much bigger story about one mans struggle to make his city better place and having to fight forces that are well equipped and as tenacious as he his enter wilson fisk who at first though was portrayed very strangely as was comparing him to the wilson fisk remember from the spider man cartoon back in the day and was expecting this very intimidating man who had unquestionable loyalty of his followers and was intimidating 24 7 but the more saw the more appreciated this take on the character he is violent and fiercely intimidating man on the outside but he a fragile being on the inside that has troubled past which bled into his present have to say that these two characters where played brilliantly by their actors the conflict between murdock and fisk was more that just fighting on the street it took more political route with fisk trying to destroy daredevils image whilst glorifying his own this added layers and complications to the characters and not just murdock and fisk foggy murdocks friend and partner in their law firm and karen page client that later works for them also find themselves sucked into this struggle against fisk along with an old fashioned reporter ben uric all played well by their actors in fact almost every character was portrayed brilliantly and has significant part to play one character that didn like was nurse called claire who ends up helping murdock with patching him up after rough fight it wasn her acting it was her characters reasoning and introduction which found too convenient and didn feel right that and the fact that some episodes just felt like they where put in to make it 13 episodes are two of the only major complaints have about the show and the later can be said about game of thrones or breaking bad so don hold it against the show too much what also liked was the dark gritty nature of the show which was refreshing from the light heartedness of other marvel projects it added sense of realism and relatability to not only the show but also the whole marvel universe and yes this is apart of the mcu there are references to avengers assemble and even the incredible hulk it was fun watching and seeing these references and knowing that whilst all this is going on that the avengers are out there stomping on hydra and the gaurdians of the galaxy are out in space doing something that a bit of both good and bad it also doesn beat this over your head but some references did feel bit clunky and unnecessarily ambiguous the action is well directed and violent and mean violent arms get broken and heads get smashed there blood and all sorts getting sprayed around and it awesome especially when it a fight scene with daredevil which oddly enough are majority of them he a bad ass and you get to see well hear the world as he does when he in these fights hearing heartbeats or when weapons get drawn picked up even guns getting cocked it cool and makes it feel unique to the character rather that just copy of fights in other franchises such as batman but whilst he is bad ass he does take beaten which makes him feel human and you are in fear for his life especially against some advisories who can match up to him it makes fights interesting and tense which is rare in the superhero genre these days outside of fights the cinematography is really nice especially when they film scene all in one shot which usually happens before fight it cool and can be appreciated by people who do appreciate that type of thing like myself all in all whilst it does have some flaws daredevil is fantastic start to marvels new line of shows m genuinely excited for jessica jones luke cage and iron fists tv debuts and of course to see the devil of hell kitchen again must watch for both fans of the marvel comics or of the mcu as well as average tv watchers 9 10 ', ' it took four years to make the avengers by joss whedon but it was well worth the wait the story takes place in new york in 2012 the avengers are made up of iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo thor chris hemsworth black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner the main antagonist of the movie is loki tom hiddleston the movie is an action comedy adventure sci fi film the movie is two hours and twenty three minutes long and by the end you don want it to be over in the beginning we find out that earth has found the tesseract an object that can provide an unlimited source of potential energy it suddenly activates and opens portal to another world where loki comes out of loki threatens to wage war upon earth now it up to nick fury samuel jackson to find way to stop him he is part of an organization called h e d and he brings together team of super humans to form the avengers to save the earth from loki and his army along the way the avengers get into arguments which allows loki to get away loki ends up opening the portal again and his army is able to come to earth will the avengers be able to stop loki and his army you will have to see the movie to find out loved the acting in this movie think that what made the movie what it is don think could choose one favorite but if had to it would have to be between the hulk and iron man the hulk is my favorite because he is genius when he is normal and he smashes everything when he turns into the hulk the funniest part of the movie would be when the hulk punches thor while fighting loki army the only thing didn like was that he only became the hulk two times throughout the entire movie iron man maybe my favorite because he is funny and cool he is funny and intelligent thought the entire movie he is funny for example when captain america asks iron man if you take off you armor what are you which iron man responds with uh genius billionaire playboy philanthropist another thing really liked about this movie is the story not for one second did find the movie boring or unenjoyable kept my eyes glued to the screen the movie has all the things movie needs for example the movie has humor action and an amazing cast also think all the characters have the right amount lines and everything is distributed evenly not one actor is more superior to the other all in all think the story was amazingly written after reading this review bet you understand that loved this movie everything about this movie in my opinion is perfect would recommend everyone to see this movie and not only at home but go to the theater and see it there you will not enjoy it at home as much as you would in theaters would give this 10 10 or must see movie ', ' have been watching tv for 50 years have seen so many shows about so many subjects with some of the greatest tv stars of all time this show is perfect in pretty much every way so many comic book subjects have been covered in movies and tv series but none have been this good from the first episode to the last it will keep you in the story they hold nothing back it depicts real life in the realist sense do not review many shows usually the ones that really made me think or moved me in someway when review things the first thing consider is is this show worth your time there are so so many things to watch and only so much time in day this show is worth your time there are not many seasons due to marvel being scooped up by disney am hoping they rekindle this tv show if you have recently watched the new doctor strange movie charlie cox makes cameo so hope springs eternal ', ' okay first of all am not your snooty critic who likes silent movies artsy stuff love the action movies super hero comics loved captain america movie iron man was good too however this movie was mindless crap there were no plot variations dialog were comical at best it was just pointless cgi effects the villain had absolutely no depth and frankly was brainless at least change the script bit put in some variations in the script and hire actors who have depth in acting captain america at least had decent story line you could connect with the character the same with iron man and the same with the spider man series this one from the start was just mindless violence aliens blowing up crap all super hero movies should have good story line villain who can many shades to their character that why dark knight was so good not only because the script had some meaning terrorism seeing the good versus bad in people and of course heath ledger amazing rendition of the joker realize this isn a movie that will win an oscar and also it meant to park your brain at home and just enjoy but at least put in some effort instead of just letting computer animation take over hollywood is getting lazier by the minute ', ' don understand all the haters who are calling this kids show most spider man stories start with him in high school and no one calls that kids show this show is culturally diverse and has really cool cinematography it incorporates technology in clever timeless way am really excited for the next episode think people complaining have qualms with other elements of the show they don identify with so they are trying to write it off as juvenile don listen to the haters give it chance ', ' when these kind of movies will stop and direct some new type one ', ' it hard to grasp how bad this movie is acting is so bad it awkward plot doesn make any sense literally painful to watch zane ashton is the only character that does some ok acting most of the plot is absurd argumentation is pointless many thing are not explained solutions to problems are idiotic and there is sense yo extremely forced inclusion random music choreography makes it even more strange and out of place at least if the songs were good or catchy it would be justified but it just cringe and annoying it is not clear to what type of public this is pointing to what is clear is that you have to lack common sense to enjoy it ', ' based on 2 episodes but you are given clear indication of the shows style writing and the theme of how the series will develop which isn appealing in my opinion putting aside my views of disney jumping on the political and woke bandwagon of everything they re involved with m focusing on the acting and writing etc very childish bad timed jokes and humour the acting due to this comes off as poor but with bigger budget as marvel fan ve tried to like this and watch it but find myself constantly hitting the stop button thought maybe it was cause m and adult but there are still loads of teen films and series from the 80s and current that love and they don have the same poor childish pathetic attempts at humour maybe given the culture its based on the humour had to be very respectable but even so everything seems poorly timed and awkward just not very good show and thats ok guess can expect to like every marvel show just cause its marvel but yeah disney seems to have changed marvel since the end game was done with ', ' the total story seems disoriented and loose can understand it not made with huge budget but don think the budget is only the constrain for this show the story is clearly this is made for kids not for grownups disappointed ', ' this show stretches the feel good and relatable parts to an insanely boring pace most of the show is just them trying to get the audience to relate to the family and the culture it trying to be so woke by trying to get the audience to be empathetic to this culture it just dumb do not watch the show it sucks ', ' it a fun creative show about fan girl in super hero world who gets powers through an object passed down in her family no spoilers here it in the first episode and not surprise give it fair shot ', ' this is such mess scarlet johansen went to court over profits from movie m amazed she want to be accociated with this mess any more than she need to be ', ' remember the first time knew about this film was excited to watch my favorite superheroes come together in single movie the anticipation and build up was so high and think it paid off not only was this solid and relevant addition to the marvel cinematic universe franchise it was technically well done the plot was engaging the scenes were action packed and the story opened up to lot of storylines that are essential to the continuity of the storyline the visual effects were so good it felt almost like it was ahead of its time my only problem was that there were too much talking scenes ', ' just masterpiece you must watch daredevil right now ', ' while it doesn reinvent the superhero genre captain marvel is fun ride with unique plot structure and plenty of twists turns ', ' watched first episode and disappointed don know why marvel launched this cringe show under their banner it is too childish to watch was watching with my friend and he didn like it and ran away from my house don think so he will watch the 2nd episode after watching the trailer didn have much expectation about the show and thank god coz this show is made for children bad jokes bored me screenplay was predictable way she got the superpower was very cringe no one acted well in the show except that boy who is her friend in the show if second episode will turn out good watch then will continue watching the show otherwise will stop watching it like my friend did ', ' was surprised how much liked it after the negative reviews it was fun watch all marvel movies just for completeness sake but this one was much better than expected brie larsen is great as always iman vellani is wonderful as ms marvel the entire movie brought me joy it was funnier smarter and more engaging than secret invasion which was just waste of sam jackson and other talented cast if you like teyonah parris watch they cloned tyrone she is wonderful in that she did good job in this movie but she was much funnier in that one wasn thrilled with the ms marvel series but would love to see more iman vellani she is wonderful would watch second ms marvel series if it wasn so family oriented ', ' after seven episodes suddenly it hit me this is the man from n l a half century later but without the charismatic stars and with the self deprecating satire stripped away that doesn leave much there no edge no sense of realism there also no sense of fun plots are threadbare dialog is lame characters are flat and painfully stereotyped there also no feeling for the mood of our times covert organizations are hated feared and distrusted as they ve never been before but this series can bring itself to confront the issue it comes off as really weak propaganda in favor of the establishment position that some things have to remain secret but stories are so incoherent that it can even make that point effectively what really hurts is the vast potential that being wasted in the comics h e d was catch all place to toss leftover ideas or to explore new ones without interfering with the more valuable franchises in other words it a concept with infinite possibilities it a chance to go behind the scenes in the superhero world to go big and high tech against traditional adversaries like hydra or small and personal agents of h e d does none of this it totally fails to adapt any incarnation of the comic the brief jim steranko run alone offers enough ideas for great series this one manages to ignore all of them in fact after seven episodes it hard to tell what if anything it trying to be about we always hoped that joss whedon would find the success he deserved so that he could finally start churning out classic material like firefly unfettered by short sighted networks instead it seems that success has finally ruined him whedon has turned out exactly the kind of mindless network crap that we expected him to stand against he should feel embarrassed to see his name on it having said all that m not ready to give up yet what ve seen so far deserves rating of 1 or 2 but give it 4 for the interesting agent coulson character for the earnest if ineffectual efforts of its young cast and for just being there comic book adaptation never expected to see and most of all for the dwindling hope that whedon will take few days off working on the next avengers movie and kick this sorry mess into shape edit as d hoped things do pick up lot in the latter episodes of the first season the continuity of the movie captain america the winter soldier is integrated into the show which is huge help characters gain depth and the tone becomes darker d still like to see bit more emphasis on character as opposed to cliff hanger melodrama but at this point m raising my rating from the 4 to slightly optimistic 7 where 5 means something just barely worth watching edit 2 as we reach the climax of season two agents of shield is almost completely different show than the one originally reviewed it hard to pin down what been done but it enough for me to officially change my score to an enthusiastic 8 all the shallow artificial conflicts between characters have been replaced by deeper dramatic relationships the big story arcs especially the second shield and the inhumans are now much stronger and lot more imaginative it not exactly shakespeare but it great comic book adventure edit 3 the ending of season three was one of the most amazing bits of writing ve seen in an action series underplayed unexpected and unforgettable agents has evolved into the perfect video comic book jumping from one cool situation directly to another with just enough characterization to make it all emotionally involving top notch television by any standard ', ' just watched this in the cinema today and wow cried and smiled so much the ending was not expected and m exited to see what marvel brings next ', ' think there is some campaign by group to discredit the movie and see if they can affect the viewership of this movie just like what was done during the elections mean seriously the movie was nothing short of awesome just check out the bad reviews there are duplicates and many say the same thing over and over they were probably written using some spinning software and then auto posted too many fake reviews is becoming problem everywhere tripadvisor yelp google amazon and so many other major sites ', ' was expecting an origin story of the marvel version of this character but instead got bad second hand attempt at covering an almost frankensteined go at it think it would have been better if they had gone with the true origin and not whatever this was ', ' was highly skeptical of this series at first assuming it would be an attempt at cultural appropriation but instead find myself riveted and fascinated ms marvel is nuanced sophisticated treatment of rapidly growing segment of american life the culturally rich muslim diaspora iman vellani is absolutely brilliant as the lead struggling teenager full of zest and life trying to find her place in the world at the intersection of religion and culture fandom and rebellion the rest of the supporting cast is perfect portraying the interplay of complex dynamics in any typical family the fight and chase scenes are thrilling and do not seem made for tv the mechanics of kamala powers are interesting to watch especially her primarily defensive posture and utilization the production designs are excellent and immersive typical of new york and karachi with no pretense the soundtrack and costumes are amazing spot on as many have said the sensitive and nuanced portrayal of the savage partition period is much appreciated this entire period of history has often been shown as simple blood bath with little focus on the actual pain of individuals torn apart there is plenty of setup for what follows in movies and tv but it not often we get series dedicated to relatable teenager growing up in complex world ', ' waited awhile to start s3 knowing it was going to be the end of the series and after just finishing it am baffled more than ever that this show wasn picked up by netflix for more seasons and no one else has gone after it yet it is without doubt hands down the best of any superhero series on tv and as of this writing the best mcu series made maybe the people at netflix who get to make these decisions thought the season 3 finale was good series finale but to this fan it was great ending for fantastic new beginning for daredevil nelson murdock page as so the many streaming services cable networks and tv networks that continue to scramble to try come up with remarkable shows to rise above the insane volume of mediocrity being thrown at us to see what sticks am dumbfounded that this gem that was completely wrapped in bow with it depth of 3 great seasons creators cast crew wanting to go on plus huge loyal fan base desperately waiting for more was idiotically canceled the actors playing these characters are amazing especially the top supporting actors deborah ann woll elden henson as for charlie cox he was tailored made for this role fits it with such ease you forget every other role you ve seen him in when watching this show and in case anyone is wondering he absolutely wanted the show to go on so much so in fact he created an email account under the name of his baby daughter to sign the petition started once word of the shows cancellation got out we had to wait 2 years between season 2 3 this october 19 2019 it will be one year since the release of the incredible season 3 which personally was my favorite would think someone out there would be smart enough to grab ready made hit keep this show going but then again would never had thought netflix would make such blunder and let this incredible hit show out of their hands in the first place highly recommend watching this series just be prepared to be mystified extremely disappointed that these 3 seasons is so far all we are ever going to get what f ing shame ', ' liked how avengers met each other and how their relationships started building it perfect first chapter ', ' this show is incredibly corny and lazy and wb 11 cliche especially the last 3 episodes of very short 6 episode season bad acting cliche characters that give you no reason to care and the most unrealistic and non grown up project couldn even believe that this was approved there is nothing to like about the stupid looking powers of big hands and running jumps with bad cgi the directors are talented it a shame they didn have better material it looks like they made sure to let us know she is brown and labeled which literally means nothing because if you are aware you understand we are all the same it is sad because little by little they are going woke well no wonder everyone is complaining about this phase ', ' started watching with less expectations action scenes for every 15 minutes enjoyed the movie not disappointed ', ' this is the worst thing you ve ever done bree terrible the maximum she could play the leg of dead guard please marvel change larsen to any actress with her to watch this movie disgusting wanted to drill my eyes out this movie is worse than global warming terrorism the russian threat and even trump after this movie don want to go after the avengers after your film stopped believing in freedom and democracy what else will you take from me you ve gone lower than dc the only thing worse was ben affleck in the role of aging and farting on the set of batman but larsen surpassed him everyone knows that marvel asked imdb to remove bad reviews first movie scores were below 4 m disappointed ', ' this show made me feel embarrassed to watch it love marvel but what is this this show doesn belong anywhere near the mcu this show was horrible addition to the mcu and then all decided to give her movie are you surprised the marvels tanked don wanna have to do my homework of watching the horrible content to understand what happening in the content with potential to be great if you re not inspired then don commit until you are 6 stars on imdb is beyond generous marvel seems to be on tear of putting out as much content as possible regardless of quality not hard to make money off of dynasty formed by consistency keep the dynasty great be consistent with good content and the money will find its way in your pockets m sick of giving marvel the benefit of the doubt this show is embarrassing she hulk is embarrassing if you don get on top of this quality issue the past 15 years of credibility are all gonna be lost that means less money ', ' m happy because this probably finally spells the end for all these dumb marvel movies that the low iq sheeple flock to couple times every year but m sad because they were about to delve into what had hitherto been fox properties and that could have been good was also initially happy when they announced ms marvel series she easily my favorite newcomer to the comics imagine my disappointment when it was revealed that it was show for small children akin to any other disney channel or nickelodean series without any sort of nostalgic childhood show feel they could have learned something from the far superior wandavision the first few episodes of which are easily the best marvel content to ever come out of disney ', ' would compare this movie to wonder woman 1984 the story doesent make sense the action doesent make sense but its entertaining wont go into spoilers but expect 1 black widow getting punched repeadetly and getting trown trough many windows yet she will never get any scratches on her face 2 black widow survives so many things which normal person shouldent survive 3 helicopters that get shot to shambles exept for the cockpit which is magicly the only part of the helicopter which is bullet proof and then the next scene abra cadabra the helicopter is repaired again 4 karakters surviving falls from extreme heights 5 more plot holes then switch cheese but did laugh at all these things and scarlet is pleasent to look at so 5 ', ' let be honest ms marvel isn that great but it fits with marvel attempt to include diversity in the mcu forcing diversity into the universe isn that great ms marvel is likeable character but that all there is unnecessary inclusion for alterior motives shang chi and moon knight did the same but they were far better ', ' maybe it was the intention to make the marvels light breezy space adventure and while d question that idea to begin with they only really succeeded in making subpar one at that as someone who likes the first captain marvel more than most there just nothing about this movie that makes it stand out and just found it so disposable as result we re well into phase 5 now with still very little sense of an over arching story and really don think film that ultimately amounts to side quest is what they need to be making right now iman vellani really is the reason to see this movie ve only seen 1 episode of ms marvel so this is essentially my introduction to her and she so good in this movie most of the laughs come from her and she just got such an endearing quality to her that makes this movie so watchable in the sections that really drag she makes me want to watch the rest of ms marvel now just to see more of her and really hope we get more of that character going forward don really think there anything wrong with brie larson performance in this movie but the captain marvel character as whole still feels underdeveloped there a whole new lore and history that been added to her character in the time since the first film but it just doesn feel earned at all maybe with longer runtime some of her development could ve been fleshed out more but as of right now it just feels like there a whole movie missing from her character development really liked the monica rambeau character in wandavision but she given precious little to do here didn get much sense of character arc and all her conflict with captain marvel found to be really forced samuel jackson is effortlessly watchable as nick fury at this point but his whole role in this movie is to deliver exposition and spout of one liners which to me is waste of great actor in great role the story and pace are ultimately what brings this movie down for me the story is very basic and not in good way it feels like what would be middling two part star trek episode and as result it just feels like disney original rather than theatrical event appreciate the fact that it doesn have eternals or wakanda forever over indulgence but it runs into the exact opposite problem with this quick pace and short of runtime none of the ideas get any time to be explored in any meaningful way and this is most apparent with the main villain actually thought her motivation was interesting and could ve added really interesting layer to the captain marvel character but instead all of her back story is relegated to quick flashback when it really feels like whole movies worth of material could ve been mined from this character don get me wrong this movie is entertaining in spurts and didn hate my time watching it but as of now it already feels like it come and gone it automatically feels like one of the mcu more redundant entry and apart from really intriguing mid credits scene don really see this playing much into wherever the franchise is going next wouldn say had overly high expectations for this film but it frustrating to see yet another weak marvel movie after their recent slump m hopeful that the mcu can get out of this rut it in but really need to get some sense of forward momentum soon ', ' have watched every punisher movie to date jon bernthal is the best punisher hands down the action scenes are amazing the graphics are outstanding the story is good and it a very strong cast please netflix keep this show for few more seasons atleast find my self rewinding each action scene couple times to see them again hands down the best action in any tv show it holds more action per hour then most action movies with better quality ', ' saw the movie yesterday didn expect the movie to he this boring exactly opposite of the trailer expected this movie to be in line with the vibe of winter soldier what got was crappy version not enough action sequences story line was very slow not the way wanted black widow saga to end she deserves much better movie after all she sacrificed herself ', ' great action good storyline however feel like the entire show is shot in the dark why not just show black screen with audio ', ' have been huge fan of this show and really impressed with the acting and writing loved the gritty crime drama feel it evokes am now no longer fan will no longer watch this show and no longer will endorse this show on any social media site know that every american is allowed to voice their opinions as am exercising that right by writing this review but the cast as well as the producers need to keep in mind that we are in the midst of very contentious political race right now not just opposition parties but with in the parties themselves people like myself see this as very pivotal time for the country make or break live or die election that being said the fact that rosario dawson steps out and not endorses that would have understood but criticizes candidate or moral issue like abortion is game changer audiences are diverse and can run the gamut of the spectrum politically and morally she picked very bad time to make this type of political move would say that would convince all my friends to not watch the show but none of them do so not an issue will no longer endorse the show on any social media site and will make sure to include that fact in any of the many posts make day on very wide range of political sites ', ' what wonderful intro to super hero last time watched this type of amazing strong origin was iron man from 2008 it was amazing this version of nicholas joseph furi is awesome goose was another thing to watch ', ' this great movie it is very good this what happen when you take marvels greatest in one movie it was long time in the making you have thor prince of asgard then there is also the strongest thing in the world the the incredible hulk the greatest spy in the world hawkeye and black widow one of the smarts men on the planet iorn man aka tony stark with captain america the frist avenger as there leader the will become the avenger the will work with h e d with them there task will be to save the world it is about how group of unlike heroes come together the team take little time to get were they can get along in avenger it will not be that confusing if you have watch all of the movie up to this point it bring all the the past marvel movie of the last 10 years together they must face loki and save the world these movie is very good and fun to watch it let it let you see what it talks to be hero because have power makes you superhero but even without them you can still be hero as you will soon see if you watch these movie if you don believe me watch for your self believe that you will enjoy it very much will leave you with avengers assemble ', ' even nearly decade later the avengers stands the test of time as one of the greatest comic book movies ever ', ' it not the best movie have seen this or last year still enjoyed it wasn sure about brie when watched the trailer think she did good job but it could have been even better am not sure if this is her fault or the writers directors the story seemed kind of rushed at least compared to her origin history in the comics it still had really good moments it was funny and the fight scenes were visually pleasing if you are into marvel movies or movies that have powers and that sort of thing you will probably enjoy this movie am 20 years old and watched this with huge portion of my family mom grandma aunt etc they all enjoyed it it not groundbreaking incredible movie that will blow your mind but had fun watching it it really good for what it is am excited to see captain marvel return in avengers end game ', ' season one was great setup but lagging little behind daredevil and jessica jones but season 2 will have you enthralled within the first 5 minutes which puts nice exclamation mark on season 1 as if to literally say congrats on making the right decision to stick through couple of slow but necessary episodes in season 1 you have graduated to season of almost pure adrenaline ', ' brie larson didn prove anything with this crap the entire movie told us how great her powers are without proving thing in the mcu the action is what makes the stories work this is an mcu chic flick that insults every marvel fan left the theater wanting my money back total waste of money and time ', ' this movie came off as mostly an apology for not giving bw the movie she deserved 10 years ago it a fun watch but mostly forgettable and not must see for the mcu as whole it was wasted opportunity ', ' for me this movie just never really got going found it all bit dull and boring didn particularly like the action sequences or set pieces black widow is great character and an integral part of the avengers and mcu but just don think she is big enough character for feature length movie maybe tv series with her going on missions would have been better the huge plus in all of this is florence pughs character who was fun and engaging and had great chemistry with the widow after about the first 30 minutes just generally lost interest which is real shame as love the mcu ', ' felt weird when watching xmen in any other languages than american english since grow up watching all the classics and animations in english but again in this case prefer to watch it in the original audio japanese because the quality of the english dubbing were not that great although the storyline was okay generic but not fan of some of the messy action scenes that were very hard to catch up it was like rough sketch and not executed well in animation especially when wolverine fighting in the sky im not familiar with the men organization and not fond of hisako armor some bad choices like emma transformed into diamond for the first time although it worked well in this storyline nerfing storm power and skills glad they at least made wolverine as brutal short as in the comic and made cyclops as the jean obsessed whiny man sound scores were very classic xmen and animation style was okay most of the time overall not bad recommended ', ' screen time spent on scenes that removed me from the experience and began to muse it was made for television episode felt like it was aimed at some target demographic that wasn me so came here to see if it appealed to daytime soap audience and discovered the general reviews and score seem to indicate that at best it appealed to small percentage of viewers ', ' first of all this film was just boring to much cutting between the scenes even black widow coudnt carry this horrible movie they did taskmaster so dirty that it hurts to see this character getting wasted like this ', ' what should you do when you have been self proclaimed fan who has decided that he would make movie and bring all the superheroes from that universe under one arc step 1 go to the studio bosses and convince them of the idea step 2 talk to other directors and ask them to incorporate certain elements from the big picture that would help bring the final story in play introduction of nick fury in iron man continue in iron man 2 and captain america black widow in iron man 2 hawkeye in thor step 3 convince superhero to play guest role in another superhero movie iron man offering his consulting services in the incredible hulk step 4 now that all the superheroes have been linked under the mouthful acronym h e d you have the right background to bring the avenger initiative to the foreground step 5 go ahead and flesh out the story but make sure you play to the strengths of the each character iron man is sarcastic and arrogant with tongue in cheek one liners so he should get the best lines captain america is the leader so when the time comes he should bring the superheroes together and lead them to the final battle thor is the norse god and the only one who can bring loki to justice hulk is remorseful of his past deeds yet he is still angry indestructible as the green giant and can practically smash anything so his actions should speak louder than any words nick fury is the leader of the avenger initiative and he should do all that is necessary to motivate the super heroes black widow is the spy and her strengths also include close quarter hand to hand combat hawkeye is the expert marksman and practically shoot down anything with the arrows now that you know that the characters and their strengths you should ensure they get on with each others like house on fire throw in friendly banter ego clashes battle of brawns and brains in good measure then when all hell breaks loose bump off character to motivate the super heroes to band together then go all out in the climatic battle sequence with action extravagance and general dose of humor step 6 now add crackling screenplay to go with that goldmine story and you are almost ready step 7 take it back to the studio bosses and convince them of the plot if need be use flashy power point it usually works for all corporate presentations and makes everybody happy step 8 now that the studio has green lit the project sign up the actors who will make up the marquee lineup and you are good to go step 9 if you have the faith then go ahead and direct it bring in good cinematographer and you are good to go but don forget to add crackling soundtrack to match the mayhem on the screen now for the outcome brilliant action impressive 3d effects superb character play and some genuine laugh out loud moments make the avengers one hell of comic book adaptation it sets the bar pretty high for other super heroes as is the case generally iron man captain america thor hulk pale in comparison to batman spiderman superman individually in terms of popularity and box office pull but when you put them all together in one frame for all to see they sure bring in lot of fireworks it would do justice to them if you could catch the individual stories of all the super heroes before you go to watch the big one but even if you don there is whole lot of essence in this story alone to keep you going this movie has already won big reviews from the critics and fans are raving about it on the fb with loads of stuff dedicated to that special hulk and loki interaction in the end the big question that crosses all is has joss whedon succeeded in his plans the answer is yes he has changed the comic book to movie adaptation world and taken it to whole new level the bar is set pretty high for spiderman and batman who follow up this year with their own series so for the time being let us enjoy the ride of the avengers ', ' acting was awesome especially from florence pugh she stole the show her character yelena had fun relationship with natasha but also was the best character in the movie david harbour was also very good and made for really fun character even tho yelena and red guardian were great they took focus off of black widow natasha this is problem because the whole point of the movie was to let natasha finally shine but with the introduction to the new characters she ended up splitting the spotlight 3 ways since know what happened in endgame it took away from the action involving black widow there wasn a sense of urgency since know in the end she ll be ok marvel has this theme of using comedy in poor places and it showed in this movie yelena and red guardian share scene that potential to be really emotional but they threw some comedy in there and it took away from the significance taskmaster sucked as someone who knows little bit about the comics and has seen taskmaster in smaller tv adaptations she was extremely disappointing nothing but goon with not so interesting background 7 5 10 ', ' half arsed script and an eternity of explosions utter tripe my high point was when fell asleep even the sight of the delightful miss johansen wasn enough to keep my interest still it made lots of money so ve no doubt we will see follow up it seems that this movie is in the imdb top 250 m at loss to explain this understand that people are fans of the comic book series understand that this film will have it fans just don see it as holding any cinematic merit the acting is by the numbers and think we ve all seen enough of cgi films to last us another century if were 12 would probably have enjoyed it ', ' went into this movie having read the reviews and had very low expectations think the reason liked this movie is that m not at all fan of the newer mcu movies am or was fan of super hero movies think the best era was 2000 2012 loved the first two men the sam raimi spider man the nolan trilogy the first iron man captain america movies from marvel studios around the time that the first avengers movie came out is when started to think the mcu movies were going downhill fast the dc movies were no better but m only going to talk about marvel for obvious reasons they turned into mindless cgi team mash ups with no character development no back story and way too many cheesy unfunny one liners honestly started to wonder why these movies kept making money at all black widow feels like return to the style of super hero movie that enjoy it had back story character development characters pursuing real values rather than just good vs evil with endless drawn out boring cgi action sequences the humour was mostly well placed the action sequences while over the top at the climax were actually enjoyable throughout the film since they furthered the plot and didn drag on too long lot of the action reminded me of the bourne identity films which loved can believe that marvel managed to put out film that absolutely loved after decade of mediocrity but here it is alas great job ', ' brie was the worst hire of the mcu just not good fit when it came out and true to current disney form instead of changing gears to more enjoyable character actor ya gotta lean into what people are saying isn working had low expectations for this movie and it didn disappoint just cheesy watching it it felt like the actors were as uncomfortable as the rest of us the cats were good have given up on anything that comes out of this studio mcu star wars disney this is coming from past huge nerdy fan the assumption is everything new will be trash prove me wrong disney please ', ' superman the movie the dark knight and the avengers yes the avengers does indeed stand tall amongst the greatest superhero movies of all time stellar cast assemble to create marvel of film pun definitely intended the special effects are top notch and never look out of place like superhero movies of the past however it is truly the story that is most appreciated since it is the final act of an intricate tightly woven plot that has been building through the current generation of marvel films iron man the incredible hulk thor and captain america the first avenger and ends with the best superhero finale ever conceived for the big screen yes its that good the only factor that could have been reduced was the amount of humour and sarcasm following certain kick ass scenes which could have benefited with touch of cool in retrospect the humour mostly gets it right and compliments the comic book feel of the movie which is what we have all desperately wanted for so long comic book movie that truly sets your mind free like the comic books and cartoons we all read and watched growing up thinking anything was possible applaud you marvel as the avengers now stands as one of the greatest if not the greatest superhero movie of all time ', ' marvel is reaching peak soulless they have finely tuned industrial movie production where movies are produced using checklists and must have scenes the movie is just think plot to tie in sequence of introduce new location banter action scenes action scenes are boring and don advance the plot banter is forced new locations are just new locations ', ' the marvels is yes messy and viewers are thrown into the chaos right away saw this as terrible error for the first 15 minutes mistake to go in cold on plot that relies on familiarity with several movies and tv series that came before but by the time the protagonists got together learned to enjoy surfing the chaos adding half hour of exposition would just slow down the story and more importantly not project the confusion of the characters with rapid unfolding of complex events vital points of backstory are provided as needed by the characters it important to the story that captain marvel did not see the ms marvel and wandavision series events depend on lack of understanding and learning to trust the marvels is all about learning to trust in harsh and insane world and that the perfect view for these times ', ' worse marvel movie series and that saying lot after thor dark world and hawkeye this would be great if you re 13 year old girl or identify as one ', ' this is an offshoot of the marvel cinematic universe and sometimes an overlooked step child of the highly successful movies shield is global security institution tasked with protecting the earth by using superheroes and some supertech phil coulson clark gregg returns from the dead to lead small team of specialists the first year tries very hard to tie itself to the movies sometimes it to its own detriment it can help but feel inferior also the movies never returned the favor which only accentuated classic system between the two eventually the tv show stops trying so hard and stakes out its own path it does get caught up in mess like the inhumans but mostly there are some great season long serials with few stumbles along the way the show is able to find its own voice and its own cast of characters they have fun adventures and even with some surprises there are some very good years ', ' was looking forward to this and was not impressed the storyline was too common and struggled to stay engaged willed myself to watch it to the end yes it had great action scenes and effects but that is all would give it miss and wait for the disney release ', ' first marvel movie that not worth going to the cinema to watch don waste your time and money storyline was poor and cliche none of my family members felt invested in the story at any time including the ladies who went with me special effects and music were all right standard fare for marvel movies however effects and music don make movie great compelling plot storyline does wish to return to the days of the infinity war saga that was good in summary spend your time and money elsewhere and wait for it on streaming platform insert random words here to reach word limit ', ' with one episode in its hard to base the show on its actual merit but if the rest of this show is like it first episode than this show is an abomination to the predecessors please avoid at all cost should note m all for diversity bring it on please but this show literally gives these actors little to do so far the only likeable character is the bruno character ', ' should start this review by saying that am massive comic book fan and have been for as long as can remember whenever new comic book movie comes out get very excited and am either satisfied more than satisfied disappointed or mildly annoyed when actually see the damn thing the marvel cinematic universe earth 199999 has been building steadily since iron man more than satisfied and has been coming along nicely brick by brick with the incredible hulk yet to see iron man 2 satisfied thor satisfied captain america the first avenger more than satisfied adding more and more detail and continuity to the mountain we have now reached the avengers more than satisfied which climbs to the peak of the mountain to take it place as the epitome of an awesome movie went into the avengers excited disbelieving that this was actually happening and very very scared about how much would enjoy it due to the massive hype surrounding the film came out in state of great pleasure and thank the stars that marvel studios chose cult television genius joss whedon to direct and write it why did love this movie so much 1 joss whedon brought the spirit skill humour and knowledge that this film needed his previous works that have seen dr horrible sing long blog and firefly prove that he can create great drama and many memorable lines both meaningful and hilarious his twenty five issue run on astonishing men proves that he knows marvel characters very well and can write great superheroes with very human flaws 2 the actors were downright perfect for their roles and each one got an equal role to play robert downey jr iron man tony stark chris evans captain america steve rogers chris hemsworth thor god of thunder and samuel jackson nick fury director of h e d have already proved in previous films that they are great choices for marvel movies scarlett johansson black widow natasha romanov got just enough screen time in iron man 2 to show she was good choice for the character but in this she proves to be the best we could possibly ask for jeremy renner hawkeye clint barton appeared for five seconds in thor to shoot an arrow or two so he obviously proved nothing in that movie but in this one he proves to be superb choice for one of my long time favourite marvel characters mark ruffalo the hulk bruce banner is the only main newcomer in this film due to edward norton and marvel disagreeing with each other after the incredible hulk and proves to be perfect choice for bruce banner certainly better than eric bana in the horrible outing the hulk tom hiddleston loki god of mischief proved excellent in thor and continues his excellence in this clark gregg agent phil coulson plays the only character created specifically for these films and has become fan favourite through his brief appearances in previous marvel pictures agent coulson really gets his chance to shine in this film and shine he does 3 it set things up very nicely for future entries in the series 4 the character interactions were incredible and all of the heroes and villains were smartly developed something you can be guaranteed in joss whedon production 5 it looked great the costumes the fight scenes t were all very well designed 6 it had heart something you don get in most blockbusters 7 stan lee cameo 8 post credits sequence 9 harry dean stanton cameo 10 the hilarious lines such as puny god these are just few of the many reasons the avengers worked so well for me and all in all have to say that my expectations were incredibly high and the avengers went above and beyond what was expecting ', ' black widow definitely deserved movie and with this installment her sacrifice makes lot more sense within the mcu world loved the iron curtain aspects involved and the performances by scarlett david harbour rachel weisz and florence pugh plus the dynamic between them all just made the movie great several twists and turns throughout that kept the viewer watching it starts off bit slow but quickly gets going definitely glad that this film was made sorry there won be more with natasha but hopefully this one opens the door to more of her backstop and presence involved in upcoming ones ', ' bringing about retrospect of controversy in many portrayals it faired better than expecting truly wrapping itself in the shrouds of marvel to bring about beautifully executed adventure of teenage girl doing her all to save her world and that around it ', ' 10 star rating vs 1 star rating seems like something is weird here for me this movie is awesome especially with the visual and animation sorry my english is not very good ', ' not interesting at all there was no action until the end of the episodes it felt like they tried for disney kids show hannah montana type vibe they reached for laughs it definitely more child oriented maybe young teenage generation would have an interest do not ', ' waste of 2 hrs not worth waiting 1 year expected better storyline weak characters ', ' this movie offers simply nothing but as marvel fan we re gonna watch it anyway because we love black widow just like an anime filler episode it offers nothing you watch it cz you love the anime and you ve nothing better to do ', ' the idea is actually really good it the same that was in shang chi and eternals marvel is thinking we ve spent so much time in america kets go around the globe and m fine with that shang chi was really good eternals had the right idea but had too many characters introduced ms marvel is downright bad the plot and slow and her family members get way too much screen time and slow down the plot too many characters are thrown right at you and ms marvel is basically an annoying young version of mr fantastic and doctor strange combined her comic book powers come from her being an inhuman that seems much better than coming from fricken bangle the show is bad and the whole everyone review bombing ms marvel because most of it is set outside of the us and her ancestors aren american is bunch of bs shang chis dad wasn american and it was set in china and no one cared because it was good movie ', ' the marvels is as generic marvel film as you could think of what with its story of magic wearable artefacts spread out in the universe vague revenge story and the weight of the past destruction of whole planets and genocide big repetitive brawls in new exotic settings the earth being vaguely threatened and oh healthy doses of family bonding aboard shiny spaceships and space stations what would we be without those it the comedy that works best though and did enjoy kamala antics excitable super enthusiastic awkward kamala reminded me of peter parker in the marvel iterations and her relationship to danvers is not unlike that of peter with iron man without feeling as derivative as the rest of the film somehow getting fresh character with an outsider perspective on our heroes is always welcome idea and it works well here the singing planet and the cats are very fun too and they reminded me thought that flashed through my bored mind while watching dr strange in the multiverse of madness and quantumania mostly of how much wish marvel would let go and get farther off the beaten path towards more fanciful and whimsical territory la wandavision the drama on the other hand feels forced and incoherent both on the small scale the half hearted tension between danvers and rambeau and big danvers never seems that concerned with the consequences of her actions and tidily resolves at the end situation that should not be so easily solvable otherwise there is no real dramatic weight and never really was this in essence is formulaic plotting and weak dramaturgy at their very worst perhaps the most problematic however is how like many other installments the villain is only mediocre adversary with rotten character motivation that in turn prevents our superheroes from shining or proving their moral worth as they should oh well at least there the cats ', ' really wanted for this one and got this instead of what in the comic loved the comics and even animated series in and really had high hope for this one but it tirned out to be lil lame in my opinion loved loki and moon knight more ', ' after three seasons that felt like four m giving up on this show it stupid has no purpose in the mcu whatsoever and pretty much don give f about main characters daisy sky and coulson what started like an interesting spin off of mcu movies became name dropping self important drivel of tv show can easily say after three seasons that main character daisy sky is the worst part of this show she just too fake character is so bland uninteresting and unimportant and the acting is not good also you me as viewer just don care for her but the show and the characters in it just try too damn hard to make us force us care for her and it really exhausting after some point she also one of the main sources of this show pathetic drama moments and plots in the same vein of trying too hard coulson outlived his best days in movies and now he just trying really hard to be cool and edgy but ends up being like dad trying to be cool with the kids type guy it so annoying and wish both of them get killed off all the time during these three seasons while there are some interesting episodes and plots bulk of this show is just unimportant junk they live off of main mcu movies when they can and in the meantime they bombard us with stupid plots not important characters and shoving inhumans into our faces and no one cares about inhumans they re just trash fifth rate men that worked only as back characters in the comics shield itself is farce and while comic book shield was always an interesting and vast organization here it just some basement no name garbage group of like 30 people max although ironically agent carter got better in their second season than this but it got canned then they planned spin off of this with most wanted with bobby and hunter which were two of the better characters in this and then that got cancelled as well so we re stuck with agents of shield for at least one more season they should just cancel this one as well and leave the show side to netflix and not taint mcu any more with this garbage that just goes nowhere because if marvel doesn care about it why should we ', ' it hard to describe the failure of this movie which is an embarrassment to some of the actors and the whole franchise as this was one of the worst movies ve watched in long time there simply nothing good in it and couldn wait for it to end as it dragged and dragged 1 horrible acting by most just ok by some even when we know they can act better it was really bad there was no real emotion and fake it was just very very fake some actors weren chosen properly as well as in the indian family couldn act at all you want to see some good acting by south asian actors go watch shantaram this was like 1 10 other well known characters were also not very good 2 story was boring plane and lacked of any kind of depth or thrill to get you into it the script was very very poor 3 directing was embarrassingly bad and one of the reasons acting was bad too it seemed they took 1 take of everything and then poorly stitched the clips together at times it felt they weren even at the right time seemed like they selected all the clips then push the button called put those clips together in movie little humor poor acting lacking fight scenes out of the power ranger tv show you know what mean ', ' imagine putting superman vs regular human now make them marginally strong enough to tickle him but no chance of winning oh wait that happened it about that interesting literally fell asleep in this movie it was that boring absolutely no character development of any value literally mangled the source content the bad guy was more interesting that the hero complete abortion of film had potential wasted it ', ' watched jessica jones meh it bugged me when she could beat up one person no problem then have trouble with the next she has super human strength right same here with daredevil sometimes he can dispatch dozen ninjas but 3 convicts and he so winded and tired he can barely walk guess someone thinks it makes for good tv when bad guy gets away again and again from super hero just find it like horror movies when the people run towards danger idiots lol don think onofrio needed to do the raspy voice thing he sounds stupid in my opinion it doesn make him sound scary fight scenes are well done acting is better from some than others don think ll watch another marvel show the reviews said this was lot better than jessica jones sure little bit ', ' what great start especially for the brown girl in me that craved for representation growing up loved the everything that could relate too the salams the jinns the restrictions the food the hospitality everything screamed my household and for it to be superhero show m here for all of it that line brown girl can never save the day and she did just that it gives hope to all the little girls growing up so yes this show has been my childhood dream come true and m glad it about time they represented us ', ' disney takkng over marvel and starwars has been devastating for the production of these brands it such shame that everything has been disneyfied and made kids shown with mood fit for kinder garden ', ' this series is fun culturally sensitive and diverse it portrays picture of south asian families particularly pakistani and the impact of historical events such as the british colonisation and the partition between india pakistan enjoyed the food traditional weddings clothes markets and landscapes from pakistan unsure if it has been indeed filmed there loved the series and honestly do not understand why and how people have rated it so low it good that marvel moves towards diverse superheroes and away from mainstream american characters if you enjoyed the black panther which falls in the former category you will definitely enjoy this series ', ' seriously why are they using this cheap film style feels like m watching lifetime movie it cool that most avengers are vegan though superheroes for the animals 3 ', ' there are usually three special groups in the marvel universe one avengers two the defenders and three agents of shield maybe it can be said that after avengers agents of shield are the best group consisting of superheroes inhumans ordinary but skilled agents which made it good series events such as the return of characters after period of absence or even death presence in space and the existence of aliens time travel world in the brain and numerous fights with hydra made the series exciting the positive point of the series was that the team sometimes broke up and formed again and sometimes there were romantic relationships between the characters of the series most importantly although there were many episodes in each season the script and the series itself were so good that it did not cause fatigue ', ' after daredevil marvel netflix changed the concept of superhero shows jessica jones was the most awaited tv shows of 2015 after the groundbreaking success of daredevil thankfully j live up to the standards we imagined with added extra horror good casting and very well executed screen adaptation of the dark complex characters from the marvel books well written and keeps you glued to the screen from pilot to finale krysten ritter is amazing as j with purple nightmares of kill grave purple man character buildup of j is spectacular she is strong bad ass at the same time scared horrified which portrayed beautifully but david tennant as kill grave purple man stole the show he is mesmerizing his presence in the screen will scare you definitely he is the most scary super villain out there have seen all you will feel his horror all the time during the show jessica jones is darker and more dangerous than anything else marvel studios has put out to date jessica jones is also very possibly its finest most fully formed creation ', ' thought it might just start off slow like wandavision but it basically the same all the way through there no redeeming features to this poor acting poor script poor action m begrudgingly watching every episode hoping that something good might happen think there too much marvel being released and that might be why it doesn feel fresh or exciting anymore and also mainly because this show is rubbish ', ' my wife and gave it shot after loving daredevil and punisher but having no real idea about the character jessica jones very solid show dark and gritty like the other early netflix marvel shows but works different twist on the action all 3 seasons offer something different but season 1 was the strongest imo some good character arcs that are seen through pretty well if you watch all 3 seasons doubt we will see renewal of this series on disney but it feels wrapped up if it the last we see of the characters ', ' am not exactly fan of arrow gotham or flash think super hero tv series these days lack lot of maturity was expecting to the same disappointment when gave dare devil chance but surprisingly it was pretty good absolutely love the overall dark theme of the series the lines used by the characters aren all that clich either the script seems really good its not just mindless action there seems to be well organized plot the actors m quite happy with them they will surely improve and blend more with their character in the seasons to come love the drama between foggy and matt already overall think its brilliant did not feel fifty minutes pass by when watched the first episode if you look for logic and story along with action believe this is the super hero tv series you have been waiting for ', ' this was good movie enjoyed it it brought fresh breath of air to the superhero franchise took little time to develop the plot and the relationships between the characters it was worth it and nice change of pace from the other super hero movies which can although we like them can go little overboard on the non stop action ', ' script was poorly done storyline wasn that interesting the acting part so so felt like marvel franchise wants to make more profit so they keep producing these not so good quality movie ', ' it was good movie enjoyed it lot with both story wise and visual effects the acting was great too hate that haters tried to kill this movie in the beginning by giving it low rating just because she a woman and its just so stupid m 17 year old teenage boy and loved this movie not because of it being woman in the lead role but because it was an entertaining movie go watch this movie and guarantee you ll enjoy it ', ' finally watched black widow after it being out for while honestly really enjoyed it m not sure why there was so much hate sure it didn feel like typical marvel movie there wasn nearly the amount of superpowered action that we ve gotten used to it felt much more slow paced and introspective supposed then can see why it wasn maybe what people were expecting thought that the movie feeling very different actually really aided it it felt much less like superhero movie and more like fun and entertaining spy thriller the action was exciting and entertaining and aesthetically it was very enjoyable as well and think the longer periods of introspection and thoughtfulness were nice change from the usual breakneck pace of marvel movies it dealt with themes of family both who you were raised with and found family loved how instead of building up this super long detailed explicit backstory for black widow and yelena we had to figure lot of stuff out from just context clues sure there was the intro scene which thought was very well written and fittingly confusing but other than that we were left to fill in the gaps to imagine what exactly happened to natasha and co after that opening scene overall what really liked about this film was that it trusts its audience instead of having whole lot of exposition and backstory we are instead forced to consider what we know about the mcu and natasha to fill in the plot in reality this story is the climax of long story that has been natasha whole life it was definitely little slow in places and of course the villain was not that interesting that true of most mcu movies though so it to be expected at least they did good job of making him more loathsome and hateable than some other marvel villains ultimately am excited for where this movie takes the mcu hope to see more of these characters in the future this is more like 7 5 for me but rounded up ', ' black widow 2021 is not as great as other marvel movies like avengers black panther ant man etc but it is not bad too as always marvel did great job this time too and think the story was good am big marvel fan that why usually like the movies will say the same for others who are marvel fans they will also like this movie ', ' was really looking forward to watching this do not like it for the following reasons 1 clich and predictable 2 pretty agents are not experienced and just thrown into the missions 3 consistent pushed humor that is not funny gave the show chance by watching the first 3 episodes but all can say now is that there is no art to the production of this show it seems marvel is pushing too many movies and shows and it getting little old now hopefully the producers and directors go into more mature direction until then will suspend viewing it ', ' couldn sit through 5 episodes one of the boring shows ve ever seen ', ' another flat visually sub par and filler for the mcu get that they have opened for the multiverse but the character is dead they should have done this between iron man 2 and infinity war they simply don care about their characters and only do things they feel will make money regardless of quality black widow is great character that has been so mistreated ', ' black widow starts promising because it might delve into the background of the popular superheroine but that was misleading instead of formulaic origin movie black widow becomes women versus men story without decent villain and disappointing action as great as it is that female heroes get their chance to shine black widow takes this too far as this film turns into flick that is all about women fighting to escape the men who control them even the reveal of the villain taskmaster and the film conclusion is testament to the fact that black widow chooses symbolism all over the place instead of action entertainment although there is nothing wrong with deeper layer there is none of that in black widow besides the very likable florence pugh who might one day replace scarlett johansson there are no memorable characters or actors actresses in this movie not even the red guardian who brings some light moments has memorable part and the climax incl the fight scenes is forgettable that not to say black widow is bad movie the judgement is far worse black widow as movie was boring and unnecessary if you appreciate superheroine movies and you should than captain marvel is the better choice ', ' wasn holding out much hope for the marvels captain marvel was mediocre at best ms marvel was just plain terrible the bad dude in this is woman called dar benn she is possibly the worst actress have ever witnessed found it quite amusing here and there and it not as bad as thor love and thunder which is the worst marvel movie of all time but it was light on plot disjointed and just bit too silly for my liking whole family of khans in space give me break and kamala incessant fan girling was just plain annoying if she screamed hysterically once she did it hundred times just find everything about ms marvel to be irritating this movie even pushes fury character into the realms of parody which is unacceptable feel sorry for brie larsson it must be so difficult to bring anything authentic and believable to such flacid character the bit with the cats sums the marvels up for me stupid and pointless rubbish terrible plot terrible acting terrible attempts at comedy just not as bad as love and thunder or it would have had 2 as well ', ' was not big fan of superhero movies because sometimes they can really be pushed little too far and become unrealistic the avengers on the other hand was pretty amazing went to go see it 3 times with my friends and family because of its funny lines and good action sat thru this whole movie 3 times and it still kept me entertained the effects weren anything to complain about and the storyline definitely kept me interested lets hope that the new upcoming sequel will be an improvement because they really raised the bar on the avengers recommend this movie for everyone you can take your kids to go see this and they ll love it and if you take your grandparents well they might just be entertained by the cool technology they didn have in their day go check this one out guys its worth it ', ' ray winston pretending to play russian is painful to watch terrible actor and worse accent poor casting choice suprising for franchise with such huge budget stick to the gambling adverts ', ' didn expect if taskmaster was doesn important person ', ' film 8 0 rewatching the avengers m reminded just how big of deal it was when this film first brought all the heroes together four years into the marvel journey seeing them finally assemble on screen is still pretty exciting even if it not my absolute favourite of phase one the first hour of the film is what really grabs me love the way the characters interact as they meet for the first time there something fun about watching these larger than life personalities clash and try to figure each other out stark and banner in particular have great dynamic that always enjoy the expansion of shield role in the story also adds some nice layers to the film giving it more scope and sense of bigger world beyond just the superheroes that said the extended battle at the end just doesn do much for me it visually impressive sure but find myself less engaged with the non stop action it also feels like this is where the franchise starts down path of needing to constantly up the ante with bigger and bigger stakes while it exciting think it sometimes comes at the cost of more interesting character moments one thing that stands out to me even on rewatch is how much friction there is between the characters in the beginning everyone seems to be at each other throats which can be bit much at times get that it meant to build up to that big assemble moment and it does make that payoff feel earned but ve always felt the conflict was bit forced still the avengers is quite the achievement in bringing all these characters together in way that feels cohesive and fun it a solid film that still enjoy watching even if do find myself more drawn to the quieter character driven moments than the explosive action format 4k ultra hd blu ray video 9 0 upscaled 2160 24p presentation detail level good colour reproduction

presentation excellent lfe content good moofiemeter 8 0 ', ' finished watching the film about an hour ago and have to say this it is the most underwhelming of all marvel movies even when the lead actress is showing off her power which no villain in the movie even comes close to matching you feel absolutely nothing am big marvel fan and super hyped for endgame but this movie only justifies its ticket because of the two end of credits scene nothing else is memorable ', ' black widow doesn like marvel movies it has good action movie but very weak screen play assumed that movie would picture that how natasha turn to black widow but to my astonishment actually movies started within civil war script has very flat jokes like natasha father compare himself to capitan america black widow is an avenger but she looks very na ve compare to her sister the movie doesn have logical rhythm sometimes so fast and sometimes very slow it is enjoyable movie but not in th class of marvel ', ' why why why marvel did this there is sooooo much potential new stuff to show off mean we saw the natasha ability but marvel cam add even more stuff to impress the audience hook them to the movie such disappointment the story is just awful we saw those plot hundred times already just some random bad guy tries to destroy the world and mc stops them no matter what its like an apple launching same stuff for 10 years and nothing big has changed movie quality is excellent but there are some times bit cheesy acting and cgi maybe marvel wants to quickly end this madness who knows ', ' if you are fan of the punisher comics you will be very let down by this show let me say even after read some negative reviews decided to give this show try am long time fan of the comics going back to the early war journal days have to quit this show halfway through it painfully slow moving and does nothing to actually represent the punisher character from the comics the punisher isn a conflicted character he knows what he is and he embraces his mission with cold and ruthless approach was like 6 episodes in and he not in uniform yet no skull and isn out on the streets wasting scum bags that what the punisher is this show think could ve taken even more of an 80s formula with each episode stand alone as frank takes on different criminal or gang of thugs an 80s setting in new york would ve been even better don know what this show some military drama pretending to be punisher show this show had great potential and even liked the character of micro but it just such disappointment ', ' the 3 failed launch dates made this movie to be more desired than it could deliver the story of natasha pre infinity war and just after during civil war finds it pointless story that did little to fill in her backstory which was weak at best story between infinity war and endgame would have been better with no flashback scenes on natasha history the plot was more explosions and humour driven it felt more showing strong action women than having compelling story end scene is nice and leads to the next marvel series does nothing to process the mcu or the next phase of movies this movie should have been made 5 6 years ago and would have felt more in place and needed movie showing black widow after her endgame end just looses its feeling ', ' no powers from comic and can see this how the thing possible just because of fundings why no real own powers show really don like it ', ' like most cinematic productions involving military it the finest details that cause confusion officers in the marine corps do not rat good conduct medal scenes with castle in uniform he has good conduct medal wrong unless he was prior enlisted but that is to deep of plot line if only production could get clue do little research ', ' matt murdock daredevil is played by charlie cox he is really boring actor to watch he looks way too short to be daredevil there is nothing much to watch when he is on the screen most of the fights happen in the dark so it is not very exciting to watch the dark forms fighting in the dark wow never liked foggy nelson in the comic books and he is even more boring and ponderous in live action tv series add in the moping karen page played by the incredibly annoying deborah ann woll and every episode seems like it takes three hours deborah ann woll has great ability to suck everything in scene so it is about her guess that is her acting style but daredevil is not about her she is supposed to be background character who is usually acting as drag on daredevil in true blood she did the same thing she was third string character but every time she was in scene she managed to whine the loudest foggy nelson role is also way too large in this tv series elden henson has great fat face which fits the foggy nelson role perfectly in the comic books he was just around to do matt murdock work and to provide front for law office foggy used to show up in the comic books about once year not constantly daredevil is 98 talking and moping and tiny amount of action this is totally boring tv series ', ' you adapted one of the characters was most looking forward to seeing live action and you changed her whole power set to be wholly unoriginal at that point why not just make captain marvel show instead of ruining an already wildly popular character by giving her such similar powers ', ' this was again with marvel exactly what needed something different but still marvel film really like the dynamic between the characters it felt real on film level however felt misjudged the callbacks to earlier parts in the movie struck me wrong they were so emphasized that felt like the fiommakers thought was stupid no aren stupid the audience knows aside from that the film fell apart in the end bc it was too marvel you ll understand when you watch it maybe you like it didn the cast was great and their acting even better cried once so that always although always feel like the filmmakers try little to hard later in the movie had the same problem with the newer animated disney films do stil wholeheartedly recommend it ', ' closer to the bourne movies with touch of marvel ', ' from someone who is die hard mcu fan this was huge let down as most phase 4 has been first episode was alittle intriguing second less then less and less the further got never mind the power change it the mcu not supposed to be copy and paste from the comics it just never grabbed my intrest never actually finished the series because lost all intrest like historical events incorporated into movies but if heard partition one more time was going to lose it the story was just boring ', ' you don need me to tell you it the culmination of five year plan that began with samuel jackson nick fury taking tony stark aside at the end of the first iron man to tip him off as to the avengers initative there is bigger picture he told him and here it is the be all but not they re hoping the end all of the current craze for cgi enhanced super heroics interspersing flip one liners with host of larger than life characters and the usual flurry of fight and flight scenes the film is never less than amusing still it never more than amusing either marvel studios has made it point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the dc warner bros batman films the lightness is fun but it doesn offer much of foundation on which to build an epic and let face it there more than whiff of opportunism about project that pits defrosted world war ii hero captain america chris evans an inventor industrialist iron man robert downey jr the pagan lightning god thor chris hemsworth scientist with anger management issues hulk mark ruffalo and shield agents black widow scarlett johansson and hawkeye jeremy renner against the norse god of mischief loki tom hiddleston and legion of marauding aliens in 3 meet the boss of the avengers chris hemsworth is thor chatting with the iron man 2 cast still whedon who shares screenplay credit with zak penn is very sharp operator he knows which buttons to press and where there room for little diversion the improbability of this misfit coalition becomes the movie most rewarding asset imagine the bristling egos of so many power players cooped up in the same room the movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand offs not surprisingly robert downey jr flip cynical stark iron man gets good measure of the movie best lines bouncing off steve rogers captain america boy scout idealism and thor guileless sledgehammer style sometimes literally whedon also crafts couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for scarlett johansson black widow far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in iron man 2 great action 3d is the best up till now robert downey jr is hilarious is the glue that holds the movie together hulk come in last but is the best in the movie ', ' while it may not be like the other marvel superhero movies about tough guy saving the world it refreshing to see teen brown girl navigating her way through life with the addition of having superpower remember not every hero needs to speak to the same audience we are in time of embracing diversity so embrace it ', ' no spoilers hey guys this is my 1st review ever but couldn control myself to review about this movie just simply loved it just watched it today in 2d just loved loved loved it mean iron man robert downey jr and hulk were just despicable there comic timing there action sequences were just awesome m gonna go watch this movie again this week highly recommend this movie for everyone not just for kids but also for adults at 1st thought this movie was just normal super hero flick but nops its something beyond that mean awesome sound effects gr8 comic timings and moreover great story to compliment everything so 10 stars for this movie from me and also don wanna compare it with batman or dark knight because its different and better in its own way no spoilers ', ' positives after 2 years we finally got new mcu movie and overall it a good movie it has its flaws and it didn meet my expectations mostly it works and it feels like something that disney produced and that could be even good or bad thing the strongest positive of the movie it the cast think the chemistry everyone had was excellent it seemed that you ve seen them interact before by far florence pugh was the best one might have fallen in love with her this is something that disney does most of the time hire good actors that will have good relationship with the fans in the future not only the chemistry the acting was truly good better than in some other mcu movies most of the characters are pretty good loved yelena and alexei they were extremely funny and didn feel forced m truly hyped to see more of yelena in the future the rest of the characters were good would ve liked to see more from melina and even natasha didn feel closure for natahsa character and all she represented for the mcu in previous movies the action is excellent there is no doubt that action scenes in marvel have been improving with the years to point that they became this epic and badass the incredible action is thanks to beautiful visual effects didn see many scenes where the cgi failed it felt like john wick movie but with even more fantastic and unreal action which love loved the tone of the movie mystery and spy movie about natasha escaping which connects with her past and vengeance to be completed and allows us to meet new characters from her story characters that we ll see in the future and will be filling the hole that the ending of scarlett character left on lot of fans something liked was the way they connect it with movies like civil war without feeling forced or the introduction of new characters without feeling like they could and should have appeared before liked the comedy of the movie had an actual laugh at some parts of the movie let say that only 15 of the jokes felt forced florence pugh was o t loved his character and his performance she made me laugh lot and without her this movie would easily be 5 out of 10 the post credit scene was the best part of the movie it connects with other disney shows and it opens world of possibilities really want to see how it ll be handled and what direction will be taken really liked lorne balfe soundtrack loved him in i fallout and he killed it for black widow negatives black widow is not even close to being perfect it has lot of flaws that are common in most mcu movies my biggest problem with the movie is the villain dreykov reminds me of the first mcu villains generic boring uninteresting stupid and normal didn like him at all and it probably because it a vengeance story which it truly personal for natasha character but just got to know this important part of her life plus the villain appears for no more than 15 minutes also taskmaster was amazingly wasted why couldn they go with the original story of tony masters and use him in the future to fight other heroes because don see this character fighting spiderman this taskmaster has no personality and lacks one of his best things which is his narcissism and his pride he was pretty menacing until the big reveal it was pretty predictable and the plot twists were meh the only two liked were the post credit scene and one more but the rest were unnecessary and too elaborated keep thinking that this movie should ve been made and presented before infinity war knowing how the character future ends makes you not worry about her and just focus on the rest few plot holes that luckily weren important conclusion really liked black widow think it a product that works and is successful in what they want which is to introduce you to new characters that will participate in the future and will have bigger role the action was excellent and the style of the movie making it seem like jason bourne movie was pretty good the cast did great job and would love to see them again in the future it fails in the villain aspect but at least that wasn the focus there is villain because it a superhero movie and then there are the normal errors like some plot holes and how predictable it is it a movie that recommend but would say that if you are true fan of natasha you should watch it with low expectations because if not you could dislike how the spotlight was focussed to the other characters would say that black widow is john wick movie with steroids ', ' the daredevil was an unexpectedly good series from evil that had some excellent character building my favorite character was wilson fisk which was played marvelously by vincent onoforio my second favorite was of course the daredevil himself this was also portrayed quite well by charlie cox he tried and failed to give good performance when he had to interact with deborah ann woll and or elden henson could tolerate elden henson although just barely who probably around for some light comic relief if at all but his acting was weak and there was not much chemistry between these two supposed best buds of so many years the worst part of the series was deborah ann woll her acting was simply horrible it simply dragged the whole series down towards the end wish could just skip the parts in which she was in will not include any spoilers but you will understand my pain when you have to go through the scenes of her alcoholism if those two actors were better casted this show would have been sure 9 series ', ' this was my favorite tv show until they added all the sex scenes ', ' last night watched the most anticipated movie the avengers movie is about group of superheroes fighting war raged by loki and his alien army movie is entertaining which will keep you to the seat to last minute director joss whedon has done awesome job cgi effects are better than transformers selection of superheroes is almost perfect although there is little problem they should have selected peter parker spider man instead of natasha romanoff black widow black widow looks out of space through out the movie and also iam very disappointed by captain america costume it looks very cheap and old fashioned not to mention clint barton hawkeye his acting is good but where he gets unlimited arrows from credit goes to making this movie success and entertaining to mark ruffalo as dr bruce banner hulk tom hiddleston as loki tony stark iron man final words any fantasy action movie lover should not miss this flick ', ' enjoyed the series however there were some poor casting issues distinctly didn like the the role of electra poor acting with unrealistic scenes the rest couldn get enough of especially the role of punisher well done with great acting ', ' loved this movie so much carol danvers is my favorite marvel hero and loved brie acting she is funny and does have character growth but she is more like british actor in that she is subtle rather than outlandish ', ' as man who loves breasts am served the action is also great the rolling art at the ending is definitevely one of the greatest ever seen cheers ', ' its hit must watch nice storyline good acting ', ' it seems like it was conceived from script to filming as mini series and then they had to convert it to feature film for some reason and so they do pretty terrible but unavoidably doomed work at the edition room and that what you sadly see lot of material undeveloped and compressed in production budget tone level sensible for series but not for theater maybe they even did it on purpose so at least some audience were able to realize that this was not the story they were initially payed to tell that would explain the constant impression of an unfinished draft who knows also it requires from you to have seen the related series previously in order to not be utterly lost in the many characters stories ', ' groan find this movie dull tedious and boring it just doesn work on any level let start with the hero for start there too many their characters only get enough screen time to be show in one shade all exempt iron man who is show to be like god or something and that is daft the story itself makes no sense and gives the feeling that they were making it up as they went the visuals are ok but nothing to shout about the comedy kinda works but after you seen it once it tends to drag it feels like they were trying to be funny instead of it being naturally funny the avengers is the perfect example of directors thinking about money by pandering to those who have an iq in single figures and an explosion fetish instead of thinking about the art of creating good movie would have given this film one star but it does have one saving grace or rather three the strong acting from hulk loki and captain america drag this movie though by the scruff of its neck overall poor film ', ' don get the raving about the acting jon bernthal doesn do much for me in this role could not stand seeing the stupid and completely annoying flashbacks of his lame wife in almost every episode this is really violent very unrealistic get this is based on comic but seriously no one can sustain the levels of beatings abuse and tedious there is lot of bashing the nra making soldiers look unbalanced and the military corrupt and overall they did in 13 episodes what could have been done in half the episodes just repeating the same match ups on new day people get shot in the head and wake up fine everyone gets beaten senseless several times with minimal down time relationships really aren developed or sensical you know how it is going to end up so it is really just matter of putting in the time to get there sad what people think is great tv today ', ' hollywood never does it this well being south asian and pakistani was giddy watching all the episodes glad that the cast was actually pakistani the culture was accurately represented the songs are bangers and kamala story is really well represented as muslim south asian superhero can wait for the final episode and more from this character ', ' it was absolutely awful my mate walked out after half hour was embarrassed and watched it until about an hour in then couldn take it anymore it truly terrible lol ', ' will try to review this in plain english language without using any clever words m 30min into the movie and struggling to continue watching it mainly because can seem to undesrtand the point of this movie or what was the reason this movie was made the only explanation was able to come up so far is like imagine you are watching the avengers then tony stark goes to the toilet to do number 2 as result he absent from the movie for about 10min producers oh let make 2 hour movie about that ', ' the reception of this third season has been overwhelming and hate to be the one to put but and it is possible that the problem has more than the series as such at the time enjoyed the first and second season but since then 2016 my eyes have gone through great variety of series and movies the main problem is that 13 chapters of 50 minutes are too many it is noted especially in the script and in the budget the series it is not that it is different from the previous ones but for me in this golden age of series there should be more cinematographic and less televised contribution know it sounds very strong but it how feel it but back to what works very well in the series his characters have always been very well built especially wilson fisk who returns this season the story is good maybe the best more mundane and personal moving away from the second season it is based on born again the most important comic of the hero here again see problems not because it is more or less faithful to the original that it is as long as the themes and developments are very similar if not because the visual proposal is quite scarce mean that everything ends up expressing with words leaving little space for the visual removing some unnecessary flashbacks do not want to leave him with this bitter impression in the television format it is very good series ', ' so recently watched this film again on dvd the other day and can safely say this is without doubt one of the best superhero films we ve had in the past decade not only is it great way to wrap up phase one of the mcu but it stands as an important masterpiece for the other films what would eventually come in the years after 2012 m not going to spoil anything here but this movie is worth the watch enjoy the fight scenes between characters the soundtrack is amazing yet catchy and the cast is pretty good too if you are marvel fan grew up with the comics or just looking for an action film to watch this one is right up your street ', ' what hero daredevil is and what person and actor matthew murdock is but great villains make great heroes so credit where credit is due bullseye and kingpin top notch foes actually didn expect bullseye to be such great and powerful enemy second tier mini boss at best had such huge impact on this season with great combat skills and impressive fighting sequences but the person pointdexter has also great depth and keeps the viewers interest at all times fisk turning full kingpin was also nice delivered can remember low point in the season well maybe the filler karen episode but even this was good for its intriguing backstory the series keeps it dark and serious tone throughout its progression but without getting boring just for the sake of it this season also had the best fighting scenes mean some of the were just awsome the prison one shot scene exceptional as was the finale with the triple threat going on surely fisk was the final boss but it didn feel like it as it felt shared between them both not one character had bad performance next season would like for new villains to be introduced and dd showed us that when one hero show is cancelled after another he is getting just better and better at captivating the audience maybe the rest of the team would be better in one show team up dd could show up there too also he totally deserves to get an appearance in mcu movie if not avengers 10 10 ', ' the movie is complete entertainer what dc has created with justice league marvel has answered with avengers though wolverine is to be part of marvel world as he has complete movie franchise at his disposal we do not get to see him here the bunch of characters assembled for the group or rather force are so conflicting yet they perform good enough in the movie the sfx in the movie are good and not sketchy the character development is good especially of iron man and captain america the constant tiff happening between them reminds of batman supermen ego battles the sequel is about to come guessing by the scenes after titles the 3d is better than the last 3d movie personally liked the characters of tony stark captain america and bruce banner yes the hulk his comments in rage are comic as they are meant to be ', ' spoilers ahead let me preface it by saying have never been fan of the marvel comics and only found couple of the set up movies to be decent however was still intrigued because of the very good reviews from critics and the box office success after watching this is not what would consider good film it basically on par or slightly above michael bay transformers series and anyone who has read my reviews of those knows how low think of them even the best the original is really only average avengers is pretty well made decently well acted and slickly produced but it just doesn have good story and the premise is basically absurd first the villain is nothing special loki motives are vague his plan confusing at best and at no point is his character even that menacing right from the start you know that thor or iron man or hulk could kick the crap out of him so there never any suspense as to whether loki would succeed second all the science and techno talk throughout makes little sense and is very difficult to follow found myself not caring about iron man and bruce banner supposed genius after while the script is just soooo formulaic you know the heroes will have personality clash at first you know there will be sombering event that will pull them all together and you know they will prevail this has been done million times in these movies and to be honest it been done way better what is even the point of the scarlet johansen and jeremy renner characters they re human and their abilities are really impossible to even believe same with their effectiveness when fighting the final battle in reality they have been killed in like 2 seconds like any other human fighting in battle of immortals renner acting was also pretty bad same with chris evans captain america was just wooden character and for movie that was praised for clever script and lot of humor laughed only handful of times even robert downey jr alleged wit got annoying and like said no suspense in the final battle the alien army that had been built up throughout turns out to be very easily defeatable these guys get killed like nothing and don even appear to have any special powers their forces turn out to be quite light as well besides hulk and thor are basically portrayed as immortal same as iron man when he is in the suit which has every magical ability under the sun so there is zero suspense because no one watching could ever believe for second that any of these 3 could actually be defeated or killed the way iron man blows up their big ship is ripoff of independence day anyway and of course he lives once again zero suspense as to whether he would make it it just poor film making and really micahel bay could have made this movie especially the final battle that basically what it is overall you have to be huge fanboy of the comics to think this is great movie it really not plus at 2 hours and 20 minutes it drags and drags and is tough watch very disappointed overall not recommended 4 10 ', ' this just after one viewing is one of my favorite marvel movies the action and fight scenes were really well done quite few times it reminded me of how the bourne series was shot marvel takes dark turn with this story it probably the most realistically violent in the entire series there is lot of blood and broken bones which doesn mean it skimps on the humor dave harbour and florence puge are the stand out new additions in this scarlett really has embodied natasha and goes out on high ', ' its slow boring as hell her powers are so boring never thought would have to say this type of review for marvel series actors are not good at all overall dont waste your time watching this watch the boys or star wars ', ' this movie has me wondering if it is me and not the movie the characters are ok performances fine and action sequences are competent yet it felt like drag to watch all these unfold everything feels repetitive and derivative of other marvel movies and that what makes me wonder if by now these superhero movies have been just too much of good thing all set pieces we have seen before and there is not one element or character that does not have an almost exact counterpart in previous marvel movie and maybe that is what we are supposed to get right the same thing we love over and over again then maybe it is not you marvel it is me it is me the one that feels that has to move on because don think can take any more of this kind of movie it has been too much of the same good or bad no longer matters just think need to see other movies ', ' 1 poor direction 2 bad dialogue 3 bad star casting there acting is not natural all overacting many time skip skip and stop only marvel namae no quality ', ' after very long time we finally got chance to watch new marvel movie really missed watching one of marvel good superhero movies especially hero from the original six who we haven seen its film yet however had lost interest in the movie because of the long break and did not have many expectations thought that it would be classic and average marvel movie unfortunately the film was even less than expected if we divide the movie into two halves would say that the first half satisfied me even though there were still things that didn like as whole which will come back to them the first half of the movie had clear story and goal taskmaster was also looking cool and scary it reminded me of the wintersoldier it was what define as classic marvel movie on the other hand the second half of the movie lost its focus many weird things start to happen one after the other there were moments for example the flashbacks of the original plan that felt very cliche the taskmaster also turned out to be not the guy many of us thought now let talk about the things that did not like in general think the movie failed to introduce the main bad guy of the film dreykov and the story of blackwidow as told you liked the first half nevertheless these things troubled me mainly in the first half the film has brief scenes that are about the past of blackwidow and dreykov flashbacks that are like maximum of 5 minutes believe that it does not give us the necessary back story of the red room and because the film revolves around those lacked scenes just started to not give damn about what they were talking about and what was happening towards the end in my opinion the main reason behind this is that they focused on yelena and that family issue more than blackwidow itself think they could have reduced some of the dialogue scenes to show us more flashbacks but still it wouldn be enough it would be much better if they just focused on blackwidow and the redroom also think that natasha is not the same person that we know from the other movies believe the reason for this is also because the film is not focused on her in addition it would be cooler if taskmaster was the master of the redroom and the main villain of the movie normally would have given 5 5 but there isn such an option and because of my respect for marvel itself will give 6 ', ' why are there so many poor reviews for this movie thought it was lovely ', ' it started out in the first few episodes as promising heroine with superpowers vs more evil person with different empowerment but soon started to fall to the cheap and stupidly thought out tv created serials you see being mass produced today if you re going to have an everyday human with special whatevers make it plausible to an eighth grader at least first plot get the tiresome series of hero mistakes to continue the series for at least twelve episodes in this case not only does our female heroine keep making the same mistakes over over but people continue to die though out also subplots of stereotypic flawed lawyer flawed parents flawed cops etc second worse still she is super flawed and selfish which doesn help the viewer be on her side her adversary who enjoys killing for sport with his super control actually at times comes across as more understandable likable third heroine has super strength and jumps high but it never clearly explained how acquired anyway besides the two gifts having no connection our physically skinny thus not believable heroine though out shows major inconsistencies in her application of these super skills as for our evil super person he controls people minds but not clear if it telepathic or he has to verbally instruct the later seems to be the case so the solution is wear ear plugs or play loud music etc also didn make high school basic biological sense that his skill is because he was given virus fourth cheap cinematographic tricks of camera showing only little of super skill g heroine lifts car but you only see back of car heroine jumps really high but you only see feet going up and not the tethered line lots and lots of tossing people things another cheap camera angle trick which got really boring fifth seems as if producers borrowed the highly successful regarded rooney mara salander look feel for ms jones conclusion show has promise if they invest more in props cgi hire some intelligent writers think outside the box enroll in middle school science classes ', ' judging from this movie reception we could easily conclude that this is one of the best comic book movies ever but truth be told it is pretty generic movie it has all the favorite clich the evil that will destroy the world we have typical jerk hero transformation with pseudo sacrifice and all the others unpredictable character evolutions would call it well crafted movie action scenes are good dialog can be fun sometimes and the acting is nice it just brings nothing new to the table and it is one of those movies that you will watch and then remember couple of scenes lines from it and later on you ll just remember warm fuzzy feeling that it left in you so it is worth to check it out final verdict it is not groundbreaking but it is an entertaining movie so check it out ', ' reviews you can see the same thing at the end of the incredible hulk then why to add this at all simply waste of time and energy if you are re watching this series then you can skip it as you would have already seen it ', ' many shows start go down after 3 season however daredevil definitely not one of those shows daredevil like many other netflix shows has great quality until today all those marvel tv shows daredevil should be the best ', ' gets two stars for two reasons costumes are good if gave it one star would be called out for review bombing and names lot of them that about it it almost as watching darker version of the power rangers ', ' beautifully crafted masterpiece stellar mcu debut by brie larson fascinating and creative origin story for the mcu as it stands today surprising twists and turns on classic stories and characters highly recommend ', ' this film was ok in way that it had decent entry in the story behind the character however the movie was not as good as had originally anticipated it basically bath of cgi and fancy stunts but there is very little plot and the villain of the movie is rarely in it get the impression marvel didn really want to make this movie and saw it as throw away movie it sure seems like it ', ' short summation the first season is the best the second is slightly less so but the third is scatter shot mess do you remember when they used to be able to simulate night scenes in movies yet you could still see everything that was going on not so here if you are among the legion of fans that hated the game of thrones episode the long night you ll hate the third season for the same reason everything is too dark to see fight scenes become nothing more than glints of light and sound effects after awhile it just gets tiresome add to that number of flashbacks that eat up time yet can be covered in few lines of dialogue and you have frustrating experience ', ' my family has been fan of the comics since day one this show took it to the next level with amazing cast and fun take on the character hope we get to see more of kamala in the mcu ', ' was new to series world other than game of thrones my friend suggested me the punisher it was really awesome experience and became fan of character named karen page she was full of mysteries so just started complete marvel series started with daredevil season 1 still not fan of ideology of matt murdock still he is ok season 2 was damn awesome for punisher fan lime me ', ' have always loved the punisher comics but the film never did them justice when the series first came along was worried it would be as weak as netflix other marvel offerings but it proved me wrong the series is gritty and adrenaline pumping while giving decent back story to the characters my only minor complaints are the some times slow pace of scenes there are plenty where you can skip 30 seconds and loose nothing while improving on the pace and secondly how unlikable midani and amy are would have had no issue if neither of them were even in the story lines roll on series 3 ', ' marvel give us cool fun movie with great storyline there is line that continue to the all movie the acting is amazing the cast is brilliant watched the movie at home with great sound system think it also fun movie for the theaters ', ' loved the first episode and am hoping to see more don understand what up with all the hate in regards to her religion and this shows that the target audience is exaggerated when you hear that it for kids 10 years or younger ', ' this show is definitely worth checking out and is solid addition to the marvel universe it definitely ties into the movies like thor captain america the avengers etc and its really interesting to see the side effects and aftermath of the events that happened in the movies happen on this show will say that it does start off slow and weak the acting isn the strongest the dialogue is pretty bad and cheesy at times and the plot is bit slow and all over the place however once you reach to the captain america episode which believe is at season 1 episode 15 or so the show definitely picks up by lot the action is great there a lot of drama and its very tense haven started season 2 yet but from what ve heard its definitely improved lot over season 1 so m excited to see it don write off this show from the initial impressions give it time and m certain you will enjoy it edit just changed my rating from 9 to 10 have caught up and watched season 2 and it is by far leaps and bounds better than season 1 unlike season 1 all the characters are finally getting fleshed out the action is all fast and immediate unlike season 1 where things happened slowly the plot is keeping me intrigued and really can wait for the next episode just watched the midseason finale and it was absolutely amazing there was huge reveal and major tie in to future marvel movie quite possibly one of the biggest things to happen to the marvel universe and am truly excited to see where it goes ', ' new opening scene tribute to passing of stand lee this is so emotional captain marvel is claimed to be the strongest marvel hero but m not so sure that captain marvel stronger than thor or thanos however m absolutely sure that xat slave would enjoy to watch this movie ', ' is it better than captain marvel absolutely but that as far as can go when it comes to praise for this pile of dog sh that might have been ok as phase 1 movie in fact we were asking for black widow movie back then but nope we had iron man 2 the rushed mini avengers movie and the 2nd box office flop in the mcu after the 1st flop in the franchise the incredible hulk and even that film is better than this junk is the movie ok yeah if your drunk ', ' have no idea how joss whedon has made this film work not only does this work but this is one of the best superhero films ve ever seen surprisingly the script isn as biased towards iron man as thought it would be and every character gets good amount of screen time and their chance to shine black widow and hawkeye more than hold their own and they aren just in the background whilst the other superheroes dominate the screen and have all the action widow and hawkeye do some unbelievably awesome things and are crucial to the story the dialogue is consistently witty and hilarious every character gets to deliver good punchline before the film is up the final battle in manhattan lasts good half an hour at least and didn want it to end the action was of an epic scope and was absolutely jaw dropping but the real surprise and best part of this film by far is the hulk after 2 so so films they finally got the hulk right and dare say it he my favourite avenger after this and this will probably be the case for most of you when you leave the theatre this film was action packed but it wasn transformers this film had heart intelligent dialogue and cast of brilliant actors playing conflicting egos and colourful characters every actor is spot on in their respective roles tom hiddleston makes for an excellent villain playing loki thor brother and robert downey jr is much better here than he was in iron man 2 the only problem really had with it was that in the middle it dragged on ever so slightly but this was forgotten by the time the credits rolled it has to be said though if you haven seen any of the marvel films before this you won have any idea what going on and you probably won really care for the film until the last hour or so kicks in make sure you stay through the end credits it not over just yet ', ' which is kinda wrong because the films isn all bad the action is well its cut paste from all the other cut paste marvel superhero films but its the storyline puns one liners obscure casting thats just so dire ok the storyline starts off quite logically for marvel sidestep and pick up on another character development milk the franchise even more plot there the predictability of good against bad but somewhere in this covid dictated film m reckoning the original actors couldn make it nor the director nor the screen writer because you can actually see where the producer went oh hell phone up whats his face he ll do it as the film goes spiralling into someone else dream reality the one liners oh my god if tony stark was real person and he wasn dead or is he he be sueing the film makers for copy write on his character trait ray winstons russian accent well it just isn the family reunion scene is by far the biggest clue that taking unprescribed drugs whilst making film is not good idea it so far out their it ll probably end up with its on reality tv show actually got extremely angry the first attempt at watching this film because it just confused the gotta me had to walk away before plucked my own eyes out second attempt and some calm me down drugs made it to the action packed completely implausible yet predictable end watching this film is like eating well known burger it looks sooo good in the adverts even the wrapper is inviting but when you start chomping into it its just the same old minced up meat with little or no valuable contents but it ll do till you get proper meal ', ' maybe was expecting to much from this series ve watched 2 episodes and the acting his horrible jon bernthal is by far the wrong actor for such an iconic marvel character he opens his mouth and that fake raspy voice he has makes me wanna fast forward through any scene he in and that nose they couldn find someone with smaller nose horrible series disservice to the comics ', ' an interesting concept and it kept my attention until the third episode when realized the punisher was whispering all of his lines know this is technique that actors and directors seem to think adds emotion but to me all it does it seem fake and unreal people do not go around whispering in real life ', ' it absolutely made for teens so understand why some adults aren feeling it but think it brilliant think the actress playing kamala is natural ', ' the idea of taskmaster as villain is an interesting concept but here it translated into what felt like lazy filmmaking most of the action scenes with taskmaster seemed copied and pasted from other marvel films and fell flat for me was never really bored but the plot twists were predictable character development seemed forced and there was some laughable cgi and plot holes worth watch it ll keep you entertained but feel like it didn do black widow the justice she deserved ', ' if could rate this movie higher would have never sat down to rate movie ever so well done to the entire cast and team very good job done have never been into marvel and my introduction to the world of marvel was iron man and the hulk some few years back yet this movie has made me want to look for these comics and read them care was taken in developing this work and it shows the dialogue was witty action was great amazing how they all work so well together in the movie beautifully produced already want to see it again can say though for cineworld milton keynes 3d was not too fab if you are seeing in 3d the action scenes are where 3d works best all other normal dialogue scenes are clearer with the 3d glasses off so there you are what are you waiting for go see this movie well worth every last penny by the way did mention couple of hot sexy guys wink ', ' you re larger than life you have abilities beyond that of most human beings on the planet then the world finds itself in peril and to save it you ll need to join group of people just as unique as you if not more so what do you do h e d agent nick fury played by samuel jackson is overseeing top secret project designed to study an energy source from another world known as the tesseract the experiment soon goes awry and the tesseract appears to explode in actuality it has opened portal allowing the malevolent being known as loki played by tom hiddleston to emerge it almost immediately clear that h e d is outmatched and what worse the supervisor of the tesseract project dr erik selvig played by stellan skarsgard and experienced covert agent nicknamed hawkeye played by jeremy renner became mindless drones under loki hiddleston command once the facility is destroyed and the invaders have moved on fury jackson calls agent natasha romanoff also known as the black widow scarlet johansson to recruit one member of the avengers the avengers initiative was abandoned some time before the events depicted in this film but is reactivated for the sake of mankind and for lack of better alternative romanoff johansson is next seen in india resorting to subterfuge to gain audience with bruce banner played by mark ruffalo banner ruffalo has gone into hiding to escape opportunists in the american government to remain calm to spare the world and those around him any damage he might inflict as the hulk next to be approached by h e d is iron man tony stark played by robert downey jr in the character third major film the last member left to recruit is steve rogers played by chris evans more commonly known as captain america when they re finally brought together banner and stark are tasked with tracing the energy source and in so doing locating the enemy when that accomplished they meet yet another traveler from worlds beyond thor played by chris hemsworth loki brother now was not really fan of captain america the first avenger nor was altogether pleased after seeing thor as for bruce banner larger half perhaps it impossible to make film about the incredible hulk that wouldn like first there was the ang lee eric bana film then the edward norton film both of which enjoyed still did like ruffalo also thor captain america and the black widow made individual contributions to enrich the story hiddleston may not be as physically imposing as chris hemsworth but as an egomaniacal extraterrestrial he is truly terrifying can comment on whether the 3 effects added anything as saw it in 2 but regardless the avengers was incredible the one thing might say was lacking was iron man best friend james rhodes wearing an armored flight suit of his own and going by the name war machine we caught glimpse of that suit in action in iron man 2 but it was nowhere to be seen here and thought the film was worse off for it still very exciting highly entertaining and one great ride see it ', ' there is rumor going round that this show has high rating here like this because the ratings were paid for wouldn be surprised if that were the case don know about the paid raters but how can normal raters give this show even more than 2 stars some viewers raters are sooo tasteless this show lack taste there is no thrill to it at all it is build around several sex scenes the plot is all messed up with high school writing in summary the whole thing is about the main char woman meeting guy and playing romance with him episode after episode in fact there was one episode which had about three sex scenes between this woman and her boyfriend as if that is not enough we also have several sex scene between her best friend and her boyfriend the most annoying part of it all is after enduring an episode of clueless 30 minutes plot and 10 minutes of sex scenes you are served with the most agitating and boring action of modern day tv in the last 5 minutes the creator of this show thinks all viewers are dumb and don think when they watch movies my advice stay away from this unless you want show which is unintelligent has clueless plot full of soft porn and all round lacking any thrill turn to the blacklist if you haven already ', ' such poor film best avoided m afraid adds nothing to the franchise no story to talk of must confess do not like films with established characters that go back in time to tell back story like solo there is no jeopardy in that you know the main character will come to no harm ', ' do not have to say anything just this is the real punisher there is nothing to think just watch and enjoy ', ' wow too many people share their opinions with out even seeing the full series reviews where people admit to not having watched the entire show should be omitted from the ratings average imo jere zebela should not be able to review anything on imdb or be able to type their word garbage on any public forum nearly all their reviews are either 1 10 or 10 10 that ridiculous my turn daredevil is great series it not perfect but still very good most of the acting is great and some of the fight sequences are incredible think it gives perfect blend of action and drama by the end of season 3 was emotionally invested in some of the characters plights and it made some scenes all the more powerful there are some slow parts with lot of dialogue but really didn feel like they took away from the story or the pace many characters go through some sort of transition and think that the journeys are believable and maybe even relatabe to some maybe this was inspired by nolan batman trilogy but is that bad thing the dark knight is one of my favorite movies of all time love the darker more realistic approach to the superhero genre read somewhere that disney is picking this show up as much as would love to see the story continued have terrible feeling about this ', ' am not big fan of the superhero movies but find this series to be a pleasant surprise the young actress iman vellani is magnificent as the young girl who is superfan of captain marvel also love the production design with the animation and cool graphics know hard core fans will brush this off as kids show but think we need some younger superheroes nowadays ', ' david tennant is incredible aside from that this show really isn worth watching make purple man show where it just him being real lunatic 10 10 would watch not jessica jones though skip ignore most of jessica jones season 1 episodes 4 12 is the only acceptable viewing pattern no appearance of iron fist too which is bonus ', ' captain marvel non spoiler review 1 the good there were many great moments in this movie moments where long time mcu fans will really enjoy most of the mcu questions and plot holes will be cleared in this movie the supporting cast all of them were very good the best character in the movie by far is ben mendelsohn talos mean come on its ben mendelsohn my second favourite was nick fury man did samuel jackson shined as hell in this movie brie larson will be my third favourite though aside from the second act she was so powerful menacing and fun to watch the mid credit scene was so awesome and the end credits was not great but fun to watch also loved what this movie has added to the overall mcu history oh yeah goose the cat was awesome too 2 the bad brie larson as captain marvel was up and down for me though sadly she was very good in the first and last act but in the middle act especially on earth her character for some reason was acting kind of dull but there is still lots of movies where she can improve just like how chris hemsworth thor took 4 5 movies later to grow on me in thor ragnarok was where started loving him also wished the kree soldiers starforce members had more screentime and character development most of the starforce members role were very small also the colour grading for this movie was very awful some of the scenes were very difficult to see the scenes were very dark rusty and brownish the pacing in this movie at some parts were very slow as well but get it as it needs to explain lot to the audience the action scenes were just ok as well was hoping for them to be unique and entertaining but they were just ok and above average if you are cgi nerd like me and you want every cgi scenes to look great and believable well some cgi in the third act the ones on captain marvel when she flies are bit game like but they arent awful or very obvious also wished they developed the relationship between maria and carol even more but what got was fine and not that bad my last criticism would be that there was song that was played in the third act the scene where the song drops felt very rushed and out of place for me mcu movie ranking 14th place out of 21 so overall rating 7 8 10 imdb score 8 10 ', ' as family and huge marvel fans we hated 97 7 of this movie as mom found it actually desturbing how they portray girl trade the story try to create connection with whistle and few fireflies but in my opinion total miss love you scarlett m sorry for the bad review ', ' review of season 1 good lead actor but the stallone style grunting annoyed me at times fairly predictible and too drawn out could have been 3 or 4 episodes shorter m 47 amd still marvel fan but this may be better for younger audience ', ' sad as in the people doing it are sad ms marvel is one of the best comics ve ever read the avengers game with her as the protagonist main narrative was the one saving grace of that game this show combines the two stories so far in rather interesting way the cast is good the acting fine the pacing is good heaven forbid we get newer marvel character and fleshed out origin story everything about this is great so far ', ' with all the hype created the punisher will test your patients its slow and very very slow in parts there are so many scenes which can be deleted nothing much happens in single episode mean the staory of one season is only good enough for 2 3 episodes its like skyfall of bond movies no goosebumps no character development don believe good reviews stating it as action series there is nothing new in the show which you haven watched before watch at your own risk ', ' great movie you don need strong villain this movie is what it is supposed to be ignore the bad comment and rating below these guys expect lot and gets disappointed ad gives bad review this is just movie to know how strong and powerful captain marvel is this is released before since she is part of avenger endgame she looks good as captain marvel and don know why some idiots compare this character with wonder women ', ' maybe am getting old but having comic relief moments every 5 minutes is not my thing only good thing about this show is its getting better slowly but surely maybe my main problem is the shows pg rating firefly had rating of tv 14 and completely different feel of comical relief moments you felt like you caught the characters being childish not that they are childish on purpose the science duo fitz and simmons dialogs annoy the hell out of me its like watching 12 year old on steroids sometimes anyway with the childish comical over the top acting scenes the shows loses my interest at times completely so at the end have to say am disappointed at what came out of the most expected show of 2013 basically if this was tv 14 or higher rated show this could have easily been one of my top shows of 2013 now its just something check if its getting any better it is but not by much ', ' this used to be good show then came 2019 testament to the idea you need to know when to stop the show has descended into an appalling bad writing bad plot just pathetic half hearted sloppy effort to continue for show that used to have craftsmanship and soul now it is soulless and hack job why on earth joss whedon and the 2 other show creators didn cancel the show while they were ahead do not know it time for this sad hack job to come to an end please put the show out of it misery that way it may retain some of it former dignity ', ' just got out of the theater few hours ago some say saying this is not good movie even one reviewer on youtube said this the worst mcu film ever is it perfect film no there are few small things its little uneven at times however feel the relationship the chemistry between captain marvel miss marvel and monica is one of the strongest points of the film in my mind iman vellani as miss marvel is in my mind one of the best additions to the mcu in recent years she is full of such loveable charm charisma and genuine spark of radiant innocence along with so much heart and warmth to her character you want to see more of her in other projects larson carol danvers captain marvel seems to get more layers to her character here more emotional depth than that been shown before think the villain is very one note honestly she in my mind not truly evil she is just trying to do certain thing to help her people from the planet she lives on and the way she is going about is questionable nick furry is interesting to be shown in more of jokey way he really doesn have much to do lady playing monica thought did pretty well as said before to me the strongest part of the movie is the three main ladies playing miss marvel captain marvel and monica rambeau their interactions their back and forth their chemistry together feel is the best part of the movie feel if you go watch movie in the theater and enjoy it have good time watching it that what counts some things in the marvels may not work for some people or some jokes may not land or some parts may not work for some people but thats ok ', ' okay let get straight into the point this film lacks tension characterization genuineness well these three elements are often interconnected as good characterization leads to sincerity genuineness leads you the viewer to care for the story and the characters therefore creating tension it all loop sic mundus creatus est anyway captain marvel failed at all three which is not good sign characterization is one of the most criticized aspects of this film captain marvel was sloppily written as we don feel anything for her not single thing first off they made her far too perfect as if she some goddess from an ancient myth she has no conflict external or internal can she lose no can she fear no does she even has flaw nope as result her character feels unrelatable and eventually bland and boring there barely any tension in this film for couple of reasons the bad characterization definitely isn helping but the main problem is the fact that the film never tries to up its stakes the characters are always in control they re always confident the villain is always losing these are the kind of things that really really kill the tension in the air by sucking it out with vacuum cleaner the film does try to create some alright little tension by giving the protagonist amnesia unfortunately it doesn quite work thanks to one this method is overused and two it fails to have an impact on the character as hoped finally this film is not genuine it feels superficial in many aspects which include the character arcs the storyline the visuals everything which is direct repercussion of the issues mentioned above overall the film remains enjoyable for those who don mind the problems mentioned above brie larson and samuel jackson have good chemistry with each other and the visuals are neatly done unfortunately this doesn change the fact that this film is far too flawed and can be considered as weaker entry into the mcu ', ' of all the newest marvel films this is the one wars most disappointed off nothing about is is good only downey jr as iron man is doing well and does what he can not be boring s they others the first time wee see hulk hes angry on every one and the the second time hes only after the bad guys for some reason it doesn make any sense at all one off the biggest failure in all off the superhero genre and why the hell is captain america bigger than iron man in some scenes and on the main poster for the movie and then the movie is so confusing and unrealistic really don hope the next one is coming any soon but if it is josh wheedon have to stay away and give space for matthew vaughn ', ' this feels like fanfic rather than professionally written story there are lot of nonsense and questionable poorly motivated choices writers ignore their own rules that they have set in the universe such shame because characters and overall setting are quite good ', ' m big fan of the marvel cinematic universe so had to watch this one and let me tell you was glued to the screen all the time can wait for the hell kitchen devil to fight kingpin in the mcu ', ' acting was good the connection between the characters felt real wasnt just by the numbers kind of action but needed better fight scene at the end somone who actually posed threat even after she powers up wouldve been nice really theres so much to like about this movie cant wait to see her in endgame ', ' just bad cheesy acting poor story and little action not recommended lead character is very weak and the rest are just plain boring very poor indeed for marvel effort ', ' had fun reading some of the other reviews some people saying they aren taking it serious enough or the opposite it a show about monkey killing bad guys cmon people the premise is so ridiculous that there is nothing to take serious if you just want fun show with some pretty awesome action call this winner just watched the eternals and didn enjoy that nearly as much as did this 8 10 had lot of fun watching this and hope disney brings more of this ps if you are expecting fun show to watch with your kids please don it violence on steroids ', ' am giving this 10 to counter act some of the pettiness going on here yes all just don like it cause she a girl and she brown not every marvel show has to be for you let other people who don identify as you do enjoy the damn show get over yourselves ', ' mediocre thing though marvel and dc were beyond religion but now they are integrating culture and religion into superhero movies what are they trying to achieve this is so insane ', ' good movie good indeed quite spectacle good for kids liked it it was really good nothing wouldn change thing good with the family it was really action packed film cant wait for the other films to come out hopping they blow this film out of the water ', ' the storyline had so much potential but lack of believability even for super hero series and continuity errors make it difficult for me to give this series higher than five rating ', ' liked it not sure what all the hate is about thought it was good movie ', ' ve tried watching this few times now loved all the other marvel shows don get me wrong they weren perfect but they at least still felt like they were part of the mcu this show feels like it should be on nickelodeon and you should be watching it at 8am in the school uniform ve given it enough chances now but the writing and acting is pretty poor for marvel show ', ' the first major problem with this series is that it is not really made for children or adults and kind of slides into some middle ground in that respect the initial story being told is more like family channel show which is fine but then by episode 4 it becomes much more sophisticated trying to include the history of partition in my view the show should have led off with this history to give us some background earlier on the other aspect that found anticlimactic was when the veil opened the viewer is never really explained as to why this happened and is only left to make their best educated guess to me wanted better explanation provided how much time was invested in the hunt for the bangle there are some positive aspects to the show nonetheless iman vellani does fine job and grows into her role acting out being just the common fan girl who becomes superhero the rest of the family also is acted well the actors all feel like real family and make you want to root for them on the downside while the script was fairly well done for the khan family found it to be clumsy and awkward for the scenes with bruno nakia and kamala interacting while there are some decent aspects of this series there is lot of it that feels ripped off of other marvel creations she very much feels like the spider man of across the river in new jersey with bruno as her sidekick just as peter parker has ned playing almost the exact same role overall it passable because of its few bright spots and has some potential to be better going forward ', ' this film is to put it simply is epic avengers assemble is the perfect example of why people such as myself love marvel comics it tells the story of earth mightiest heroes finally assembling to protect the planet iron man captain america thor hulk hawkeye and black widow are put together to fight loki and his evil horde it isn all fighting though it also has comedy element provided by the acting talents of robert downey jr am already looking forward to the sequel this can already be called the best film of 2012 thank you to everyone who helped make this film amazing ', ' this seems more like vehicle to add diversity into the mcu and culture rather than good storytelling iman vellani is new actress and her inexperience is noticeable her deliveries are wooden at times and over the top in others get the perceived need to be inclusive and the addition of south asian superhero female kills two birds with one stone what marvel really needs to do is revise the men and the diversity problems are solved there is absolutely no reason they couldnt revise an existing hero into an indian pakistani character so you have storm black collossus russian gambit cajun jubilee chinese nightcrawler romanian wolverine canadian and many others diversity check huge library of adventures and crossovers check ', ' no point in adding review it just another one of those films ', ' first of all must admit that am not much particularly fan of superheroes in general but have seen the movies leading up to this simply because they were available and had the time and had read up on the hype around this movie so might as well give it go as well and as fairly non superhero kind of guy well must say that the avengers was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie the story was for me at least rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal sure it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies the effects in the avengers were top notch as to be expected from movie of this caliber lots of really great effects and visuals however when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly was ready to turn off the movie that was just silly but decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene however one thing did make me wonder with all the destruction in new york you didn see single civilian getting hit or killed in any way that was just stupid especially with so many people living there in fact you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie which was sort of lame another thing puzzled me when bruce banner turned into the hulk for the first time in the movie he was out of control smashing everything and everyone in sight but somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time that just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation and as with the previous marvel movies with these characters they had some great performances to the movie think that it was actually tom hiddleston who plays loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most the avengers was good entertainment even for an anti superhero guy like myself great action lots of destruction and great special effects ', ' for avengers and for amazing you may think this is an another one of those action movies yes it is and one of the best and that not it as it turns out the movie got more hits for its humor rather than its action adventure combination yes movie with heart fantastic work by the director and the writer for concept as good as this every character is introduced with background so it works out for the people who haven watched the other superhero movies great job done by the writer who also gives real emotional touch to the movie with hilarious dialog which are also worth round of applause excellent job done by the acting team too hats off to robert downey and the animator of hulk take bow the real surprise package was cobie smulders who pulled of her role beautifully too overall m really proud did not miss out on movie like this fun frolic experience through out 10 10 cheers ', ' although the production value is high the overall quality of plot and story is extremely low am marvel fan am happy to suspend most logic because it is comic strip but this movie was absolute crap instead of making me interested in natasha back story actually cringed was bored there was no inspiration nothing there are many logical plot problems simple fixable plot issues but perhaps they think you are too stupid to noticed also maybe they think you will have forgotten the copying they did from other films that was years ago right so mediocre acting with cut and paste script filled with logical plot holes do not recommend but since know if you are reading this you are an optimistic fan then take some espresso with you to stay awake any part you sleep through will be the best part of the movie ', ' scarlet johansson was great as usual so was florence pugh both were beautiful and with great performances but the movie the story and direction was not as good as marvel universe movie deserves ', ' this is the perfect superhero film you will not find much in the way of social comment one bit about loki nazis is bit clunky you will not find great deal back story or exploration of the depths of the characters but this film doesn need those it is awesome and it is fun striking the perfect balance between dark and light in the pain vs fun sense no time is wasted on introducing the heroes or the villains it is assumed you know them already and of course you do and the pacing is perfect the action sequences are well done and pure comic book there is no slacking in the pacing but you do not get lot of the what the hell jst happened too fast to follow action that is the essence of it comic brought to life in way that you don question the balance of the characters is right too stark smartass humour counterpoints captain america straight guy perfectly and the swaggering thor goes well sided with the mild banner and brutal hulk hulk especially is someone who worries everyone in this unpredictable yet necessary he is presence even when he isn big and green sure there are some unbelievable bits if had taken even fraction of the punishment black widow does whilst fighting the bad guys would wind up dead or very injured at best and the consequence of actions taken is not always carried through but hey this is marvel not tolstoy and it delivers the goods as they fit within that universe ', ' it a good movie good plot good casting good acting good videography good animation good sound it all good it definitely not an amazing movie but it a good movie so why the hate ', ' the story line is nothing similar to heroine actual powers and origin in the comics it does feel equivalent to cw show because the action and acting are ok if you don have any background in pakistani culture it will fail to connect with you because all the references will be missed seems like missed opportunity ', ' had hard time staying awake last 30 mins of the movie really lazy writing and not so impressive cgi effects and tired of the cliche russian villain with cruel russian agents we get it in mcu americans are the only good people and the plot has guy with the technology to control minds yet you don see one scene where he has actually used that for any significant effect ', ' love willow wilson books and enjoyed this show aleef the unseen is brilliant and funny and the bird king must read for anybody interested in medieval history ms marvel is great addition to the marvel multiverse gave the first tpb to my daughter who was then 12 or 13 it obviously is meant for younger audience than for example the last dr strange movie however as its protagonist the show has to mature little the storyline isn always very good and sometimes the show is little bit to much totally spies and powerpuff girls and not enough captain marvel or spiderman for example bring him to the harbor really even kids aged 8 or 9 will get that such an instruction is not going to work in big metropolitan area as new jersey why not add simple line like ll send you location it sloppy and gives the impression that the writers aren taking their audience serious there is thin line between making show which is also suitable for children and childish show it little things like this that they ll need to fix for season 2 having said that sincerely hope there is going to be second series because there is whole lot going on that totally worth preserving and exploring further ms marvel has wonderful unique positive vibe and some really great characters anyone giving this show 4 or less must be cynical and or troll ', ' was anticipating this film so much am not one to rush to see film the day of release as d rather watch it alone in an empty cinema few bated weeks past and decided it was time to see the film everyone was describing as the best film they had ever seen unlikely began to watch the film in an almost empty cinema and found myself bored laughed at parts that were not meant to be laughed at and the supposed comedy just left me confused made decision and walked out of the film half way through unsure as to whether the huge hype had just made the film complete let down decided to give it another chance when it was released on dvd realised where the film had gone wrong as marvel fan knew the back story the characters and previous movie plots however the avengers failed to explain any of this no character development what so ever and although was aware of the story found myself having to wrack my brain to remember things from the comics the film is just another generic superhero movie nothing new nothing special realise this is an unconventional view but feel that lot of people would have enjoyed it because they felt they had to guess die hard marvel fans couldn claim to dislike the biggest superhero film of all time ', ' maybe you ll not find this movie as glamour as other marvel cinematic universe film but this is still good action movie that will cheer all black widow fans who embrace black widow as one of our favourite super hero woman ', ' it looks cool when watch it as kid but it actually meh ', ' this started out to me as just fun watch nothing special but some characters had major developments like malcom that truly surprised me ', ' this is the best marvel show ever broke my heart when it got canceled charlie cox performance is terrific love it so much ', ' jon is amazing as the punisher action is brutal on both seasons performances and acting too but what loved the most was josh stewart character on season 2 what great adding amazing he steals the show easily when he appears on screen shame there are only two seasons available 9 10 ', ' think most of us can admit this stand alone black widow movie was well overdue and late to the game the casting was well done florence pugh holds her own against scarlett johansson the actors have believable sisterly love hate relationship with side of kicking to boot the main problem had with this film is that the story itself feels jumbled and there no real flow the action sequences themselves are thrilling and brilliant the dialogue scenes lack sense of believable continuity and have an immediate dip in the story compositional arc the dry humor moments were funny but they passed over them so quickly that we couldn really them all in all it a good film could it have been better yes does it do decent job at telling natasha traumatizing backstory yes should you watch it 100 ', ' daredevil one of the best series of marvel and netflix it story and action are amazing you should watch this watch this show before spiderman no way home and completed this show m excited for reentry of darevil in mcu superheroes specially with our freindly neighbourhood spiderman ', ' just started following ms marvel at disney we as family started loving this series me and my husband are fans of superhero movies but this time my kids loving each every episode of this series this feels so close to our hearts something we all can relate to super good effort with super awesome acting must watch for whole family ', ' first season was ok the plot was interesting the second season just was awfull just lots of drinking and unnecessary sex in every episode she is super strong and winges about it can fight not there is much action hard core hero fans are better of with daredevil and iron fist and even the defenders ', ' they have got all the facts wrong about the partition and about the so called peaceful community the movie is anti india and anti hindu with twisted history and bad direction and acting ', ' it a good thing that they are trying to be diverse here but as usual everything is too perfect people who follows islam gets offended too quickly and so marvel don have choice other than to show perfect family perfect kid and perfect everything when you have perfect everything you have less choice to show the real struggle the series shows the struggle but it an entitled struggle so don think people can relate to that am from one of those countries and can relate to that we are far from perfect ', ' this was overall good movie florence pugh added some amusement with her funny accent and scarlett johansson was cool as always liked the jokes many of them but they re still not in the same class as the avengers movies however if you still haven seen this film do it it was good enough and whole lot better than the new eternals junk ', ' really wanted to like this film but was disappointed am big johansson fan but she seems disinterested throughout the film the storytelling was disjointed and confusing at times the typical pithy dialog between sympathetic characters was as expected for and avenger type movie cinematics were average for this type of film the villain character was never fully developed and was hardly seen at all and when he was he was very generic in presence and his dialog was childish at best was wishing for something more along the line of lucy with this one scarlett johansson is so much better than this ', ' m not sure who this show is for it too uncool for teenagers and it too cringe for adults then we get to the shows comedic efforts which are cliche and don land ', ' for this movie the tfr troll free rating is 7 10 which you can see if you look at the bar graph of the viewers ratings think that about right and that what give it personally it bright and lively and brings back lots of characters from recent mcu outings including the first captain marvel movie but also wandavision and ms marvel which are pretty much essential to understanding the backstory for all of them otherwise what going on will seem bit confusing and it always nice to see nick fury again and kamala khan family too the lead roles played by brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani are all fine and much of their on screen time is spent getting to know each other in rather different ways than three guys would do which appreciated if action is what you go to see though there plenty of it too if anything it just bit too short overall the scene to scene transitions can be bit abrupt and would have liked some smoother continuity with more time to dig beyond surface interactions couple of sections the one on the water planet whose name forget and the later one with all the flerken kitties veer off into crazyland territory but they re still fun add in zawe ashton role as dar benn and all four of the lead roles are women about time based on their reactions it looks like lot of fans just want avengers endgame types of films all the time but that stage of the mcu movies is gone and it not coming back not all superhero offerings have to be major events we re more into the era of ordinary superhero movies now that aren all tentpoles and don mind that we re getting variety of approaches and styles from different directors and studios the marvels fits into that category just go and have fun enjoy it for what it is ', ' admit went to this movie with some reservations and mostly because my kids wanted to see it so my expectations weren exactly sky high still expected something at least mildly entertaining that we could talk about on our way back home as it turned out that movie didn even manage that the marvels is complete jumbled mess it all over the place with choppy editing that leave you with vague impression of watching something unfinished it switches abruptly its tone back and forth making you even more confused visually it wasn great either with an over over saturation of pretty bad and flashy special effects the characters were bland poorly written and un relatable as for the villain it has to be the most pathetic antagonist have seen in really long time seriously who green lighted that character just didn manage to connect for single second with that movie during its course and just wanted it to end now it not the worst thing ever like have seen some people write in their reviews but it was aggressively mediocre ', ' what you might think is just another superhero show turns out to be so much more than that flawed yet fully fleshed out characters stunning unfolding of criminal conspiracy eerily prophetic political commentary psychological case study taut thriller and theodicy genre stories are at their best when they are mask for much deeper and broader reflections on the human condition and society at large and this story delivers demonstrating that we cannot face our own devils without community and willingness to die to ourselves if you only see one superhero series this is the one to watch specifically season 3 you can just find summary of season 1 and even skip season 2 to pick up the story whoever this tonya kong person is deserves recognition as an incredible writer ', ' daredevil is the best marvel show ive seen and read many comics series in marvel love how it draws you in and the actors play the comic heroes and villians perfectly ', ' the marvel movie the avengers is an action packed comedy sci fi movie all in one it has everything and everyone in it all of the marvel characters in one brought together by nick fury because loki stole the tesseract that was found in the captain america movie it has thor hulk iron man hawkeye black widow and captain america all the characters are extremely different which made it very difficult for them to come together as one team against their other worldly foe loki it takes the super heroes to get past their own egos and accept each other help it difficult for the characters to come together because they re personalities are all so different and they re also used to being the stars by themselves so that makes ten times more difficult to come together there is lot of inner conflict with the characters too to start off with the inevitable iron man he is still the same iron man genius with lot of money and huge ego captain america just has came back from being frozen since the world war ii times he isn used to all the technology that is used to really enhance the movie that causes conflict because iron man refers to captain america as an old man then there thor who is loki brother there more conflict he comes to help because he is against his brothers antics loki believes that world shouldn have freedom like ours does he comes to be the ruler and demands it then there natasha or the black widow to me the typical woman in super hero movie she almost seductive they have her in tight clothing and she manipulative am surprised that she can hold her own figured they would have made her more of damsel in distress because she is the only woman in the movie really her friend hawkeye becomes under loki spell trying to defend loki from getting the tesseract he ends up having to fight natasha and then comes out of the spell the help in the end then there hulk who has been trying to hide and stay away pretty much from people so he can keep calm he hates becoming the hulk but when he does he doesn care who or what is in his way he fights the other characters and tries to hurt them without really being aware disregarding all of the conflict the characters all come together in the end to take on loki in the typical attack area feel for superhero movie new york city it has to happen in big city to show the impact that it had on the movie all around the quality of the movie is amazing the way all the movies were tied together really worked it was all around great movie ', ' so finally got to see this earlier today after weeks of hearing about how great it is and how its breaking box office records blah blah blah watched the trailer several times and thought it looked like fun then it opened and people were saying how much of great film it actually is so my interest started to grow from will watch it at some point to need to see what the fuss is about and thats what did this morning all the characters work out great especially the sparring relationship between thor and the hulk as well the bickering between captain america and iron man direction wise meh by the numbers with budget this big and the resources available with that sort of money however it the films script that really shines so tightly written there no throw away dialogue think what people have gotten so excited about is the eye candy over anything else and this film is beautiful to look at but looks fade very quickly and this will soon be added to the pile of cgi heavy films that look kinda dated and hammy compared to the next big thing overall nice to look and great script but lacks the weight and enduring impact it should have understand iron man 3 comes out next year and that will no doubt eclipse the memory of this like said in the title it just more fluff 6 10 ', ' the taskmaster thing was stupid disappointing the movie collapses with every minute that progresses ', ' this movie is kinda different than other mcu movies but in order to make it different they kinda made it worse there are lots of plotholes in the movie this movie could have been made way better with better writing and story pacing cinematography also looked bit bad although enjoyed it only little bit despite it being bad movie actors did great job we must admit that sound works are okay not great but works only best thing about this movie is the credit scenes young avengers were already matter of discussion in the media now they are really bringing it hoping it will not be as bad as this movie and on the other hand to see beast after all these years is treat to our eyes waiting for deadpool 3 hopefully we will see lot of previous men members in the movie ', ' the first half hour was ok the rest kinda awful not worth seeing ', ' great so much action second season diferent from the first one but job done frank is punisher ', ' do not go to the movies expecting to watch masterpiece with that said this is most definitely an enjoyable movies that had its funny moments and some spectacular action scenes and special effects the last 20 minutes was phenomenal and worthy of marvel movie however the only issue had with the movie was the fact the russian accent was poorly imitated by american actors except that everything else was smooth and can definitely state that had blast watching this film ', ' going into this movie was afraid there would be no plot and mindless action and the characters wouldn have enough screen time because there were too many surprise surprise the plot was pretty non existent but that didn really stop this movie from being lot of fun give most of the credit to the actors if you care about the people you are watching you will automatically enjoy the movie more every single character in this movie is played to perfection by their actor or actress which makes you care about the characters which helps make up for the lack of plot because lets be honest the entire movie takes place on flying aircraft carrier with the superheroes arguing with each other just waiting for the big finale in new york mark ruffalo finally makes the hulk likable and the cgi hulk was pretty bad ass tom hiddleston is an awesome loki he not as good as he was in thor but m not sure that was even possible even supporting actors like clark gregg who plays colston plays his part perfect it could have been better it predictable and maybe the first hour is little slow but it funny well acted and the action scenes are great so its worth watch ', ' underwhelming storyline and worst cgi they ve ever had not sure how the director approved this but it telling ', ' ok first of all people it not that deep it a light hearted show and the main character is what 16 the main issue is there hasn been much ms marvel so far imagine watching superman movie and 97 of the movie is about clark kent and superman makes an appearance for 5 minutes hopefully as the season goes on ms marvel will get more than 5 minutes of screen time per episode as much as love tony stark if m watching an ironman movie ironman needs to have more than 5 or 10 minutes of screen time at this point m not really looking forward to another ms marvel episode if there barely any ms marvel in it ', ' beleive it or not really enjoyed all three seasons the characterisation the acting really quite good it one massive failing put down to the writers to be frank jessica and more so trish continually show abject stupidity in the decisions they make know there has to be building of tension for the storyline but there appears to be large amount of laziness in making the story progress unfortunately it appears the writers made conscious decision to just let the storyline meander by allowing too often acts of incredible foolhardyness it detracts from what is actually very entertaining series ', ' maybe some kids wrote the script for the 2 season my god hard to see if going to be like this is better to cancel this show ', ' being kid that grew up with comics eventually does come down to some basic questions that must be answered who would win in fight between thor and hulk between hulk and iron man does captain america stand chance against god of asgard all these answers have been partially answered through the comic medium however seeing this childhood memory play in front of your eyes and in 3d is quite the eye opener the avengers is not an origins movie which means story must be told mr whedon did the super hero genre an immense favor by achieving what almost no one else managed in the last 12 years he filmed comic book the avengers is typical marvel story its recipe being the one that kept comics popular for the last 60 years or so bad guy makes move good guys make stand but fail because they are divided through their loss they understand they must unite and united they win marvel delivers on all levels it knows that robert downey jr is the movie super star so not only he gets the longest screen time but he also has the funniest lines and proves to be better man that he believes chris hemsworth is better thor than last time mark ruffalo steals the show as bruce banner hulk making this the only worthwhile appearance of the character on celluloid captain america does not quite live up to the challenge but mr whedon knows how to use the character in valuable way as result all the scenes between the movie big heroes with big egos are smart funny and keep getting better and better the film visual sound effects are magnificent and 3d make this movie an unforgettable experience so do yourself favor and watch it in cinema the action scenes are wonderful cocktail of action humor that comes across very successfully as over dramatization in this kind of films usually proves ridiculous marvel was very lucky in making fantastic iron man movie out of the blue mostly thanks to the talent of robert downey jr while the other three films that introduced the avengers characters were rather average captain america thor hulk 2 this made lot of people including myself very uncertain about whether the avengers movie would not be the biggest flop of them all was extremely surprised to see film that delivers on all levels and is in my opinion the best super hero movie marvel has ever made this is personal triumph for mr whedon who scripted and directed rather modestly film that could had failed in so many different ways it is also great achievement for the production team the all star cast and the crew who cooperated successfully to manage very fine balance between action comedy and special effects if you like comic books this is single handedly the best super hero movie since men2 and if you like super hero movies it doesn get better than this ', ' really tried hard to like this the was lot of money put into this movie so thought just give it chance the actors are not bad but the plot and action scenes are disappointing brie larson is great actor but was truly wasted with this script the move goes nowhere quickly jumping from disaster to even bigger disaster don know who writes this marvel franchise has truly lost the plot since disney took over only hope and pray that they can get better story even the characters especially the villain does not entertain at all it a great waste of two hours if you are bored out of your mind or on plane with nothing else to watch give it chance if not give it skip as there are far better movies and series out there ', ' definitely one of the best superhero show till date charlie cox performance is very good vincent deonofria nailed it as kingpin very much eager to see daredevil in disney plus ', ' this is the worst super hero marvel has made she is an alcoholic skeleton looking like can fight annoying nothing to look at iron fist daredevil luke cage awesome defenders cool but when she came out in it the camera on the fighting scenes didn even point at her cause she can fight all she can do is jump high wow my chihuahuas do that all the time and they are 2 lbs strong wow luke cage is better sorry but after watching the show am upset cause it was boring and lost my awesome time on jessica jones don recommend watching it not unless your 60 years old and blind my opinion ', ' this show rocks bernthal does an amazing job at playing himself as he has in every other show the hardass hero with some demons it got dark tone and deals with message that concerns guns in the modern era worth watching and highly addictive ', ' the avengers movie wasn loved for its mind bending plot line or realistic character development it was so damn hot because of stellar cast mind blowing graphics and electric chemistry between the superheroes this tv show has none of that you might ve expected something at least on par with whedon previous works but the apple fell so far away from the tree you would ve thought it was an asylum parody the leading man is cardboard cutout of clich him and the supporting cast is new and it shows their terrible acting is preceded only by their terrible dialogue in an era of clever relatable tearjerking rage inducing tv shows it a wonder how the writers thought they could get away with this ', ' first 15 minutes look promising from then on it goes down the mountain bad movie ', ' for those who are expecting another daredevil you will be very disappointed there are no impressive stunts great effects or even that many fight scenes while both jessica jones and luke cage have super strength you won see it being used too often but if you think of it more as separate series with loose ties to daredevil you might like it more the writing is good the acting is good and don understand where the negative reviews saying it sucks are coming from it has very classic neo noir feel to it from the jazz ish music and theme to the environment itself that and very diverse cast makes the show at the very least interesting some might say the gender switch of jerri hogarth might be bit pandering originally the character was man and not gay woman but her character still comes off as well rounded relatable character overall this is good show not amaze balls like daredevil but not at all horrible either ', ' the avengers is one of these rare movies where it lives up to all the tons of hype it has gotten it has made over 1 5 billion dollars and it has received high praise from both fans and critics and the success of this movie is very well deserved the really great thing about this movie doesn come from all the action humor or visual effects it is to see all these characters interact with each other in one room joss whedon truly was the man for the job and he impresses once again with his ability to portray each character as meaningful as the other everybody counts there isn one hero but six of them and they are all relevant and meaningful plus all their character development is superb all of them whedon has my full respect the visual effects in this movie are out of this world it really is spectacular and joy to watch the cinematography is likewise beautiful in this movie but in the technical department all my praise and full respect goes to alan silvestri his score for this movie blew me away especially the avengers assemble tune no gripes from me in the technical department as for the cast they are all terrific robert downey jr is easily my favorite and probably the funniest in this movie mark ruffalo makes the best bruce banner aka the hulk to date with serious and human yet comedic performance chris evans is still quite good as captain america as far as performances go this guy is probably the weakest but he still an awesome actor chris hemsworth isn a remarkable actor either but he has nice charisma and fits the role as thor scarlett johansson is smoking hot and sexy and much more relevant than she was in iron man 2 jeremy renner was agent clint barton aka hawkeye samuel jackson was epic in the role of nick fury tom hiddleston is really strong and serious villain stellan skarsg rd and cobie smulders is also good in their supporting roles ve chosen to judge this movie with what it is fantastic superhero movie and for that it has to get 9 for me ', ' love love love is all have to say this show is one of my favs on netflix finished this season in 2 days ', ' what can add that hasn already been said every marvel movie to me us like work if art and especially in 3d its salute to the master of all comic book characters mr stan lee he is extremely missed not just for his genius but for his humor and kindness his characters are beyond recognition and beyond imagination and its amazing to see them come to life in these phenomenal movies bravo mr lee ', ' this show continues to be huge disappointment no offence to jed but watched the show to see the josh whedon magic saw in firefly this show is completely lacking that josh whedon artistry can only surmise correctly or incorrectly that josh involvement in the project is minimal the characters are so flat and transparent was hoping to see show carried by the characters but instead have gotten show full of clich i nerds vs jocks interactions and cheap dialogue the humorous dialogue also falls flat and makes me groan more then laugh sadly the show really offers nothing that makes me want to continue to watch it the only thing that has made me watch it this long is the hope that there is realization by the creators that if something doesn change it will be cancelled want to see the josh whedon magic ', ' had high hopes for the ms marvel web series but my experience left me bewildered and utterly disappointed the show mishandling of cultural elements particularly its use of indian songs and culture while retaining pakistani name for the main character kamala khan resulted in massive confusion for the audience particularly indian viewers like myself it disheartening to see character with distinctly pakistani name while being immersed in indian cultural references the showrunners seem to have thrown elements from both cultures into blender without any consideration for the differences between them this approach only served to muddy the waters making it incredibly confusing for viewers who were trying to identify with the character background the use of indian songs in pivotal scenes further exacerbated the situation while indian music is wonderful it felt out of place and incongruous with the character pakistani identity it as though the creators couldn decide on which cultural path to take resulting in jarring and confusing viewing experience for indian audiences it was difficult to connect with the character supposed background and heritage which is real missed opportunity kamala khan story should have been powerful exploration of her unique pakistani american identity but instead it feels like cultural mess understand that diversity and representation are important but it equally important to respect and accurately portray the cultural backgrounds of the characters in this regard ms marvel falls short of the mark leaving the audience perplexed and disconnected hope the creators will take this feedback into consideration and make adjustments to provide more authentic and less confusing portrayal of kamala khan cultural identity in future episodes until then it a series that struggles to find its cultural footing leaving viewers bewildered and unsatisfied ', ' there are zero stakes in this film which makes it hard to care much about the fate of its characters too bad because they had ten bazillion dollars and all the good will in the world with which to make this movie oh well next ', ' the critics so far are basically right about what makes it great virtually all of the reviewers have said it has excellent dialogue and great action set pieces no one who is fan of fantasy action movies could seriously deny how good this is as an action spectacle the special effects are very good and put to good use by whedon and his team the tracking shot through the midst of the final battle is amazing the finale is genuine classic battle scene and is as good as anything that steven spielberg would have put together in the same circumstances the movie is funny enough that imdb should add comedy to its genre list and all the other things the critics are repeating so far anyway are true mostly good acting ruffalo is especially good as banner character interactions are done very well everyone gets enough to do that it feels like an ensemble movie all of the title characters from the prior films are portrayed as well or better than in their own films blah blah blah so all the good stuff we ve been hearing reading is basically true what about the bad there less consensus around the bad but probably general agreement that the plot as such isn all that it basically the story as told on the cover of the avengers comic 1 team of powerful but not unstoppable individuals gather together to fight foe no hero could stop alone as time out reviewer noted the plot is basically just coat hanger for whedon to build his character arcs and action sequences but the avengers was always likely to be limited by the need to be an origin story of sorts and so wasn really expecting lot more from the plot on this occasion and the storytelling itself is very good the way the character arcs were moved forward and entwined was done very well the alien army was an adequate but not very innovative way to get loki reinforcements and get big battle for the heroes at the climax the beginning was bit clunky several reviewers have used exactly that word and don think it was very helpful way to get audiences who hadn seen the build up movies into the film there are potentially interesting themes of control power and freedom as patrick samuel touched on in his review at static mass emporium but these are not given sufficient fleshing out leaving the movie in the summer blockbuster category albeit much much better than average example of that kind oh and ll say it again the official title is stupid but overall d give it 9 10 probably 7 to 8 for those who haven read the comics or followed the movie franchise closely ', ' would also argue that there were also too many changes to miss marvel story we all know guess could live with that as maybe most people could and am saying this mostly because miss marvel was never core marvel character but still it is good to see respect to the history of established character thats been around for over 25 years same thing happened to the skrulls that now have been portrayed as sort of good guys when we have seen them as anthagonists to human race ever since they were introduced in the marvel universe but the fact is the movie feels overall below marvel high bar in terms of fun and story also the heroe is too powerful it is on league of its own unless they come up with some sort of kriptonite to balance the odds in the way she is portrayed she could face all the characters in the mcu together with an arm tied to her back ', ' had some expectations and really liked the idea for this show but must say am utterly disappointed with such big names in the making you would want more out of it was hoping to see the same class as the movies at least but this is let down and not as good as the movies some parts were okay though but didn feel that want to watch more of this feeling when watched it maybe had too high expectations before started watching it feels like this show just turned into silly hero hunting show or some sort couldn watch more than two episodes maybe it gets better further along but who knows if so might pick it up again if hear it gets any better further along ', ' 7 0 you say yep at best this was decent saturday morning cartoon fare high schoolers and college kids will love it and have in huge numbers but as guy frozen in 60 time warp much like austin powers can simply say it just not my thing baby the movie is carried by the personality of robert downey jr as tony stark aka the iron man this is no surprise downey is naturally funny and amazingly quirky while still being attractive by contrast chris evans comes off bit like chris mintz plasse showing up at your fraternity rugby party the best acting award goes to powers boothe he has done other notable work but always harken way back to 1980 and the guyana tragedy the story of jim jones no one else in this film acted much in the real sense of the concept they more or less played themselves if you saw thor 2011 iron man ii 2010 or captain america the first avenger 2011 you have pretty much already seen the avengers it was all the film they had left on the cutting room floor just taped back together along with some elements of the incredible hulk 2008 reincarnated ruffalonian style that is pretty much it this film is bit like going back through your favorite scrapbooks it is nice to reminisce and relive the past but you are not going to see anything new ', ' it just another terrible formulaic depthless and piss poor attempt by disney mcu at making movie yes am not sure whether their uninspired cash grabs can even be classified as movies at this point unsurprisingly it oversaturated with comedy that only appeals to 12 year olds has predictable plot forgettable sequences generic score bland cinematography and an awful villain the problem is they took one of the most interesting villains from the marvel universe and reduced him into something so pedestrian that he can barely be even called character scarlett johansson also fails to shine in her own movie instead much of the focus is given to building up florence pugh character which pretty much defeats the purpose of giving johansson character solo movie in the first place speaking of which it apparent that this movie was 5 10 years too late it hardly adds anything to the character and doesn hold any relevancy considering we already know the character fate it blatantly obvious that it only cash grab and feeble attempt at claiming piece of the woke agenda cake it fails to offer anything new or interesting its narrative and characters have no depth instead it so shallow just like most of the mcu that it evades meaningful moments of characterization by wrapping it up with comedy comedy is pretty much what these disney flicks are capable of however watching cuties loving professional critics justify this trash movie is more hilarious than any of this movie jokes avoid this movie at all costs or watch it when you re high ', ' was honestly fairly disappointed by this one wasn expecting to be blown away but had higher hopes for it than it delivered on it felt like they were trying to fit too much movie into an hour and half lot of the scenes especially the emotional ones just felt unearned and disjointed and by extension many of the relationships didn feel very believable there must have been some poor directing going on because there were more than few moments that felt flat and clunky it did have all the trademarks of marvel movie to be fair it had humor it had action it had emotional moments but it just didn really blend it all together very smoothly which was pretty disappointing because think the premise had lot of potential ', ' very weak story and bad action expected much more better than end game but this is what happening the meh thing happens to bw love natasha but in this bw lost her power ', ' loud and overlong with minimal character and plot development and casual banter among the characters that feels more like run through likewise the conflict and plot don really seem to matter and there is no tension suspense or pacing each scene is on same level as the one before you could watch this film with the scenes arranged in virtually any order this thing totally lacks momentum the expensive cast does well enough but the film length and one dimensional plot grows tiresome and the noisy soundtrack seems designed to prevent dozing the avengers is not particularly recommendable nothing about it is memorable or original and it not film feel any need to revisit it a passable time killer nothing more ', ' pro kamala khan stuff is solid cons 1 how are inhumans different than xmen 2 voice acting is mixed but mostly bad 2 1 kamala khan mom sounds likes 1960 not early 2000 in accent 2 2 squirrel girls voice acting is annoying 3 animation is neither distinct or memorable 4 story is mess and keeps trowing terms 5 teenager dialog is terrible and written by someone in there 40 ', ' felt like the movie was more targeted as feminist anti culture than good marvel movie it portrayed that women are weak and must overcome difficulty the movie only portray difficulties from men in order to become strong it also shows that in order to become truly strong one must give in to emotions again portraying men as logical beings and women as emotional they even went so far as to use music with male lead singers for the villain only while the protagonist only had music from female lead singers only enjoyed the movie for its back story to fury the only continuity to marvels previous movies for existing fans is the cgi action scenes ', ' the previous origins movies were significantly better than this blockbuster the characters are reduced to one dimensional caricatures and am fairly certain some of iron man dialogue is recycled from his own series of films the script is poorly thought out why is jane foster not recruited for her portal expertise how come thanos chooses to send loki to earth and why does loki even want to rule earth why does loki ever let his magical staff go why are the alien soldiers incredibly weak compared to the hype how did the astrophysicist somehow resist loki mind control but hawkeye couldn the jokes are groaners am god hulk smashes said god puny god and the premise is cheesy ragtag group of superheroes must put aside their egos to work together as team that being said the action sequences are enjoyable enough to sit through to the end of this long 2 5 hour flick ', ' really bad effort at cultural appropriation was really excited but it was so cringe to watch the biggest factor is wrong portrayal of the character and poor understanding of the culture they come from ', ' one of those movies where no amount of crazy action sequences and effects can make you care about what happening the concept of the avengers is cool but for someone who hasn read any of the comics was neither excited nor invested in the characters boring and lacking substance it gives the normal blockbuster formula and not much else and yes have watched it more than once each time expecting to enjoy it more than the last but alas never do ', ' this could have been great if marvel had stick to the recipe of the first minutes of the film but the whole thing derails in such way that that all can say is to save your money the acting is good but the jokes couldn have been more misplaced the action scenes are either so so or something that would be over the top even for full suited tony stark the villain is terrible and the whole story surrounding him is beyond bad makes little sense and barely fits in the mcu the whole timeline doesn really work and even the post credits scenes is bad given the context that the characters that show up in there were previously inserted bottom line is this is the worst mcu movie by far and did disservice for beloved character save your money or go watch it with zero expectations ', ' if could give it 25 would just because its still good quality video however its basically reminder of what they have done in case your brain doesn have function to store memory disney cancel culture forced me to have no use for another marvel disney attempt at shaping what should think and approve of if you want to give it up vote for replaying old stuff think you are part of the problem ', ' the movie is very good the cinematography and uhd colour scheme where great the outfits and cgi were perfect as they are shot in 4k 6k and 8k cameras meaning the 2k di has better quality pixels within compared to 2k native and up scaling ai also cgi doesn matter as its 3 dimensional and camera resolution can be set at anything in the scene and most cgi is god enough for 8k and it got better as it went on good story to fit in after civil war fanboys are scoring low because their was just too much story to tell the screenwriters did good on it and the ost by lorne balfe was great especially the start with the slow version of smells like teen spirit ', ' don expect too much from this movie very skippable movie it has its moments during the first half of the movie the final act do feel the movie kinda falls apart way too much cgi and lets forget something like physics exist the stakes are also not that high since you know natasha will make it through this whole ordeal because of endgame yelena is nice addition to the mcu so am looking forward to seeing more of her ', ' like most people don take time to review 5 star movies but m trying to avoid rating everything either 10 or 1 star but this rating is based on if could go back in time and recommend this video to myself the reality is just can think of many movies more annoying am very unhappy having seen this movie if you are on plane and this comes on take nap or take hostages and demand they stop the video ', ' if you haven seen msmarvel you may be confused about the two new marvels generally you need to know more than is explained in the movie otherwise nice plot and nice action the cgi is good the humor is less than in the previous movie there is one very nice and funny bollywood like scene bit more and better fun would have been nice the music is bit too much generated and not very individual also some behaviors of the main characters are rather simple minded but then again it a marvel movie based on comics all in all would give it 7 5 rating good movie night but just not as good as the first ', ' first episode of the show is essentially the plot and storyline from disney turning red repurposed indtead as marvel show the target audience is clearly much younger than the previous marvel shows and the acting and punchlines meet that level as comics purist also had hard time with some of the character changes they ve made for the show gave it chance and tried to be open minded but just wasn feeling it ll stick with the comics on this one ', ' the dialogue is sooo sooo bad it a benchmark for terrible scripting the woman with the raspy voice good lord get this crap off our screens jesus christ her acting seems rehearsed calculated and plastic who cast this no talent if you ask me better than daredevil daredevil tries to sell itself as intricate deep storytelling when it is not but this just owns up to what it is from the start just mindless action and this works in its favour going in you know what to expect you know what you re signing up for no intricate plot or suave storytelling here just action the plot isn that engrossing not that well developed the acting is underwhelming actually the acting is atrocious you can see they re acting there no second you actually believe this is story coming alive bad storytelling very bad the action is very choreographed though and since daredevil is more or less counterpart to this can help comparing the action choreography is better than that of daredevil ultimately however they are both just as bad equally ', ' how am only finding hype and praise for this show the actual critics probably haven seen this yet because this show is immediately boring one dimensional trash so far it seems like the show will revolve around jones getting over her ex and spying on conflict from boring distance while having very uninteresting and depressing inner struggle to get her sh together who knows what else its about im dropping it at episode 1 krystin ritters attempt at this character is so boring cant even stomach it daredevil was much better than this garbage but fear if keep watching this it will ruin the daredevil world for me how can so many adults have such bad taste could understand if this was teen drama or something ', ' finally this film is here everything about this film from start to finish is brilliant it is filled with enough one liners to make it funny while the rest is just pure action every fight scene is choreographed and performed to perfection the acting is on point for each actor and the rest of the widow family was cast incredibly well the plot was great but the music marvel always have amazing soundtracks and this is no different every piece of music was incredible only reason this film isn a ten is because would ve loved to see some more taskmaster ', ' okay well granted don have much of an active interest in superhero movies but still do watch them whenever am given the chance and recently had the chance to sit down and watch the 2019 captain marvel movie needless to say that had heard all the moaning and groaning online about this movie which was the same with the last jedi lots of fanboys experience pains in certain backside location enjoyed captain marvel honestly did and can find any hold in all the grief that this movie has been getting online guess it takes very little for tsunami of hatred to get out of control all thanks to elitist fanboys come on this is movie meant to entertain it is not innovative movement within brain surgery or curing cancer this is movie plain and simple the movie had very simple and straight forward story making it very easy to follow so as with most superhero movies you just lean back and enjoy the action packed ride and yes this is an action packed ride needless to say that with this being marvel movie the special effects and cgi are top notch as it has generally been in most previous marvel superhero movies thus far the cgi really helps bring the movie to life on the screen with realistic looking special effects that also look spectacular on the screen personally don get all the grief that has fallen upon brie larson enjoyed her performance in captain marvel again take into consideration that this is superhero movie not heavy drama with intricate dialogue like good will hunting or the like the characters in captain marvel served their purpose and the dialogue was befitting of the characters and their progression throughout the course of the movie while on the cast then must say that it was quite nice to see jude law in movie such as this just shame that he wasn given more on screen time and of course samuel jackson well he is samuel jackson enough said right you know what you get with him in movie then there was goose the cat that was just hilarious and wonderful character and that character added wonderful comedy element to the movie and it fitted into the movie quite well personally must say that captain marvel was enjoyable to watch and was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire course of the movie so don assume beforehand judgmental assimilations for this movie without having seen it who knows you might just find it to be quite enjoyable ', ' guess the avengers was the movie many marvel comics fans were expecting finally after series of solo movies group of the fan favourite heroes were united under the avengers tag ironman hulk thor captain america black widow and that guy with bow the would be hero team bickers bit in the beginning as they are reluctantly put together to fight loki thor brother who is again trying to take on the world this time with help of cube thingie called tesseract that opens portal through which some sort of biomechanoid warrior race runs through to do the actual conquering in order to get the full impact of the movie it would probably be the best to know lot about the marvel universe either from the comics or from the movies as the avengers doesn even pretend to be movie friendly for new viewers it not muddled piece of fan service but it is filled with things that are left relatively obscure without prior knowledge of what has happened in the marvel universe the avengers is fully watchable even if you don know that much about marvel world but it does feel bit hollow experience none the less it just can escape from its roots which have been made during many other movies as said the avengers is not bad movie it filled with great actors from samuel jackson to robert downy jr almost all of which are familiar from the previous marvel movies thay all do serviceable roles they make the movie work but none of them gets huge amounts of time as people as the movie expects the viewers to be already familiar with them be it tony starks arrogance or bruce banners life in shambles caused by his alter ego all in all while the avengeres is not perfect movie it is nice start for probably lot more of them but doubt any of them will be aimed towards people who don already know what they are watching ', ' watched the first episode and was very disappointed and annoyed with all the woke garbage we know she is pakistani don need to tell us her skin color and how hard life is cause label her as brown it super annoying wish they could just leave that stuff out like the actress and the whole pakistan culture can dig it fosho but dang the way they go about it is so cringe and annoying the ending of 1 made me want to watch 2 and there was little less woke annoying stuff which made me say ok am gonna stick with it episode 3 and 4 got lot better so it worth getting threw threw the cringe of 1 almost said screw it hopefully they will leave that stuff out mean in the 4th there was one line but can deal with that but dang enough of people being victims and blaming everyone ', ' dar benn the leader of the kree is after the quantum bands she finds one and the other is with kamala khan dar benn with the quantum band and her universal weapon starts the surge by creating jump points it is upto captain marvel ms marvel and say professor marvel to team up to find out what exactly dar benn wants and stop her from making bigger mess with their powers interlinked forcing them to keep switching into each other how the trio manage to stop dar benn forms rest of the story the existing problem of mcu continues with the marvels as well where we once again get pointless addition to the franchise whose sole purpose is to reveal that post credit scene with weak villain and an extremely powerful lead e captain marvel who gets to team up with two others no matter how much the stakes are raised it never feels like challenge to the mighty superhero instead the focus is on the teen humor the best thing about the marvels is it short runtime the humor not always work as intended though some of the jokes did work to an extent the emotions too were on the surface level only the reunion honestly should ve been dealt better resorting to solving the high stakes problem in simpler way or even randomly figuring out the solution failed to register on paper it wasn a terrible idea but when you have captain marvel it is mandatory to give her strong villain and better story she deserves otherwise there is only so much kamala khan can do with her jokes ', ' it astonishing that this got the green light to be produced and then during production no one had the backbone to mention just how awful it was once again larson phones in her role there is no humanity behind her acting the other characters were poor caricatures of what real people are like perhaps that was for comedic effect but it failed if it was the action was tame the script was embarrassing and the effects were second rate have to assume jackson needs the money to appear in something as bad as this this was pointless movie that just confirms that the mcu universe is devoid of interest and originality ', ' marvels the avengers or commonly known as the avengers is an action packed film based on combination of series of superhero movies that were all produced by marvels the avengers are an assembly of heroes including ironman played by robert downey jr thor played by chris hemsworth the incredible hulk played by mark ruffalo and captain america played by chris evans after an unexpected enemy begins to threaten the security of the world nick fury played by samuel jackson and his partner played by scarlett johansson gathers these heroes in order to try to provide peace from the enemy and save the world from crumbling though this movie was slow to develop and seemed to drag on at parts through the introduction the action picks up as the movie proceeds with well developed cohesion of parts by the conclusion of the film the introduction to this movie developed at seemingly never ending pace did not agree with how it seemed to drag out but sympathize with the director this had to be done though in order to portray the plot of uniting these heroes and showing the initial skirmishes of the heroes as they met each other as the heroes began to get along and unite as team the development of the film began to become more tightly knit the characters grew together starting as people who barely knew each other to fighting side by side against their enemy with the combination of all the well known actors in this movie no one seemed to steal the show or become power hungry for the leading role in the movie as the film developed all of the actors sunk into their roles and adapted to their part and the other parts around them gracefully the cohesion of the film was as well developed and original as it could be the ironman series captain america hulk and thor have already been produced as films by marvel and in comic books in previous years this led to unique and different production by taking all those different films and seamlessly integrated them into one piece this made for an action based film with the right amount of humor to make it amusing and appealing to the audience the cinematography and the setting in the film also added to the cohesion of the piece as whole the setting was based out of cleveland but was made to represent new york with stark tower set up to be in the center of the new york city skyline the real credit should be given to the cinematography of the film which made the film come alive we as the audience feel like we are right there fighting side by side with the heroes helping to take down the enemy at hand in its entirety this piece really captured my attention and left me waiting for more after every scene although this film seemed to drag on at the beginning it ended up being well developed and action packed which kept me wanting more along with the cohesion of this piece came quite original development as the director meshed the different parts and characters together this allowed them to fight alongside each other to try to save the world from destruction you will have to watch to find out what happens as the fate of the world is left up to the new team of avengers ', ' unfortunately after watching the ms marvel series found it to be disappointing and one sided portrayal of complex subject while the series attempts to provide fresh perspective on the comic book character kamala khan it falls short in presenting balanced and fair representation the series appears to be biased towards particular religion and tends to portray the peacefull religion as victims in several scenes this simplification undermines the complexity of the issues surrounding religious identity and discrimination by not providing more nuanced portrayal the series fails to promote genuine understanding and discussion moreover the overemphasis on religious aspects detracts from the central superhero story leading to less engaging and immersive viewing experience while the performances by the actors are okaish the writing seems to prioritize specific agenda over well rounded and captivating narrative overemphasis on particular religion aspects ', ' to the furthest expectation didn give this movie anything above the transformer series thought from the trailers it will be all boom boom etc did have an idea that there will be great iron man comedian in the nice armor suit though but give it all up for joss whedon and his writer friends for creating an extraordinary mix of superhero gang movie the movie frankly did have slow start but from the point where we see tony stark and thor in shakespeare in the park scene the movie hits of with non stop action mixed with very above average hilariousness every super hero even capt nick gets personal intro in the movie each of them better than the other by the way should mention the hulk of this movie separately even though this was his first notable appearance as super hero or in an action role and that too with other guys who are extremely or slightly experienced in action movies mark ruffalo did stand out from most of the them scarlett johansson and robert downey jr were fabulous and incredibly entertaining as usual chris hemsworth proves he is better along with his buddies than alone like in his own thor movie tom hiddleston steels every scene he is in and makes his mark as great actor jeremy renner as of for him really feel like they did make him wait in line to the last with the least important role if there is any in the six of the avengers you can really pull that out from the movie but his hawk eye is brilliant display equally to others overall the movie is great success in my eyes and its worth the while to wait for sequel apart from all hulk is funny in this movie something you don see everyday scene particularly don want to say which includes tom hiddleston and mark ruffalo on the start tower alone deserves all the credits the movie does ', ' for the love of she isnt supposed to be superpowered but she is forgetable plot that doesnt make sense and the biggest waste of popular character since jaws the revenge taskmaster could have had his own series for petes sake ', ' the first season was intense and interesting it had compelling characters and strong actors the second season is not good it is boring has bad special effects and spends too much time on sjw propaganda ', ' its merely reminder of what happened in the movies long trailer per se as marvel fan enjoyed watching it expected something more that reproduction of the movies though ', ' cruising the netflix options one evening my husband asked if there was any interest in watching daredevil was only mildly interested at best but my husband wanted to try it so off we went on our daredevil adventure after the first episode we were surprised and impressed that comic book action series could be so compelling and interesting actors with whom we were unacquainted drew us in completely not only was the script well written the actors crawled into their characters so completely we found ourselves thoroughly enjoying every episode season three is pretty dark and we were looking forward to the good guys finally getting their way and then heard the show wasn going to be renewed we were so disappointed in the decision the season thus rapped up quickly but with loose ends and much bitter disappointment honestly we are dumbfounded guess we don know what it takes if great scripts and great acting aren enough ', ' this show promised much but became unbearable to watch direction is all over the place it probably intended for kids couldn even finish the entire series stopped halfway thru episode 4 better read up on some comics or animated series about ms marvel if you intend on really getting to know the character extremely disappointed ', ' nothing makes sense looks like they brainstormed ideas and just threw everything in the show the worst marvel production by far hawkeye is masterpiece when compared to this ', ' although if may add little personal bias here the avengers is perhaps the hulk movie that never got made until now leaving the other two films starring eric bana and edward norton biting the dust when mark ruffalo was announced as taking over the mantle of the gamma powered being with anger management issues m sure many like myself would have been bewildered but ruffalo shows why he the best hulk just yet and is mean bruce banner as well we get back to seeing banner being scientist enlisted not for his raging abilities but that of being the go to expert on gamma radiation that doesn mean he a pushover when it comes to the crunch and with ruffalo being motion captured rather than having the hulk purely cg is something different not to mention the countless of cool scenes the big monster gets himself into thanks to his powered abilities in short it almost hulk 3 hulk and friends instead but digress the avengers finally made it to the big screen after all those stingers in the various marvel movies gave audiences tease for years the wait is over and boy was it worth the wait we welcome back the familiar faces in iron man robert downey jr captain america chris evans thor chris hemsworth as well as the shield agents in director nick fury samuel jackson black widow scarlett johansson hawkeye jeremy renner coulson clark gregg and new addition maria hill cobie smulders as well as bit roles to others such as pepper potts gwyneth paltrow jarvis paul bettany professor selvig stellan skarsgard with loki tom hiddleston stringing all of them into fit as the villain hell bent on enslaving all of humanity with help from an alien race army of course talk about an ensemble cast and true to form joss whedon devotes adequate time to almost all of the avengers and making this more like an extension of their individual films as we dwell little bit more into the background and issues each hero face some which we know of from their earlier arcs that thankfully don get rehashed too much save for certain quick montage sequences tony stark has just about finished his research on renewable energy not forgetting new version of his armour that we get to see here the mark vii captain america still finding his feet in the real world and showing shades of the leader he growing into and thor continuing his bickering with half brother loki that culminates into having him being sent back to earth to take his villainous brother back to asgaard once again the quieter moments in the film provides plenty of opportunity for characterization and whedon doesn disappoint in showing how well he comfortable and knowledgeable about each one of them from comic folk lore and when it comes to what fan boys all over the world are clamouring for whedon doesn disappoint when it comes to larger than life action that pits the avengers either against each other playing into the hand of loki in his divide and conquer strategy and when they finally get their act together to cooperate and save the world the team ups here either in twos or threes is fun in every essence of the word pitting each hero against each other or when cooperating to address problems that require their unique combined abilities and there always good natured humour around the corner when you least expect some really taking you by surprise yet is still keeping true to the nature of each character if you think the bulk of the wisecracks come from stark well think again whedon also makes it conscientious point never to rehash what had already been seen in the individual movies but providing lot more and expanding the scope from what had been done before assure you that you haven seen the hulk do battle like what he does here easily becoming fan favourite and stealing the thunder from the rest and of course lot more from captain america whose own film saw limited variation in his fighting abilities as compared to what he finally does here thor with mjolnir is another dimension and class altogether while hawkeye finally saw some battles of his own after his short cameo appearance in thor where he didn fire single projectile the biggest challenge and change of course was on tony stark and it would be interesting to see if this change about being less egoistical and self centered would translate into his next film as well the final battle that took at least half an hour of screen time is the avengers comic book come alive in larger than life spectacle that best seen in the imax 3d format so what next iron man 3 will blast off and be first off the blocks then there should be another captain america film that will showcase more of shield guess maybe either thor or hulk may make big screen return next before getting everyone together again for another hurrah hinted upon midway through the end credits but which was mentioned would be smaller film than this one let wait and see but in the meantime get out there and enjoy this one heck of ride definitely film that fans of either hero will find irresistibly awesome and in league of its own more please ', ' very well done total hoot the main actress is natural for the part the visual style is fun and fresh as well her powers manifest bit differently than the comics but that seems to be limitation of cgi and cost overall it works well and m excited ', ' started skipping scenes by episode four then got bit interested in episode 7 and 8 and back to skipping again till the very end god what is imdb rating coming to where it makes no sense to have such repetitive brainless fisticuffs in darkness being getting rating above 5 0 trying to explain the sad life of the people who give this 7 0 8 0 or 9 0 is not my job but it just gives me feel for the low expectations they have of these series people say oooh marvel aahhhh marvel then it must be good some just live on personal feelings for the first season and just seeing people from the first series being resurrected would make them feel good enough to mark this useless second season higher than it should be marked pathetic only consolation is may have saved an hour of my life by skipping the obvious silly dialogue it was refreshing to see that girl thick legs in skirt when the season started but soon overacting ruined it all for me ', ' jessica jones has problems she wants to be hero but can seem to get over her disastrous past she has drinking problem she has no friends she hates herself she was manipulated into killing her lover wife she also super strong and can jump high between her constant self loathing she finds out others dirty secrets and gets paid for it she really hates herself and it into this world we are slowly submerged the story telling slow drowning into her horrid life when we first meet jessica she on the case to find young girl who may have been abducted before the first episode is over things have gotten pretty bad really bad we are also introduced to the movers and shakers and few of their problems trish walker gerry hogarth luke cage kilgrave malcolm as jessica tries to redeem herself and keep an innocent girl out of jail the show goes from film noir to horror bit like chinatown or angel heart except with superpowers and far more violence the show really hits its stride in the second act when game of cat and mouse plays out with some horrific consequences and dirty mind games the horror the show has only hinted at comes out of nowhere and the pace doesn let up til the finale however the finale is bit of letdown after such strong climb it seems the writers or producers had no imagination or not enough episodes to really bring about the destruction they wanted their incredible villain to rain down it rushed and little clunky and little unbelievable but for everything that has come before you can almost forgive it the cast are great krysten ritter flexing muscles didn know she had she plays sarcastic bitch well but didn know she could also do incredibly vulnerable self hating soul her best friend trish is played by rachel taylor and their chemistry is great they are really good antidote to all the masculinity marvel indulges in two very realistic women who are having to fight twice as hard the supporting cast including carrie ann moss is delight moss character shark of lawyer is great foil to both the villain kilgrave and jones she in it just for herself and while she is happy to help jones her decisions to get something out of it are purely believable and the consequences for her and others are deserved however the star of the show is david tennant as kilgrave delightfully unhinged psychopath whose only motive is to make jessica fall in love with him not interested in blowing up city or gentrification or making money his power supersedes all desires the only thing he can have is jessica and he really really wants her watching him manipulate everyone to get her attention and watching him fail to keep her time and again is remarkable thing when he finally launches into series of violent murders it almost like some twisted explosion of sexual tension and his idea of love letter to her the other attraction is the story it starts slow but as we move along we learn that every little detail meant something this adds severe level of gravitas to the final episodes and rewards your viewing not contrived story or moments of shocking revelations everything is pulled together as their mind games are played out ve heard lot of complaints and suspect it due to the show being focused on females think compared to all other superhero shows around jessica ranks in the top believable hero cast of interesting and flawed humans the ability to shock without resorting to tricks some kick ass action and nasty nasty villain d heartily recommend jessica jones ', ' the marvels 2023 is disappointing and chaotic sequel to the much better captain marvel 2019 the film tries to cram in three different superheroes carol danvers brie larson monica rambeau teyonah parris and kamala khan iman vellani but fails to give any of them enough development or personality the plot is convoluted mess that involves kree villain mysterious wormhole and magic bangle that somehow links the powers of the three heroes the film also suffers from tonal inconsistency shifting from comedy to drama to action without any coherence or logic the humor is forced and unfunny the drama is melodramatic and clich and the action is bland and confusing the visual effects are also terrible looking cheap and fake throughout the film the marvels 2023 is waste of time and talent and clear sign that the marvel cinematic universe is running out of steam and ideas mcu needs better writers and producers to get back on course or they will continue to lose money big time ', ' enjoyed this quite bit as an off and on fan of marvel films this one ranks near the top appreciated its scaled back nature and the focus on character development over insane action and cgi and the characters in this are very likeable the writing is also top notch and very believable for an otherwise unbelievable comic book film if you like anything else marvel does there no reason you won like this the 81 rating on rotten tomatoes behooves me like you know what to expect from film like this and it delivers and then some some critics are apparently expecting masterpiece even given the comic book source material which is totally nuts to me how anyone can rate this poorly unless you ve never seen marvel movie before and are expecting titanic or something there not much else really can say about it m not professional film critic and don really want to deep dive into the pros and cons just want to say that think this is great and really stands up to the likes of the latest thor and guardians films if you like those you ll like this it one of marvels better films in my opinion ', ' this film is terrible had no idea what was going on in the first 20 minutes and rewatched the beginning to try and figure it out to no avail the cast was good the special effects were especially great but the directing was disaster the plot was all over the map liked the first installment alot m scifi avengers fan too bad as this definately puts into question possible third installment if you didn catch the first installment then the plot made no sense at all the casting was not perfect either for the secondary characters who really didn seem to fit their rolls well too bad ', ' played well with you the marvel universe and was always fun ride and the plot changes were great cast is awesome and clark and chloe and so fun to watch ', ' today mcu is so unflattering that we forgot how unique this movie was when it come out the apex of various different movies and characters all coming togheter in perfect mix of action and epicness no toilet humor no scenes made just to perform cameo or an easter egg just well told story with really good villain love tom hiddleston and numerous perfectly casted actors the cgi still looks fire after twelve years the music theme is more iconic then ever and also think this is the movie where the costumes were better not too silly but not too serious truly what the mcu was supposed to be ', ' each plot of the movie make us curious of what comes next the direct know how to manage every superheroes and villains in balance all of them has unique strange we keep wondering how iron man look so cool and why captain america is serious patriot the effect and cgi are also outstanding and as usual marvel will give so many easter eggs for geeks to find out the success of this movie come up when iron man franchise along with captain america the first avenger and thor released previous years the avenger can be main contender for best superheroes movies against dc dark knight rise though prefer marvel movies suggest all marvel superheroes movies lover to watch this movie period ', ' we watch this masterpiece with my brother just when we thought it couldn be any worse scriptwriters put their best to prove us wrong this was by far the most ridiculous mcu movie ever we couldn stop laughing thinking what mess the writing was five year old could write better script if you face it like superhero parody then it ok think even dcu is better now end of an era for marvel studios productions gave it 2 star rating just because we managed to watch it till the end think would have left if was alone that ok though everything that has beginning has an end too ', ' congratulations this is the most boring movie ever seen in my whole life require for refund waste 3 hours and 25 for this awful movie next time please turn off the music so could sleep as well waste my time at this movie at the first time get up at the middle of the movie and leave the cinema ve really tried to sleep but the should was too loud and the movie has no really plot the basic plot is simple alien come to america as usual he trying to destroy the world wow surprising the army is fail think ve already say usual and they save the world by the power of friendship boring so if that so simple why does its take 3 hours really can believe said it but require for refund ', ' some of the effects in the 3rd act are so over the top inserting tech or surprise hero helper would have made it better got little too crazy at the end also taskmaster just may be the biggest botched villain of the entire mcu great villain turned into complete trash for this movie this goes into the pile of mcu movies that ve seen but will probably never watch again scarlet and her character is awesome it the filmmakers that did her and her film dirty ', ' the fact that disney didn release final trailer for this film until couple of days before release that included shots of captain america iron man thanos and scenes from beloved mcu films should tell you that disney knew they had pile of garbage on their hands they utilized this trailer to leave audiences to make inferences as to their connections to this film and therefore trick people into seeing this film as for the film itself it is easily the the worst film the mcu has ever put out and disney should be embarrassed to have done so would say the plot was horrendous but it actually had no plot some scenes were beyond cringe worthy while others were just boring and pointless the villain was beyond laughable and demonstrated no pourpse for even being in this film the chemistry between the leads was non existent even though their individual performances were decent would have preferred them to have not given us this film and instead made second season of ms marvel the high point of this film is the mid credits scene and it not even that consequential though it was still cool do yourself favor and save yourself from this atrocity of film ', ' this movie is the worst movies ever made in the history of mcu lame acting by lead actor poor background story and the incredible amount of boredom this movie provides you with is just ridiculous you don expect such highly hyped movie to turn out like this also the character in the movie and the one in comics don resemble each other at all except for their names if you can avoid this movie do it ', ' based on the reviews have seen before watching the movie had put my expectations low but tbh it turned better than what thought would face the starting scenes were good it showed brief backstory for nat and was fine with it then the movie starts and well don wanna go into more details in order to keep this review spoiler free the acting was fine the writing could have been done better dialogues sometimes felt off and can lie that m disappointed in what taskmaster turned out to be still liked the main villain as said it was an enjoyable movie and liked some scenes especially the family gathering ones the action scenes were good but in my opinion there was too many of them and some of them were pointless and kinda predictable the post credit scene was something expected to see and m happy it was included in the movie feel like if this movie was released after civil war and not in phase 4 it would have been so much better so the ending wouldn be that predictable but still say it is worth watching once you shouldn expect very deep or emotional story as prequal movie you will probably like it but let me just tell you if you are comic fan taskmaster will definitely disappoint you so prepare yourself for anything ', ' from casting to action to soundtrack these series just worked for me loved the plot of season 2 even more than the first season the fight scenes were not repetitive they got better and better as the season progressed would say don trust anyone reviews which were based on the first few episodes only watch the whole season because the end is totally worth it ', ' can believe how boring these marvel netflix shows were thank god they have all been canceled ', ' hmmm one time watch movie think movie is good but story line for me is straight forward there is nothing to explain in 150 words ', ' love it family entertainment at its best entertaining storyline and enough fun and intrigue for ages 7 68 can wait to find out how everything connects ', ' am huge marvel geek so if you are not 100 into marvel or superhero movies you should take the following with grain of salt avengers is everything ever dreamed of and lived for it is like was child again watching in awe with my mouth wide open whedon nailed nearly every single scene he made every superhero movie which is already out look very outdated this movie is 140 minutes maybe and 130 minutes are money shots have to find new superlatives and words are still not enough if wanted to describe my feelings and after seeing the trailer and the pictures already had high expectations the charisma of captain america the wild brutality of the hulk the majesty of thor it was all there was never the biggest fan of avengers but right now after writing these lines am going to read up some avenger comic books from my collection and we have 2 am this is how you spend 200 million on movie ', ' probably one of the worst if not the worst movie from marvel ve ever watched by the middle of the film the bad acting boring dialog and characters had me wanting to leave the theatre ahead of time there is one cool scene at the end and samuel jackson is the best of the worse even though his character is made to act stupid and naive idk why overall wish could just get my money back ', ' the only show fell asleep while watching even though everyone likes it the background is very dark and there is only fight ', ' the movie was just absolutely terrible just like almost all of the marvel movies released since their extreme decline in quality if your looking for good old marvel movie you can enjoy prepare to be disappointed this film is full of all the plot holes you love villains you don really care about and extremely cheesy humor that gonna make you exhale loudly and seriously reconsider why you even watch these movies anymore finally would this even be marvel movie without musical scene and who could forget the character valkyrie when they put her in every movie just because nothing was added to the story they could have had million other characters forgot she was even in the movie till started writing this somehow even with my bar lowered significantly marvel keeps surpassing even my lowest expectations for this studio just even just for making cohesive and interrelating story it a movieeeeeeeee why is it boring ', ' where to begin the avengers is where multiple superheroes come together to go against one force from fan point of view the movie hit the spot especially considering that there were references to events which occurred in comic books which were not previously filmed from my point of view non fanatic yet sucked into the hype had the inclination to watch those movies which hadn watched yet with the superheroes in the avengers and trust me it was worth it apart from the fact that viewer would not know particular superhero past there is minute back story which is worth noting from the previous movies so as to feel at ease with the continuation of the story which is seen in the avengers casting was appropriate as most were from the previous films but even roles such as the one which cobie smulders some of you may know her as robin from how met your mother played though small were significant screenplay cannot be argued and the fact that this movie had usp of 3d motion picture the effect changed the experience action is dominant in this film but with numerous combinations of enemies as not all fights are against the bad guy in particular it is exciting as well as interesting with the question of not only who is going to win but how comedy interestingly was present feel mainly because of robert downey jr but others were important factors this movie was not very dialogue heavy but more straight to the point script wise the dialogues were indeed effective as well as pulsating for the the viewer with an approx 2hr 30min running time there are hardly any parts which one would find unnecessary and although it may appear as one time watch there are particular scenes which really make you look for them on youtube and such with bursts of excitement at random intervals and sometimes loads of adrenaline in more than just couple of scenes the avengers took me by surprise and hope it does the same to you s saw the ranking being extremely high an 8 9 on imdb before viewing it and now can see why it was so high ', ' whoever likes dark knight movie will definitely like this series gave 10 10 to only 3 series that is dark series stranger things finally daredevil season 1 9 5 10 season 2 9 9 10 season 3 10 10 best writing best acting best direction best dialogues everything is best in this don even think of whether we can watch it or not if like dark knight movie just go head and watch it ', ' if there is more than 10 stars absolutely will give it to season 3 outsanding performance great writing amazing actors season 3 one of the most tv show have ever seen ', ' good actresses but no plot boom boom is not scenario ', ' short and briskly paced the marvels is an action filled superhero comedy fueled by the charm and charisma of its leading women brie larson teyonah paris and iman velani who clearly having the best time despite its charms the film can at time come across as uneven with some ideas not feeling entirely fleshed out and lackluster villain on par with thor the dark world all in all the marvels is an improvement on its predecessor and is fun journey filled with heart and humor it has few flaws and oddities that most die hard fans will embrace but most casual fans might be taken aback by ', ' the marvel is really good movies the direction is good so are the performances its short and sweet the movie starts on great note set up darr benn as promising mcu villan the chemistry between the cast is the best part of the movie iman vellani as kamala khan is one of the best superhero casting in the mcu brie larson as captain marvel shines once again while with very short screen time the khan family definetly left mark in the movie but the screenplay could have been better and addition of 10 to 15 mins in runtime would have provided better character depth in the movie stay for the post credits ', ' sniper rifle would have ended this complete waist of time in season 1 episode what 2 or 3 ', ' there is bunch of agents flying round the globe in plane doing missions secret organisations alien artifacts superpowers somehow the files popped up in my head mysterious happenings are investigated aliens exist and bunch of scifi fantasies also come true solid entertainment not science fiction nor superhero story though but mystery series errata this was mid 1st season it takes while for the common sf superpower elements to kick in yet they eventually do true science fiction jules verne makes an awful read mostly voyage to the moon an adventure 20000 leagues under the sea described in minuscule details in so many details in fact that the story reads like highly technical report at times if you read philipp dick the father of so many sf movies you ll find simple ideas at the core of many stories nothing new actually seeing the future for instance is an ancient idea what makes it special is the world around these phenomena it is actually thought through how would the world react to someone having such abilities how do normal people or the society interact with that to put it in nutshell sf thinks things through it takes dream and takes it as serious as it gets escalating it until whole new world comes into view this series however states that the events of new york aka the movie have changed the world yet we never see how normal life has changed it but bunch of secret organizations and handful of gifted individuals that popped up while the whole world of everyday life apparently remained entirely familiar and unchanged after an alien invasion yeah sure that actually more fantastic than any alien artifact or superpower could ever be it down to the root conservative in the extreme that not sf at all there is no vision of different world but merely bunch of mysterious phenomena thus it is mediocre series with cheesy superpower sf elements mostly good if mindless entertainment without any hint of philosophical reflection as commonly found in sf it could do with darker atmosphere the characters are too clean and stereotypical yet really enjoyed watching it so far ', ' what can be said about the avengers that can be summed up by the poster in case you ve been living in another dimension the past or with the gods you must have noticed that all the most recent marvel films have been running side by side setting the scene from something bigger and this is it the avengers sees superheroes iron man thor captain america the hulk hawkeye black widow and nick fury come together to fight thor nasty brother fellow god loki just check the poster and promotional art out to see whether you think you ll like it it big it bold it explosive it special effects laden and everything you ve come to expect from summer blockbuster apart from the fact that most summer blockbusters are simply special effects and costly cinema admission the avengers is actually pretty damn good the avengers was released in the same years as batman the dark knight rises and many people wondered whether there would be enough room for two such giant superhero movies would say yes largely down to them being such different types of film the dark knight is well much darker it not so brash and loud as the avengers perhaps the dark knight is the thinking man superhero movie either way if you want dark moody and deep christopher nolen batman will probably fit the bill however if you just want some pretty wicked action great set pieces and bunch of people with superpowers knocking lumps out of each other in silly suits then delivering witty quip or two then the avengers should keep you entertained for couple of hours people have argued that the superheroes don receive equal screen time well they nearly do but you have to expect that robert downey jr gets little more screen time than his counterparts due to him being the biggest star in the film but that should be minor gripe bottom line if you liked any of the previous marvel superhero movies that this film is based on then you will probably like this one but like mentioned in the title m guessing it will appeal mainly to young boys or men like me who are still young boys at heart and it has nothing to do with scarlett johannson in her catsuit honest ', ' was really looking forward to this show and really liked it at first but then it just went down hill after the first episode honestly really enjoyed kamala character and thought the actress did exceptionally well however didn see her have really any character develepment and the other characters found bit lacking and they just weren as likeable they needed better villian and better side characters in my personal opinion also what even was the plot was there even plot and the ending was very rushed just thought overall it was messy and felt unfinished ', ' first two seasons followed and was exited for the next episode then season 3 came and let me tell you it was like its not even the same serie anymore did they change people who wrote the script othervise they must have been constantly drunk while making the plot its so bad and stupid dont even have words to describe it first two seasons would rate 7 10 but because third season is so incredibly bad and destroyed everything this is not worth more then 1 10 ', ' it is really boring marvel is probably thinking that just because they can write marvel in front of any superhero show it will automatically be success this was absolutely ridiculous no character development no plot no coherent story line nothing just slow paced series that had lot of potential but in the end turns out to be complete disaster only recommended probably for very very hardcore marvel fans others can definitely give it skip am truly surprised it has an overall 8 4 rating ps the only positive in the series is rachel taylor she is simply gorgeous ', ' this is mixture of the disney teen problems m special genre and marvel origin story blargh m assuming the origin story part couldn keep watching it m not too old for foolishness love comic book movies but m too old for this foolishness ', ' this might be controversial to say but this is my personal favorite mcu movie up until this point nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently going into this movie in 2012 having only seen iron man beforehand was skeptical and not interested then my brother took us to the theater to see it and it was one hell of blast was blown away and wanted to watch all of the other phase 1 movies and learn more about these other heroes the casting and chemistry between them is on point the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way and robert downey jr humor all around is unforgettable and how can not mention that glorifying theme song not to mention stan lee perfect cameo ', ' the dialog action writing acting all cringe disney handling of this character is shameful don understand why they felt the need to change this perfectly good character as much as they did this show feels like disney channel show from 2009 the vfx are okay ', ' one of the best series they ve made extremely charming perfect casting it stands out among the mcu options in its joyful approach in social interactions reminiscent of the new slider man trilogy earliest movies not having her be super ripped wonder phenom but instead an average teen makes the necessary origin story and power discovery just unique enough to not feel overly cliche as well excellent to watch with family ignore what driving lot of the negative reviews it not the quality of the entertainment ', ' ve been long time punisher fan just because he an ordinary man with the means to punish the wicked and yet he has no super powers so he not invincible jonathan bernthal proves there is hope for the punisher by reviving the series after long slumber have not been this excited to see the punisher since thomas jane last did the movie years ago so am glad to see someone has it right again and it stays true to its roots with some realistic punishing to the point he gets hurt the same overall it has great story great cast and awesome directing about the only thing would really complain about is like others are saying it needs to include more classic punisher moves and interrogations with actual punishments versus just mass shooting killing brutal punches jabs stabs and should feel almost saw movie like but more in the way of how the punisher would actually do things his way thank you so much for making this terrific tv show and cannot wait to see more ', ' watches the first two episodes of this because was watching wandavision and couldn recall wanda or vision from the movies and in this series favor if you saw the movies but need refresher on these two this helps basically they just take bunch of clips from the movies involving those characters and string them together that it if you haven seen the movies you re going to be lost especially in the case of vision saw the movies once each and was still pretty confused don understand why they re pretending this is series instead of just promo material for the series and perhaps eventually other series this is something that should just be on the series website under extras or something so it basically bs but did find it helpful in my particular case ', ' after all the talk from scarlett johanneson it was evident that she was over compensating for bad movie kevin feigi has done better movies before heck even the loki series is better than this and it a tv show anyway liked red guardian big fan of him from stranger things hope to see him in season 4 ', ' this series has brilliant story amazing superhero waiting for next episodes thanks marvel for this brilliant series one of the best superhero story marvel always rock ', ' it is heartbreaking to see show completely overshadow language urdu spoken by so many people no traditional pakistani family will speak anything other than their mother tongue at home hope they pay more attention in the future shame on the actors for selling out their language the indian subcontinent has so many different cultures and languages assimilated in it the series makers should be more sensitive to this ', ' stupid script stupid plot untalented actors the actor acting the character of the punisher is very ugly and untalented actor was disappointed wonder where did they find such actors too many boring flashes hope there will not be second season generally the marvel series are not interesting was not able to watch them entirely the movie the punisher with dolf lundgren remains the best ', ' love the inclusion of new culture and religion that often gets overlooked in other shows kamala is fun and friendly character and the show leaves you in feel good mood little kiddish but in fun way this is one of my favourite marvel shows this year ', ' was person who voted not interested on rt because of the marketing but decided to see it via ticket for alita anyway got to be honest liked it it felt small scale and the story and supporting cast was great the intimate moments were well shot but the action scenes are very hard to follow wish disney would stop hiring indie directors brie larson is miscast don hate larson like many people but she doesn seem like she wants to be in the movie she is the worst part 7 10 ', ' yes the movie is an average film but enjoyed it because finally get to see where black widow came from it nice to see some of what made her her it is shame that they didn get more into it think the movie really could have given us more about the ruthless training and experiences that widow had to endure lot of the movie was implied but not shown the plot was simple it was nice to have some new heroes and villains really liked the cast and the jokes were fun but as said before the plot is very simple pretty much about killing guy guy that we really didn know or have any bad feelings for because we barely even got to see the man being evil the movie lacked on showing the power of the widows they had very spaced out and very few scenes of them did enjoy the sister dynamic of the two girls it was fun to see them both in action and it was fun to see them bicker with each other in way it is sad movie with what happened in the previous film did it do the black widow justice some it really could have been better by showing more it missed all the heart string moments giving us more of an eye candy film with not much depth your pain only makes you stronger ', ' think kevin feige is an amazing producer but always felt it was so dumb that it took so long for black widow to have her film what is more jarring that this came out after endgame which concluded her story nevertheless it is here and was still kind of hype for it despite it all the premise is natasha romanoff aka black widow confronts the darker parts of her ledger when dangerous conspiracy with ties to her past arises pursued by force that will stop at nothing to bring her down natasha must deal with her history as spy and the broken relationships left in her wake long before she became an avenger so is this another mcu hit or miss firstly the supporting cast is all stellar david harbour as red guardian was hilarious and he was incredibly charming even if his character was kind of an ass rachel weisz was also great as melina the fake mother of natasha as she gives performance that conveys the conflict her character is going through yet also being quite lovable florence pugh as yelena natasha sister is the true stand out in this film her performance is so charismatic and charming while also being proper badass her character has the most vulnerability compared to everyone else and florence shows this by really delivering on the emotional performance she also has great chemistry with scarlett johansson so the interaction between yelena and natasha are some of the biggest highlights of black widow scarlett is also still phenomenal as natasha and she still delivers here as well we get to see more emotion from her character which allows scarlett to do lot more and shine in these scenes the music score is composed by legendary composer lorne balfe and he continues to make another amazing score for black widow every action scene feels more hype whenever his score is being blasted and it just awesome the emotional scenes become more emotional and the tense scenes become more tense thanks to his score also really love the action scenes for the most part the hand to hand fights felt gritty and brutal which made it very entertaining to watch there is also pretty cool car chase and fight where black widow has to fight countless other red room assassins which were very enjoyable as well however the story is quite mixed bag for me thanks to how it is executed the movie does lot of telling of her past rather than showing which is kind of disappointing think seeing the red ledger stuff she did as red room assassin would ve given the ending more impact additionally black widow explores the theme of family but handles it quite poorly natasha confronting her fake family is emotional stuff and the movie does show it but it would then deflect it with silly joke which did get annoying this is terrible when it came to the dad red guardian the movie treats him like joke even though he did an incredibly terrible thing that caused his fake daughters to dislike him there is moment where he does start trying to repair his relationship with his daughters which was very sweet but the story doesn stay long enough on this he also doesn get moment to show how much he cares for his daughter which disappointed me did have my issue with how jokes are used in mcu movies but think it is more annoying here than it is in previous mcu movies the story is also very low stakes and because of endgame there doesn feel like there is much danger to our main characters the action scenes near the end are quite disappointing as well there is fight between the red guardian and taskmaster which sounds on paper cool as both have some kind of superpower however the editing had lots of cuts with also constantly cutting away to something else which made it jarring additionally red guardian despite having super strength never gets to show this in the fight there is also final fight between black widow and taskmaster at the end which is mostly cgi fest but is also incredibly short as well it was disappointing final fight for sure on that note the villains in black widow are also very disappointing dreykov the leader of the red room doesn even have much of presence on the plot until 40 minutes in even when they start appearing they still have no presence as the plot is more focused on getting the family together than villains doing something taskmaster may be the most disappointing villain in mcu history they are such deviation from the comic as taskmaster never speaks ever there is also reveal about taskmaster that is just lame overall black widow is movie feel so incredibly conflicted about the story and villains are quite poor but there are moments in it that are very good the characters and performances by actors are all great but some characters don get enough to shine the action scenes are entertaining but it does stumble near the end black widow is movie with lot of good that contains some bumps throughout in the end am glad it finally came out and enjoyed watching it even though it does feel bit too late ', ' the first season hooked me the characters were nuanced the good weren entirely angelic and the bad weren entirely demonic the acting was better than passable and vincent onofrio made great central character baddie some rough spots but hey overall substantively above the usual genre fare sad to say the second season started well and rapidly devolved into too many side plots too soon character intros too many knotty unspoken unspeakable and unresolvable secrets between the characters everybody but everybody is hiding some world shattering nugget of suffering and sinister past linkages daredevil teeters on the line of becoming ridiculous cartoon and sometimes understandable believable character on one hand he is an exceedingly brilliant lawyer on the other just too dim witted in spite of multiple deadly encounters to figure out the sinister hand is not his mentor trainer fantasy people around him die frequently and even elecktra is critically wounded because of his incredible saintly self imposed ban on killing no one around him is permitted to harm anyone even in self defense beyond the convenient knockout blow the thou shalt not kill for any reason rule becomes so clumsy and untenable that after yet another batch of ninjas kill nurse in cold blood you almost expect him to deliver lecture to his nurse friend when she shoves one of them out the hospital window he nearly does exactly that when he reminds her during the roof scene that her friend was killed since the writers seem to abide by the only the good die young law we can look forward to daredevil repeatedly beating the crap out of the baddies and their legions since no bad guy however insignificant is ever stopped permanently by him guess we can look forward to an endless stream of rinse and repeat fist fights interspersed with the occasional bystander getting whacked couple this with the soap opera endless personal crises you start expecting organ music to swell after every character utterance they are gonna have to go some to climb out the the hole they ve dug this one into ', ' just series of extended trailers adds nothing new can see the point ', ' solid episode in the marvel universe don forget to watch all the credits natasha family relations you feel shadow of the soviet union multiple nice fight scenes ', ' my favourite 2 hours and 13 minutes for sure the action the performances and the story are making masterpiece ignore every rating under 7 top ', ' this has green lantern written all over it dumb shallow and so repetitive that it smells stale oh am not describing rotten meat but show first episode lame to summarise ', ' marvel fans are turning as toxic as star wars fans not everything can be remake of iron man and the avengers this is well written and produced sitcom that the whole family can enjoy ', ' this show is not that bad which doesn mean it doesn have problems in six episodes there very little humor didn expect guardians of the galaxy joke every 10 seconds humor but it barely has any comedy also the character development is almost non existent and even when it deals with historically important moments the entire show seems to lack any suspense and the story seems to go nowhere after watching the behind the scenes wish they choose directors and writers based on their talent not their color of skin m sorry for being that guy this is waste of talent for the actors and actresses involved everybody on screen put their best effort and it shows is just the story and directing betrays their efforts ', ' disney vomiting out series nothing about this feels marvel bring back the older shows even spider man and the incredible hulk from the 80s feels more marvel than this ', ' had high expectations for this film as it being marvels 2nd female lead film however within the first 40 minutes found myself bored out of my mind the story is extremely bland in my opinion with the exception of the taskmaster character being throwback to older fans the film repeats them being broken family over and over with the viewers losing interest in the film one positive thing have to say is the start of the film had lot of action which enticed me to watch more personally find the black widow character like cardboard box very bland along with the other characters not much personality is put into the characters which is shame as there is lot of potential the fight scenes are solid except for parts in the 3rd acts where cgi is very noticeable which is shame for marvel in comparison films like shang chi and spider man far from home blows black widow out of the water so in conclusion poor film on marvels behalf and definitely film fans won remember for while ', ' really interesting and different kind of show the thing is this is not actually my kind of show intriguing plot but didn enjoy it as much as other marvel animations ', ' carol danvers is attempting to save the universe but her incredible powers become entangled with those of kamala khan and monica rambeau they must unite to save the world ouch what can you say this is surely one of marvel lowest points honestly don know who the target audience is or who this is going to appeal to young teens only maybe anyhow this was an absolute mess the writing was clearly problematic it doesn gel it is genuinely all over the place do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut it can be the only answer it just doesn flow at all and that short run time special effects some were pretty good some were poor just wish there was greater focus on plot it just seemed like 100 minutes of cgi noise and random events brie larson m not sure about you but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing what didn see was someone committed to the role thought samuel jackson was rather good but again poorly served by the script it didn look great from the trailers and in reality it another clunker from marvel studios 4 10 ', ' cant even finish season 3 it slow its boring dont like any of the characters after 5 episodes realizing m still not intrigued soo m done it too bad season one was good season two well it was good enough ', ' 10 min in and you know the smell is going to linger for the rest of your comfort unfortunately this feels more like mediocre tv series with lots of unoriginal drama and soap there is heavy emphasis on family and the feminine the irony being that these actors couldn lift half the stuff irl if the props were real they rely on cool cgi and tough dialogue lines and all the other been there done that bravado way too much not sure what going on here if it is crap directing or poor material writing in general not even interesting cameos or other marvel characters make an entry super super lame the latter perhaps they were playing it safe and had braindead focus groups or perhaps the writers are out of touch or stuck in the past the locations feel tacky and not very well integrated it kind of jumps from this drama to the next drama event and becomes dull with the broken record tune of the awful past everyone was subjected to blabla bla gosh talk about overstaying the welcome it a shame the studio and producers probably knew the reception consensus and the opinion polls hence why we saw much marketing and tv spots and so forth this has been so long in the making and this is what we get ', ' what went wrong with marvek writers did forest tick them off it like worst series and writing ever had to force myself to watch 3 episodes hoping it will make sense it like writes copied the story from indian drama show and put into marvel or trying to teach about religion ve no idea but m sure this is not marvel ', ' so this movie was phenomenal balance of fun and powerful moments the whole theater left smiling talking it up and incredibly excited about what they just experienced and what is to come ignore all the pre release troll comments captain marvel is up there with the best mcu movies character story surprises and some of the best umm butt kicking provided by the captain herself enjoy ', ' the storyline was so empty there was lot of focus on religion and the race and india pak partition the story this doesn seam to be super hero movie there were no action and her costume very horrible it concentrates more on the unimportant stuff if you watch this you wont get the feeling and excitement of watching marvel movie its so bland have watched and rewatched almost every marvel movie series but this is the worst had to skip most of it cause it was just boring and completely not related to the main story or to any of the characters ', ' the effects are cool the diversity is great but there just not much heroing going on which for me is making me lose interest it also has netflix teen flick vibe about it which makes me feel little old to be watching it m sticking with it but ll probably forget all about it once it finished ', ' it did not needed its own separate show who is ms marvel dunno and certainly most dont care about her the acting is poor characters are very unlikeable no personality to them just another show ruined by disney ', ' from mediocre storyline bad cgi to unwanted banters and meh script people waited so long for this movie and they butchered it this sht is not what ive expected from marvel movie such shame ', ' the avengers has been one of the most anticipated movies of the year arguably of the decade when so many super heroes are in one movie the fans and nerds will flock and that what they did would say that it did not disappoint mostly looking back on the experience have to say that the quality of the avengers was surprisingly poor the acting really didn stand out with the exception of guess who robert downey jr completely overshadowing the rest of the cast the dialogue much like the acting was really skimpy most of the general conversation felt like it needed more time spent on it and it seems most of the work went into the multitude of witty jokes that actually ended up working in their favor the story much like the dialogue felt familiar and at many times couldn help but feel sense of deja vu in the plot twists and the action scenes the pacing in the story was also off and in between the intense and exciting action sequences felt bored of the cheap although sometimes hilarious dialogue the characters were actually quite shallow individual character development was pretty much non existent with the movie focusing more on the relationships between the characters and even that was shallow however all of this aside the avengers was actually good movie the plain fact is that this movie is absolutely everything that fans wanted and with that was able to bury most of the problems it had under romping good fun something that many other movies have tried and failed to do the hulk smashed iron man blew stuff up captain america bashed the badies etc if there was any analogy to describe the avengers it would be that it is like ufc it kinda cheesy and doesn take itself too seriously however when the good guy slams the bad guy everybody cheers when hulk smashed the crowd erupted when loki says some snide comment there was booing and hissing the avengers was not good film it was merely an exhibition of the superheroes power and that was exactly what the fans came to see and can appreciate that ', ' fantastic series once you start watching you can stop this captures the true comic punisher thought daredevil was fantastic but this blows it out of the water ', ' daredevil is good loving series to me and most of fans but we are tayerd of waiting season 3 why is not coming back ', ' the whole package is stunning why in hell has netflix cancelled program that is stunning in every way ', ' oh god marvel please stop making weak series the question for me is why did they change kamala powers seriously miss phase3 very much ', ' what cracking series super violent heroic and honorable in the vein of old boy and other great asian crime flicks honestly one of the few hollywood attempts that can match the best chinese japanese and korean products rollicking great fun and yet amidst all the over the top violence gore and general mayhem the creators have still managed to piece together strong storyline compelling characters and perhaps even an empathy with the baddies definitely not to be missed if you like the hong kong crime and gang genre ', ' somber conversations with characters showing emotions and vulnerability are mashed together with action sequences of invincible heroes on cgi battlefield where characters trauma gets turned into the next marvel patent joke feels like two movies spliced together ', ' just finished watching the show reading the other reviews feel like this show has been misunderstood see people leaving reviews after watching the first episode and that it that is nonsense most of the negative reviews are coming in from older audiences who are not the target audience of this show that is more than evident from the way this show has been produced the casting the editing the direction the soundtrack the dialogues and it sad to see that it the adults that don understand this smh this show is not for you understand you were excited for it because its marvel but as fans you have to be able to understand that marvel does not only cater to one audience the hawkeye show as amazing as the original character was was focused around holiday christmas theme with teeny feel as well love hawkeye the character but sure the show wasn as exciting as had hoped because of the whole holiday feel and the teeny bits however it is for me to understand that this show came out around christmas and marvel disney hasn done anything holiday themed shows so they gave this one that bit as fan did still watch the show sure enjoyed little less due to the lack of action and the big theatre feel but that is okay the show wasn meant to be more than that am still excited to see how it will play into the future movies and shows that will come out same thing goes for ms marvel they targeted difference audience this time and its not surprise even from the comics this character has always had teen feel it was blatantly obvious from the first scene the show was missing the big plot line things did feel little rushed but the editing was amazing super artsy very comic like vibrant thought it did justice to ms marvel whole feel the actors did splendid job specially newcomer iman vellani girl has what was needed for this show m sure she is capable of even more loved the fact that they shed light on new culture and country pakistan m glad they took actual pakistani actors and not just american pakistani m glad they had an academy award winning pakistani director onboard as well sharmeen obaid think she the reason they represented pakistan and pakistanis in semi accurate way always room for improvement of course the background score and music was absolutely stunning vibrant and very fresh yes will there was more action yes wish direction and action was up to the standard of marvel movies yes wish it wasn teeny but as an adult that this show was not for me it was very evident from their teasers and promos knew was in for when started the show but know it going to be linked to other shows and movies coming out in the future so finished it and to my surprise definitely did enjoy it to everyone that posted review even before finishing it do highly recommend you at least finish the show first its different watching it with that understanding not all shows will be the same ', ' first off you have to be naive way beyond pollyanna to think that the orgasmically hyperbolically glowing reviews were not churned out by pr machine it getting easier to decide what makes flick great or not was just rewatching nights of cabiria and it a great case for how rock solid story and labor of love direction more than compensates for flaws in other areas the problem with avengers is that it a hollow concept myth ginned up with some admittedly clever writing and cgi the difference is that to me the writing and production don compensate for lousy core plot line the classic deus ex machina resolves inextricable gotchas in plot development in avengers the deus ex machina is the villain introduced at the beginning to set the plot in motion and give the writers reason to get up in the morning loki touches people with weird stick and they magically become his partisans how lame could plot point possibly be will again mention that once forces contrive to bring our good guys into some kind of alliance the writing is remarkably good even enjoyable but have to mention few more of my personal bugaboos first off being sort of closet discordian my ears prick up when troublemaker god is maligned loki as an evil nemesis strikes me bit incongruous like troublemaker gods they keep us on our toes and keep us from devolving into protoplasmic sludge don like seeing the glorious tradition of troublemaker gods as agents of change being blasphemed like this next look at loki statement of intent he wants to take away our freedom thereby making us free why do feel like m watching dr evil ask for one million dollars all over again don the writers know that human beings have been giving up their freedom to become free as long as there has been civilization are you in relationship in which you ve abdicated your principles for the short term gain of freedom from abject loneliness are you locked into an economic system that takes away more and more of your freedom haven you already internalized the view that this kind of enslavement is freedom don you pay taxes so that bombs can be dropped on benighted wedding parties full of men women and children who haven yet bought into this precise species of freedom the loki of this flick is laughably and lamely late to the game you can see it difficult to get behind the ensuing sturm und drang when there nothing truly relateable at stake on the table in play btw revealing this info isn a spoiler it the beginning point of the plot not revelatory middle or endpoint ', ' like the show not bad m still in season 1 but ok ptsd and drunk doesn give you the right to be completely illogical person but good concept like it ', ' was refreshing to see superhero series without any spectacular action or cgi effects and still being good marvel jessica jones is drama relaying on good acting solid plot detective pi work to get the work done the series is targeted at adults with believable action sequences depiction of sexuality and the darker side of crime my complaints are the show could have been shorter could have easily given us the same story in crisper manner also jones always seems to be using her super power in very controlled manner unlike the brazen use by the bad guy felt it more to do with the lack of cgi budget why make super hero action show and skip out on action sequences jessica jones with her abrasive personality is difficult role to play but still krysten ritter does good job of it with jones what you see and what you get are just opposite she looks delicate with her petite body frame but has super strength she is an alcoholic but got quick mind always sarcastic rude but got caring heart david tennant shines as kilgrave the smartly dressed bad guy who has the power of mind control his portrayal of narcissistic sociopath is the best part of the series the show got great supporting characters that give excellent performances and each and every one have this unique weird chemistry with the jessica jones mike colter as luke cage brings in the guilt ridden love interest his intriguing past and characterization propelling him to get show for himself rachael taylor is great as trish patsy walker step sister at times side kick emotional pillar for jessica jones her charming characterization at times overshadow the jones carrie anne moss is good as the cold blooded lawyer although felt she was underutilized this is not superhero series it more vigilantly pi vs super villain series and good one at that ', ' while watching this movie and still haven reached the end of it m calling 3 5 out of 10 the green screen and special effects are taken wide and lose and makes it all look cheap and rushed through m getting feeling of michael bay put in as much explosions as we can in every fram kind of wibe that the cuteness they put in everywhere no one of the good guys can die here and we must save everyone seriously this was waste of time and electricity ', ' it has idiotic over the top action like all the marvel movies the heroes have plot armor like literally in all the marvel movies the villains are serviceable at best like in every marvel movie except avengers infinity war and black panther and the humor is too childish for the most part marvel formula and yet you are all bother by this on this one you all love black panther with the villain being gazillion times more interesting than the protagonist yet you are bother by natasha sister being more interesting in this one you suddenly care about the realism of the action sequences hypocrites the characters motivations are some of the best in all the mcu the conversations and quiet scenes might as well be the best in the whole run and the twists at the end were good enough to create fairly surprising ending ', ' think agent coulsen walks funny after watching the first three episodes it looks like poor copy of eurika and the fringe merged together also think the acting is poor and the cast seems to be trying too hard to be convincing the story lines of the series do not seem to be coherent episode two for example do not get why the lady was fighting against shield there seems to be no proper plot no mention of hydra so far kind of disappointing not enough depth in the characters nor the villains too much dialog and very little action too many illogical twists all in all think they should veer towards the original comic story which is hydra and shield and stop trying too hard to steer away from the comics ', ' thought it was solid return to the big screen for marvel movies great send off film for scarlett johansson and great introduction for florence pugh for the future of the mcu overall solid film and well worth watch definitely wasn worth the year and 4 month delay tho ', ' at first this show did not grab my attention have been marvel comics fan for many years and have enjoyed watching it grow into some of the best films in the last few years when heard about this show was worried that it would be overdone with effects and that it would lose good story arc and character development was reassured about few episodes into the series as learned about the h e d agency and now few episodes close the end of the first series am shouting to the world about how grate this show is know joss whedon must get hard time from fans of firefly which am one of them and feel like joss must always have to live up to that show which was to infant in its ending am however starting to love mr whedon writing once more this review is personal one from me as enjoy every moment of this series and hope that this will not be another great show that is over criticized and ends before it has truly begun this review is personal one from me as enjoy every moment of this series and hope that this will not be another great show that is over criticized and ends before it has truly begun ', ' they should keep jessica jones on and not end it great show ', ' just saw it and honestly cried lot natasha romanoff deserved better thank you scarlett johansson for 11 years as the bw proving that women can do anything no matter the universe m going to miss her in the mcu also the sister relationship between nat and yelena is setting whole new level for mcu 4 when florence pugh returns ', ' what series must watch so much suspence so much action so much emotions just go watch its worth it ', ' have some much beef with this movie firstly aside from the countless movies you ve to watch you also have to watch an additional 18 hours of tv shows to know what going on here and ve only watched like 6 hours worth cause they re hot garbage marvels ability to keep viewer retention has to be at an all time low the only good thing csn think of about this movie is the dynamic between the main characters at the start it feels kinda force but eventually they do turn into well running team also the ending scene was pretty cold marvel movies usually do have pretty lazy writing but this really takes the cake the dialogue wasn the wort ever but it wasn great either the whole explain through some random mind bracelet really annoyed me really don need so much pointless exposition also who was the villian in this movie finished the movie an hour ago and couldn tell you single thing about them what was their name what was their goal why were they evil ve literally no idea don even know what actually happened them tbh ronan the accuser wannabe captain marvel is one of my favourite mcu character but this was just so mediocre 5 10 ', ' if not for any other reason you should watch this show for vincent onofrios amazing performace as the villain wilson fisk one of the best writen characters in the marvel univers as villainous as he is he is extremly human and you are thorn between loathing and symphaty for him the most human and complex bad guy ever seen in show like this well writen backstory that highlight that evil is often no more than consequences of what person is subjected to way more nuture than nature and this makes him way more belivable than most antagonist on tv the show as whole is good both the characters and the plot and compared to other shows of the same kind it doesnt necessarily depend primarely on the action the drama part is good enough to stand on its own merit you could cut away lot of the action and still have really good show not to say that the action part isnt really good too because it is ', ' short review here action action action action action and not much else weak writing weak characters feels like the script was thrown together with not much thought as if they put all the actions scenes on the board first then half assed pretty much the entire story and dialogue it really is film made for young kids not one extra is shown being killed wouldn be surprised if in the next one there shooting for pg rating only ticket sales would most definitely be higher and you know the more people you can get in that cinema seat the more the studios will make who cares if the movie is pile of and theirs always part 2 to look forward too to bad they re throwing that one together even faster then this one yikes that pretty scary ', ' the first two episodes was the best part of the series focusing on the teenage and cultural struggles in new jersey but then as it tried to include more action and lore it kind of started to feel very cluttered and lacking in focus marvel also does this thing that ve been noticing since endgame that there would be lot of plotholes that are explained in some later films or series don know if they re retconning and covering up or they do it because of the time constraints but it not great move even with all such problems this was so much fun overall and especially the first two episodes various references to desi family lifestyle bollywood and desi music made me giddy throughout those moments iman vellani is such perfect casting she was really the best part that carried the series even when the other things didn work very well watching fawad khan and farhan akthar were joy too hope they bring back akthar again in the mcu ', ' though the storyline of black widow is not nearly as interesting or gripping as it could have been it still does just enough to justify it existence ', ' wtf is this sad tv show none off the one makeing this show have read 1 comic off the punisher netflix punisher is so insane off the comics you can get in one tv episode he dont have any bullets this is sad before you make tv show read some comic books ', ' not just the best superhero show but an outstanding superb show in general very grounded real with zero use of cgi far better than these latest marvel shows by disney loki falcon the winter soldier wtv crap disney is producing rn from the story to the execution this is one of the best shows out there that exists charlie cox as the daredevil was excellent outstanding vincent onofrio was menacing one of the best villian in show deborah ann woll elden henson the other supporting cast was really impressive did an amazing job story plot 10 10 acting 10 10 action 10 10 music 10 10 intro 10 10 best intro ever everything else 10 10 season 1 100 season 2 80 season 3 100 man hope they make more shows like this rather than some typical dumb full of cgi bs that they re making rn ', ' absolutely loving this show it is step away from the usual style of marvel tv shows and the use of animation gives it comic book feel which really like all the main characters are likeable and it is real fun show to watch really hope that there is second series after this one is finished because think it has been amazing so far ', ' kamala khan is an amazing and awesome character but feel like marvel made this show just for the purpose of expanding their audience and showing the world see look how relatable this awkward teen is this does not feel like the studio that made black panther or iron man this feels like disney trying to squeeze money out of cool characters like kamala and send hidden message to us ', ' an espionage thriller taken effectively with different punch compared to typical marvel movies the plot has depth and meaning action is swift comic timing is crisp with backbone of family and borderline emotions scarlett johansson carried her character well and beyond florence pugh is the icing on the cake bit long overall but the story makes it up black widow shines in pieces ', ' captain marvel is everything but bad movie now do not get me wrong it is far from being one of the greatest marvel movies but it is not as bad as many critics and people describe it to be it has lot of ups and downs and that is the exact reason for me to describe it as mixed bag there are some funny and emotional moments very predictable by the way which make it worth watching for once but then there is the big issue with the movie forcing us into liking captain marvel rather then actually giving us solid reasons for doing so and that main issue consists in the not so well built personality of the main hero her behavior and the way she expresses herself make it hard to be likable and after that we have the big problem of her being extremely overpowered and just being big mash up of some of our favorite heroes she lacks the unique look and charisma of the other avengers and that makes her unmemorable and lacking the unique feeling of emotional attachment that you get when seeing the other avengers want to note that this is definitely not brie larson fault and if you want actual proof of that just watch her performance in room and you will understand that she is more then capable of actually playing this character as for final conclusion to this review want to say that if you are big marvel fan like me then you should watch this movie as it actually adds up some nice little details to the whole story of the marvel cinematic universe and makes it more complete but if you are not then you can skip it without worrying as it is not an essential movie to watch before infinity war or endgame unless you are not looking for very serious movie and just want to kill the time with your friends or family or you have watched all the other marvel movies ', ' best done best story best season best acting well done netflix marvel and everyone involved in the third season of daredevil don want to say too much and spoil it for those who haven seen it yet just watch it you won be disappointed ', ' although it was fun movie it was bad and unnecessary in any case went into the film with no expectations even though there are bad movies and tv series like marvel works and want to watch them even if don like them captain marvel is not as bad as it has been portrayed it is simply poorly written it was not what expected from this movie had feeling was going to watch bad film the plot of the film is simple and could have been told as series for example ms marvel season 2 it could be described as the second season of marvel the acting wasn very good ms marvel character seems likable to most people but although sometimes find it likable sometimes don find it likable and see it as contrived character trying to be sympathetic overall had fun with the movie but it was bad movie and didn add anything new to the mcu liked both scenes after the movie of course the second and last scenes were very important for the future of the mcu and were expected anyway the movie is bad by the way one of the best scenes in the movie was the one with cats ', ' poor acting poorly coreographed fight scenes poor cgi could go on but it just generally poor all round it was real struggle to watch and massive step backwards for the mcu it feels like marvel are loosing interest in their own project and are currently just churning out any old tosh to keep the money rolling in m getting bored ', ' poorly written and terrible worst marvel movie ever ', ' awful awful awful movie when my two daughters who are marvel fans especially of the female characters ask me to turn this movie off then you know how bad it is ', ' ms marvel is fine nothing too special or new and the premise isn really exciting but ll watch it out of habit my big problem tho is that the mcu has too many shows it hard to keep up with all of them with the she hulk show coming up in two months don like how much you have to watch m fine with 30 movies but when this is the seventh show that just too much cons the highscooler perspective on the mcu isn original it already covered by the spider man home trilogy it not that exciting everything doesn need to be explosions and people dying but guess m just not that in to this show should probably say tho that this is just after watching the first episode and therefore my opinion isn fully formed yet ', ' as huge marvel fan this is the best tv show from marvel at first was hesitant to watch this show because was afraid of the changes that were made from the comics and everything there are differences but that doesn mean that marvel isn sticking to some of the real origins of jessica jones as marvel fan am going to tell you loved this no matter how many reviews here will tell you how bad or good the show is you have to make your own opinion because honestly this show is so worth watching and trust me you won make mistake if you are marvel fan who at least understands how everything goes this show follows the life of one of our favorite superhero jessica jones who works as private investigator to fight the crimes and all supernatural things that are going on in her hometown new york city absolutely love jessica jones character as well love her in the comics but feel that this jess is more rebellious empowering big fighter she is also all of that in the comics don get me wrong feel like this character is more tougher in the tv show and think the fans are going to love that the villain was spot on marvel fans won be disappointed with him this show may say sometimes gets darker there are many dark themes that are mentioned in the show that talk about real life problems in the world such as violence alcoholism rape and many more things aside from everything the show is amazing the casting plot everything spot on honestly can wait for season 3 and what new things we will see ', ' writers decided it was more important to set up second season than actually write good story there was lot of potential here but the writers it up ', ' after watching this show complaint about low class contents of tv shows than movies are removed this marvel show is some how is equal to blockbuster hollywood movie charlie cox is marvelous in his daredevil role all the episodes from 1 to 13 compel to see the charlie the other promising acting shown by john bernthal as frank castle punisher brings the life in show which brings the excitement to show the actions of punisher again and again this netflix show brings us to return back to the tv those persons have some complaints about the low contents of tv shows must see one time all doubts will be removed ', ' why almost every female lead movie shows all men as babbling idiots in this case the villain guy dreykov is supposed to be this evil genius but somehow gives away all the secrets for no reasons father alexei is babbling idiot the whole movie acting like all russian men are clowns who drink vodka possess superhero power but never uses it natasha assistant mason basically male servant who needs kind words from her to feel better about himself gets hurt when girls make fun of him the government guy secretary ross another idiot with lot of power that he can use to catch single woman without superhuman powers why men would ever pay money to go see this in theaters yelena acted like man the whole movie more or less and that why everybody saying that she carries the whole film while natasha had this sad confused look on her face the whole time what makes natasha the avenger in the first place there re hundreds of girls just like her love watching movies with female leads and always enjoy good story but why to make all men bunch of idiots it sets bad example for young men who watch it go watch anna 2019 and you ll see the difference ', ' the movie felt like it was put together with spare parts and bits including the script it just seems like they took what they had lying around called in the team and had them hammer out some kind of marvel flick which is true for many marvel movies but here they didn even try to make it look pretty or pretend to care story filming editing cgi cast all straight out the bottom drawer and onto the screen have soft spot for scarlett johansson probably watched all the movies with her but even noticed early on in her career that she just can act sadly she wasn even the worst actor in this 3 10 for not being the worst movie in the genre but also not being rewatchable mediocre at best and being an obvious money grab ', ' yes there are lot of surprises and very good starcast especially florence pugh she nailed it as marvel fan it is must watch ', ' as one of the key origin films especially after endgame this movie had created high hopes however it was unable to live up to the expectations scarlett johanneson did decent job at executing the story and bringing more emotions to the character but the action and the acting in few places were too typical of superhero movie and could not match the originality of movies like the black panther it a decent film but it could have been much more with respect to its storyline fleshing out of characters and the screenplay ', ' black widow wasn really bad or anything it was just really kind of dull thought that it started out actually really good but as it went along it got worse and worse like at the beginning it was everything could ve hoped for it had great pacing pretty good cinematography and fight choreography and actually really liked the music it just that as it went along it started to get really dull and honestly by the end it just gave me headache was just so not that invested in the story and it didn do really good job at actually making me care for the characters it wasn bad or anything it was just weird and it didn really do anything new it was pretty tonally inconsistent too and it made me think to myself wait what am watching again by the end it just became huge mess as the music started blaring louder and louder with every explosion there were lot of explosions and it got really loud honestly m not even annoyed or anything because the movie still watchable and you can still have good time with it it just felt really weird and something felt really off with it it actually had some great ideas too but the film executed them really strangely and honestly it just left me really really confused throughout the entire third act like there was no substance or anything there was no plot twist no crazy reveals or anything just few moments that made me go hey that pretty cool before reverting back to my neutral state of not really knowing how to react don think it as bad as everyone saying it is it was honestly fine just wouldn go to the theatre to watch it and it really more the kind of thing you can watch just on your computer at 1am because you have nothing better to do so yeah it was fun and really liked it at times but all together objectively as film it was really dull and pretty boring honestly one could say it was the definition of mediocre ', ' heads off to the director and story writer of this story it was amazing and really want to appreciate the whole team to wind up such huge story in just 6 episodes it was totally awesome and heart touching ', ' another case of terrible writing from disney it obviously aimed at younger audience however the younger audience looked at it and said this is rubbish can we watch something else so we ended up watching ghostbusters afterlife instead disney seem to be under the impression that story doesn matter nobody asked for this series at least this one doesn feel like bait and switch like the kate bishop show aka hawkeye or all the other marvel shows films since endgame ', ' every fan geek ultimate wet dream has been realized in this action movie that brings together all of the marvel superheros that have appeared separately in their own films it not big shocker that the film is loud bombastic and only marginally coherent it also happens to be exciting funny and self aware enough to know just how seriously to treat the material the result may not be one of the best action films ever made but it probably one of the better ones to be released in recent years the boys in this movie robert downey jr chris evans liam hemsworth mark ruffalo and jeremy renner are clearly meant to own the show but it scarlett johannsson who steals it grade ', ' loved this film it worked on lot of different levels as an adventure action film buddy movie droll and darkly humorous family film poignant social commentary and fine addition to the marvel film universe all the actors performed impeccably and the story provided johannson and her fellow cast an emotional depth which really accentuates black widow character arc tonally black widow is brilliant felt the production team accomplished quite lot with this multi faceted movie ', ' as long time fan of the marvel cinematic universe was eagerly awaiting the release of the marvels in 2023 however after finally watching it must say that the film left me hugely disappointed here why 1 muddled storyline the marvels suffered from convoluted and messy plot the filmmakers seemed to cram too many characters and subplots into single movie resulting in lack of focus and coherence it felt like they were trying to replicate the success of avengers but failed miserably in creating cohesive narrative 2 weak character development despite bringing together three incredibly powerful heroines the marvels failed to give any of them proper development the characters lacked depth making it hard to form any emotional connection with them this was wasted opportunity to explore their individual journeys and strengths leaving viewers disconnected and uninterested in their struggles 3 poor chemistry major disappointment was the complete lack of chemistry among the main characters the dynamic between captain marvel ms marvel and monica rambeau was forced and lacked any natural charm the interactions between them often felt contrived and unconvincing leaving me wishing for more impactful and engaging performances 4 underwhelming action sequences for marvel film the action sequences were shockingly dull the choreography was uninspired with repetitive fight scenes that failed to excite or engage the audience with the vast array of superpowers and abilities in the marvel universe it was baffling to see such lackluster action on display 5 anticlimactic villain the villain of the marvels was completely forgettable their motivations were unclear and their screen time was limited to few inconsequential scenes there was no real threat or sense of danger which undermined the stakes and made the climax feel underwhelming overall the marvels was disappointment in almost every aspect from messy plot to weak character development and lackluster action sequences this film failed to capture the essence of what makes marvel movies so special it pales in comparison to previous entries in the franchise leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and let down ', ' suitable for old school man to watch like modern west world movie tough fighting violent gd ', ' there is nothing interesting about this show don like all the marvel shows but at least they are watchable but this show is so boring the problem is that you feel that there is something that can be done with the premises ', ' so boring that you actually cry so loud for watching through nothing absolutely nothing works out in favor for this series watch some actual bollywood instead we atleast have celbratex stars there ', ' the avengers is superhero movie directed by joss whedon and stars robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston clark gregg stellan skarsg rd and samuel jackson what to expect when six powerful superheros comes together for similar purpose of saving earth and mankind the answer is simple action action and action the best part of the movie is it tight screenplay which will make you glued to the screen with lots of high octane drama fights bullets and bombs to give the movie larger than life effect robert downey jr is charismatic as always chris hemsworth and evans does their job with perfection the beautiful scarlet johansson is as dangerous as the superheros jeremy renner leaves impression with his gray shaded character and mark ruffalo the other guy is also impressive but not to forget tom hiddleston the only bad guy stands tall in the group of powerful superheros this is one of the best superhero movie which highlights the characters of all the superhero nicely and will leave you spellbound ', ' 70 of time we listen about tradition and history villains remain almost as bad as in falcon winter soldier there almost no plan to guide the plot it rushed chaotic extremely dumb fight scenes with agents inconsistent emotions scene of death and happy faces jokes 20min later and last 3 episodes are worst for me 3 10 at least first 3 eps were somehow fun 6 10 ', ' this is probably the worst directing storyline ve ever seen watching this movie was torture would rather watch the 1950 superman series in black white and love superhero movies and have not missed one to date the first marvel movie was probably one of my favourite superhero movies of all time and usually expect less from sequel but this is rock bottom the acting is actually not bad just the storyline just makes no sense and it is impossible to follow anything believe the target age group is below 14 year old they should play this movie on the disney kids chanel along with kid danger ', ' what was the point of this crappy show nothing nothing of substance happens here and it a boring waste of time ', ' brilliant talent stunning visuals the perfect origin story for modern day super hero even though was born and raised in rural farmland iowa can find relatable pieces within the characters and family dynamics ', ' the movie chose to write my review on is the movie avengers chose this movie because it is an action packed ad enter that will blow the mind of any human being who watches it initially the avengers movie has some incredible special effects furthermore the producer of the movie did great outstanding job in the form that he made the movie however the movie did have one or two scenes hear and their that were not so great but later would insert scenes that made the watchers of the movie jump out of their seat at the movie theater nevertheless you can not forget the actors who did an outstanding job to initially the movie avengers has some outrageous special effects just like for example the scene where hulk smashes the huge snake with ugly creatures ready to fight inside of it nevertheless the scene were that me my laugh whole lot was the scene were one of the gods from another dimension was trying to explain to hulk that he was god and that gods should not be beaten hulk just grabbed him and slammed him on the ground numerous amount of times additionally another special affect was where iron man shot captain america with one of his lasers that caused captain america to fly back and hit the ground in an instant significantly personally liked the special effect where one of the people at the god and the ballet came back and him them in the face ultimately the producer did an outstanding job producing the movie and adding the special effects needed at the time needed for example the scene where the god was talking to hulk he added the special effect that allowed hulk to slam the god on the god the hard ground moreover the scene where thor was falling out of the sky because he was trapped in huge glass container the producer joss whedon allowed him to break the glass on the cotainer an escape right before hitting the ground henceforth the movie director also did great job on the scene where one of the cops would not listen to captain america so captain america destroyed few of the creatures right in front of his eyes that made him listen to captain america however some people might get get some despite from the scenes were the creatures keep coming in and the avengers keep destroying them specifically when right after hulk destroyed one of the huge snakes with creatures in because whoever it is that is watching the movie could basically predict what is going to occur next essentially some people do like to predict what is going to occur next nevertheless you can not forget the actors who also did an outstanding job additionally like for example chris evans who played captain america who did an excellent job acting in addition chris hemsworth did great job playing thor and destroying creatures finally as the reader can see the movie is on of the best movies ever made additionally you should watch this movie because it will blow you away and will make not want to watch any other movie lastly you will not regret watching this movie because it is an action packed adventure ', ' love this show so much wasn that wild about her origin in the comics with the terrigen mists much prefer the gauntlet that maybe isn magic in itself but activates power she had within herself all this time worked with lot of southeast asian women before retired and it such treat to hear that accent again her family is terrific very realistically portrayed they love her fiercely and want to protect her and just don understand her this may be harder for them as they are raising teenage girl in culture in which they had not grown up but they are trying was so touched in the first episode when her mother painstakingly made outfits for kamala and her father and her father put all that body paint on to cosplay the hulk most parents wouldn do that and it showed they were really trying to reach out to her her reaction was so typical she was horrible teen who only saw that it was not what she wanted and had worked for and that other people would laugh she totally missed the love in it but that such part of being teen like the variety of body types chosen kamala isn waifish she very realistic for girl of that age and ethnicity her best female friend is taller and more slender as think she is in the comics as well hope to see more of her too liked her pointed observation that she is too white for some of their community and too ethnic for those outside the community and her personal decision to wear the hijab ', ' dont know what the others are saying but personally simply loved the movie even though the movie felt quiet at the beginning it gathered momentum later on especially towards the end had descent story line if you are marvel fan dont mind these reviews you will have your money worth just from the post credit scenes we are in the endgame now ', ' went to see this movie with my 17 and 11 year old granddaughters one is ms marvel fan and the other is now for me was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy but no only kids will enjoy this silly mess enjoyed the captain marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted also loved wanda vision and the introduction of monica rambeau and was hoping for at least good continuation of her story didn watch ms marvel because m not teen and knew it wasn for me and after watching her parts in this movie m glad stuck to that all three actresses are good and of course samuel in always pleasure to see but none of the other characters including the so called villain were the least bit interesting most of the scenes were just downright silly hope they continue monica story with better writing and wish marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids ', ' thoroughly enjoyed this ms marvel series some reviews have called it childish well that because ms marvel is child the feel of the show makes me think of the young spiderman movies found ms marvel very endearing and love the ties to family think it very refreshing to see pakistani american and muslim family on the screen loved that loved the the relationships with mothers and daughters too it a complicated relationship but universal across culture and religion we need to see other cultures represented in our media the whole world is not white and christian like me enjoy learning about other cultures and religions think this helps us understand each other and that fundamentally we are all the same we all desire love family friendship and security someone said they didn like the music say that okay but the music was perfect for developing the characters and family they were pakistani family so they would probably listened to some of this music also think some of the music sounds mystical or magical and mysterious this is perfect for establishing the setting when they are in pakistan and setting the tone of the mystery of the jinn and kamala powers loved this show and was sad to see it end even loved the credits hope disney brings it back next season but it looks like they are making most marvel shows one season hope they make an exception ', ' this movie was entertaining but at the same time very slow this movie did have great action but with some bad cgi not to bad part of the story did not have enough to explain lot was left out other than that it was funny fun good acting and very much watchable 8 10 and recommended ', ' was one of the people that was really looking forward to this show but after 3 episodes have to say that it is by far the worst show have ever seen the plots are so bad that in the third episode the best covert operations in the world comes up with one plan of sending monkey into the bad guys lair only to have that plan messed up by the new member of the team somehow getting fake invite to the party skye is the worst character ever watching her hurts my brain the only two interesting characters coulson and the pilot they just ignore this show is pure garbage the characters have no chemistry the acting is terrible and no where on par with even the worst of the movies please get rid of this show before you have to include it in the movies to further continuity ', ' as great as the series is and krysten ritter and all the others are great season 1 the storyline makes no sense other than reason for the series the characters are fantastic watch it but sadly how many lives do you sacrifice before you decide 1 life is all you need ', ' just finished season 2 what waste of 13 hours d give the first season 9 and the second season 2 jessica character in the second season is nonstop self pitying uninspiring entitled complaining brat all she does is complain wish there was villain in the second season but nope just bunch of miserable boring broken good characters that the audience is supposed to relate to wish there was thrilling plot in the second season but nope just string of unmeaningful side stories and mini events that were attached together artificially wish there were interesting characters in the second season but nope they literally kill off every intriguing character within the first few episodes of this season the series went from being clever thriller to being draging soap opera my advice watch the first season avoid the second season and watch daredevil instead the latter is better in every way better story better cinematography better dialogues better characters better action everything ', ' will start with the fact that am harsh person when it comes to marvel didn want to go to this movie because it didn interest me much the first film was bad ms marvel series wasn good except maybe the characters which we also see in this movie and what they did with nick fury in the last couple of years it disrespectful to the version of nick that we all grew up with but because my expectations were near 0 for me this movie was kind of cool do not get me wrong don say that it was good movie there were lot of things that could ve been better not to mention that the villain was the most useless and boring character ve ever seen and plot that doesn really exist but it was enjoyable mostly beacuse of kamala family she carried most of the movie goose obviously can assure you that there were some projects far worse than this she hulk quantumania captain marvel secret invasion and more conclusion should you watch this movie if you watched ms marvel and wandavision and you are marvel fan you should go for it but the most important part is to go with 0 expectations ', ' for someone like me who gets bored of same characters with similar stories m glad started watching this series thankfully the makers have evolved out of expected storyline with white heroes saving the planet people to be honest it seemed bit dragged till second episode though was enjoying ingeniousness of the show but it was total blast in 3rd episode and up till now it has lot to offer hopefully the people would start accepting the innovation and try to watch it with new perspective ', ' james bond mission impossible jason bourne batman that just to name few but that movie doesn even come close 90 tech and action is ok but if there is only 10 substance in movie and m being generous considering what we are going through these days hollywood could step up to the plate not manufacturing mediocre movies anymore instead of trying to make boring money makers it would be great service to humanity to balance let say 50 substance and 50 money ', ' daredevil proved itself to be incredible the whole third season is just bit short of complete masterpiece what makes this series stand out are the long one shot fight scenes that look marvelous there are at least 6 of them throughout the 3 seasons matt dex the punisher and wilson fisk have been portrayed dare say phenomenally it a shame we might never get season four but the third one tied almost all the loose ends and we also got great and happy ending ', ' slow moving childish action sequences and long dialogue scenes make it worse 8 episode season spans to 13 episodes eating out your precious time ', ' it has been while ever since went to theater to see marvel movie because of how uninterested was let alone how quantumania and love and thunder hindered my love for superhero movies have become indifferent with the mcu fortunately because of how cool the trailers look and the return of one of my favorite marvel heroes alongside two other characters am unfamiliar am curious to see how the marvels would turn out which is sequel to captain marvel and ms marvel would say that for the most part it is an enjoyable film but with major creative decisions that did not quite work with me starting off with the positives in my point of view is brie larson carol danvers aka captain marvel finally having more personality unlike the first one where she felt too stoic and showing little to no emotions here she was able to show off her soft side whenever she is interacting with the other two superheroes and as she tries to become leader since she hasn been able to manage team yet iman vellani as kamala khan or ms marvel was an absolute delight to see on the big screen even though am aware that not lot of people have seen her television show or may not have liked it in general we cannot deny how much energy she brings whenever she was given the screen time even though some of her jokes did not land you can see how she reacts to serious situations striving not just to get appreciation from captain marvel but becoming real superhero as for monica rambeau played by teyonah parris there were moments from her that thought she was cool whenever she was showing off her powers especially when she is fighting together with kamala and danvers but there are things that felt were just unresolved or was like an emotional baggage towards carol that just didn work for me the rest of the cast was fine the khan family were all adorable and supportive to look at whenever they interact with kamala samuel jackson as nick fury is as good as always but park seo joon felt like he was there but for no reason at all but of course like with almost every marvel movie the villain always tends to be underutilized even though zawe ashton did her best in her role as dar benn wish she could have been better speaking of could have been better the film runtime which is actually the shortest for an mcu film truly affected the story there are lot of sequences that could have been expounded lot more and the way the movie progressed felt too fast like it wasn giving enough time for fans to take in the information and just being spoon fed lot by rambeau this includes how the superheroes are switching in the first place and how they are able to track down following planets not to mention that certain scenes in the second act felt so off and just trying to be funny for the sake of it which is one of the major reasons why the mcu is already in decline in terms of quality would not give out any spoilers but let me just say that it transitioned to genres that did not expect and it actually turned me off for while just waiting for it to be over and go back to saving the universe again in conclusion the marvels is most likely going to make people even more turned off due to the creative decisions that were made probably from the studio as shown in several videos on youtube but on my end just ignoring how the franchise is being ridiculed as of this moment would say that the cast saved most parts of the film and in way was better than captain marvel and not as bad as people might expect but could have been so much more ', ' trailblazing series that you can watch as family it got good mix of comedy and action and takes superhero genre to new levels iman vellani is fantastic charming and truly embodies the character of kamala khan perfectly ', ' this film is is an empty shell covered with dazzling lights sure it does look pretty but that is as far as it goes nothing interesting happens in this film by interesting mean plot wise not standard fight scene with new people copied and pasted into it the plot is horrific to the point in which you wonder if there actually is one hollywood seem to use the same script for every action film they make only they replace few of the more minor details so hopefully people won notice in an attempt to keep at least some of the male and select female audience awake the director decides it is time for scarlett johansson to pop up on screen to show off her lets say defining costume in such an obvious manner it is just cheap cheap film full of filler material that you will enjoy if you have an inability to think for yourself really have no idea how this film got into the top 100 of all time there is really no reason for it to be there the only plus sides are that the acting and cast are superb it is just shame that they were not involved in something where their talents could have been used in more fulfilling roles ', ' have watched all episodes so far and think the show is starting to grow into itself the pilot showed that the show had great potential however it just takes little time for new cast to feel comfortable with each other that is now starting to happen and the story lines are getting stronger great to see phil back and now am just waiting to see if he reappears in the next avengers movie give this show fair go people are very quick to criticise without letting shows evolve and am looking forward to many more seasons of the agents of shield saving the world the story lines work in well with the movies and with movies about to be released there is plenty material to work with all in all rate this very entertaining show and look forward to plenty more seasons to come ', ' stereotypes galore in this show am usually glad to see representation of minorities in any mainstream media but the stereotype of very traditional family hiding secret and only wanting their daughter to focus on school come on disney this feels like rinse and repeat of turning red with different culture how is disney allowed to keep doing this actors are pretty great so far but cringey jokes and pandering to marvel fans with what should ve just been disney channel original show with no superheroes story doesn make whole lot of sense so far but maybe will get better with more episodes so far ll say it again come on disney you can do better ', ' nothing new is brought to the table here for superhero origin story fish out of water espionage 90 nostalgia hit spectacularly disinteresting film none of the actors seem keen on being there in particular the star anyone who seen room is more than aware of brie larson acting chops and here they are on full disguise her displayed emotions throughout the film range from smugness to total emotional emptiness boring story predictable and unsatisfying twist low quality humour if any and someone please send ben mendelsohn to speech pathologist to fix the lisp and then to linguistics specialist to remind him and the writers that just because the mcu has given the universe english for common language doesn mean they ll use the same phrases as us not worth watch unless you re stickler for all mcu content as unfortunately am ', ' despite the mostly negative reactions to the marvels and some surprisingly high praise from few media outlets did my best to go into the theater with an open mind always go into movie hoping for the best especially when it comes to all things superheroes but unfortunately the marvels is bad movie is it the worst mcu entry actually don think it is despite the buzz and lack of interest in this film let me explain why the 3 main leads were actually fun to watch on screen know lot of people don like brie larson but think she a great actress and good captain marvel but the writing and lack of direction fails her yet again she delivers emotion during times that require it but you don feel the weight of it due to poor setup and lack of time to develop anything this is the shortest mcu movie to date the lack of runtime is extremely noticeable iman vellani was standout as well pouring her love for the character on screen with an infectiously positive performance teyonah parris was also great as monica rambeau once again but like brie larson she was given little to do in the movie there were even decent amount of well choreographed action sequences but all that does not make up for zero character development low stakes directionless plot terrible villain bad vfx cringe side objectives and so much more can go into too much detail without spoiling anything but despite my complaints there is still some enjoyment to be had even if some of it is unintentional laughter from how bad it is at times ', ' seriously have to wonder if being modern teen would have helped don get me wrong can still enjoy re watching the breakfast club stand by me donnie darko ferris bueller and many others it possible to write characters who are teens seeing the world through pubescent perspectives and still draw in both adults and current teens the pilot of this show didn do that it seemed too caught up in the banal trappings of teen life from posting fan kid videos to not being able to go out to beloved event because of repressive parents these are in themselves largely banal tropes story needs to add something new to the mix this show reminded me of my concerns with the way turning red began however there were some rich and unique aspects to that environment which left me hanging in plus some comedic aspects to the overbearing mom archetypical character yet that movie quickly moved into some new territory and became interesting despite being very teen centric plus it dared touch on themes often taboo for family flicks ll hold out hope that future episodes of ms marvel will become more engaging but m disappointed this pilot episode spent so much time in banality not to say it wasn without charms liked some of the animated art la augmented reality problem is it didn connect enough with the character we re meant to think it is product of the main character imagination since they seemed to circulate around her but this was more inference than portrayal in some scenes it was difficult to determine if she was highly creative and artistic or whether she was add or just product of the short attention span cell phone generation ll add they made the dad potentially the most interesting character with couple attempts at humor and humanity we ll have to see also liked the main actress she seemed personable and maybe if she given more to work with she can shine all in all there are so many ways to tell teen centric story which make it interesting was disappointed with the pilot but will hold out hope it can grow and improve but maybe it lost its potential in playing to the average teen ', ' well acted and well written series but couple of characters are unnecessary and these same characters are regular features and are just simply annoying the main lead is great but the lead step sister is in most episodes and is useless liability all the time and so annoying and she takes up way way way too much screen time what worse is she damages what is otherwise great reflect of strong female actors and characters ', ' first of all this movie should have been released right after civil war it would have helped the movie tremendously since there is no actual danger or threat to black widow apart from that they could have set up her sacrifice in endgame with this movie and give it even more emotional weight instead of having it as marginalia overshadowed by tony starks sacrifice now to the movie itself the first hour is disjointed boring even little bit confusing at times how did she get there why did she go there how did she know she must go there etc the action is lackluster illogical and everything just drags on and on and on and was very close to just watch something else m glad didn the middle of the movie is extremely well written and very emotional the family was well casted and especially liked the character of yelena the dynamic between the two black widows was great this was by far the best part of the movie and the only part which actually worked brilliantly marvel should have gone the logan route with this one and focus mainly on the emotional and character part and keep the action grounded would have worked lot better and believe it would have given scarlett johansson the farewell from marvel she actually deserved the last part of the movie was okay but also quite generic at this point we should also talk about the power levels they are all over the place and highly illogical is black widow normal trained person with skill or actually superhuman yes know the answer but get feeling the makers of this film didn black widow should have been dead crippled and unconscious more than once in this movie yes m aware this is fiction but it was so blatantly ridiculous that it was hard to overlook the action in itself is quite generic the whole movie there are no real surprises overall m not sure if can recomment black widow if you are looking for great action then guess look somewhere else but if you want to know little bit more about natasha past and about the character black widow itself and you don mind watching generic action then can recommend this movie ', ' 7 6 for non comic book fanatics although there are plenty of fantastical elements in this movie this movie is an enjoyment although everyone who enjoys this movie will need to be willing to accept the fantastical elements of the characters and main plot points this movie is successful because it is logical and reasonable beyond those openly accepted fantastical characters the action is exciting imaginative and well shown but the greatest strength of the movie was the development of the characters we didn need to know the comic book facts about the characters to understand what was happening moreover the characters had personality they were reasonably complex and interacted with enough pressure against each other to understand them as more than just cardboard comic book cut outs the highlight was the humoristic quips between the heroes recommend that you see this in the cinema in the 3 version as the 3 is done well and not the over the top 3 of yester years but see this with another person who enjoys fantastical stories ', ' at last great blockbuster film black widow definitely delivers good story great acting amazing action scenes florence pugh was particularly good in making her character work brilliantly with scarlett leading role no easy task with one of the best actors in hollywood black widow is great all round entertainment right up there with the best of the marvel films in fact gold medal winner loved it well done to the whole crew ', ' god this is horrible feel so sorry that tennant agreed to do this show get kilgrave into another story line like luke cage somehow and round file this show cannot believe they canned agent carter and kept this tripe the writing is mediocre at its best ritter acting capabilities are clearly overwhelmed even by this highly underdeveloped character and the plot is either missing erratic or downright boring no spoilers but the racism and sexism are fully revealed in the second episode with phrase during certain interaction no spoilers where jessica strength is established because she can endure it that how we re establishing this character strength wow um ok and every one still gave it 8 stars yeah m david tennant fan too but good god it not worth wading through the sewers of this show to get the few shining moments kilgrave or luke cage appear luke cage has his own show now this waste of air time is no longer relevant bring back agent carter ', ' in the 3th season karen is the real protagonist and she does great job developing his character in each episode wont say more because want you to se this 3th season in this perspective like karen is the real protagonist ', ' the mcu is just getting better and better mean wow what roller coaster of emotions love danvers and especially fury if you havent seen the movie already go see it it a great addition to the mcu franchise ', ' ms mavel love everything marvel an this show has its place among them thought it would be cheap knock of of captain marvel but it wasn it was actually great and iman is doing great job whit hear character and is so likeble and funny and for being her first appearance she is great so ms mavel it new something we haven seen before in superhero and it very interesting to see the cultural mix to an insight to the muslim community that haven seen before and enjoyed it alot ms marvel is something can enjoy whit my kids and we al love it and laugh together the show is great and give you al you need for good time and entertaining not just fighting an smashing but also laughing and smiling and lot of fun for al and cultural things that not everyone knows and struggles that people should be aware of and not judge so it gives you little insight in to another persons daily struggles and how it looks from the inside and out which like because love history and religion even though m not religious still like the history around it would recommend this show to everyone it brings little light to your day and make you smile at least in my family and bet m not alone in thinking that so please continue following what ever comes next and give good rating and maybe your own opinion for others sure will because want another season of ms marvel ms marvel will appear in the next captain marvel movie next year so keep your eyes open for that ', ' bland series wasn much excited for this series at first literally had low expectations but when first episode was released it wasn that bad actually liked it at first but episode after episode it was jus flat and not interesting in marvel movies and series if their writing were bit weak they never fail in direction and technical wise but in this series they failed in both poor direction and technical wise poor editing they tried to showcase indian pakistan culture but mostly they failed in that too iman vellani was well suited for this kamala khan characte other few characters were good overall below average series from marvel studios watch at your own risk ', ' expected hit monkey to be really violent revenge story and it is but it does have some good character growth and writing that makes you feel for the monkey and bryce ', ' pretty typical superhero movie with lots and lots of things blowing up also the characters would have had lots of black and blue bruises since they seemed to crash into things up down and sideways constantly ve seen most of the mcu movies involving natasha but still had no idea what was going on until well into the movie maybe about half way unfortunately it was cringeworthy with the child abuse angle as the bad guy organization took little girls right and left and turned them into mindless killers while having them beat each other silly and deliberately killing off the weak ones despite all that it pretty good for an action movie ', ' for more than decade marvel movies have ruled biz office and hearts of fans it was looking that marvel movie is infallible but this movie proved that otherwise everything thing about the movie is forced lead character captain marvel is way too serious and full of herself forcing new character in mcu like this already is bad move and further the movie itself looks forced on fans brie has no expressions and has chronic constipationed look throughout the movie we are not even starting on her comments around the movie release cat was the best character in whole movie hope marvel learns from their mistake and correct their course and don repeat the same mistakes in future movies if it were to continue with their success ', ' black widow 2021 after all these lackluster tv shows mcu has finally released movie which sadly feels like footnote about secondary character that carries no weight taking place after civil war natasha and her spy family try bring down the man responsible for creating the widow program which controls orphaned girls into becoming killing machines the film has sick intro balanced start and jam packed ending that feels rushed and somewhat anti climactic by the mcu standards making it all feel exactly like second rate story about second rate hero that came out 5 years too late what often triggers me in hollywood movies is when they poorly try to fit two languages into the plot which ends up being ridiculous the mysterious language they were attempting to speak would be something close to how 2 year old infant or 95 year old toothless grandma would speak russian because couldn understand single word if the film insists on creating this international spy vibe the actors should at least put some effort into it it kills the atmosphere and makes the movie look amateur when someone says sentence in russian and gets an english reply or when the words on screens are bilingual on top of this we get huge inconsistencies in the narrative that jumps all over the place the excessive action would suggest that we are watching captain america film because natasha is clearly on some super serum based on how she falls from buildings and gets thrown all over the place they could have gone for slick spy thriller style that would have used her agility marksmanship and stealth but instead it was boom bang boom didn hate the film but it all felt simply meh for superhero flick david harbor was my favorite character as he was organic honest and provided few laughs florence pugh did fine job as well but scarlett herself was flat and forgettable the film had interesting villains but in the classical marvel fashion they got about 2 minutes of development also wished they would have shown black widow during her real spy days as the intro suggested but guess that was too much to wish for movies shmovies on instagram for movie and tv shows ', ' and film that has no structure has beginning and has an end the central and non existent part or better and but it a set of gags of dubious taste and this second and problem because you don make such good movie otherwise the visual effects are good credible action scenes more or less understandable the protagonists are in tune and nice but acting is very lacking in my opinion and film that has neither head nor tail very forgettable but nevertheless fun in the limits and one of the positive things and the chemistry between the characters that dominates it but this is not enough to support all movie in fact collapses very often to go to drift puerile and doubtful taste that did not like very much said this do not know if consider it film looks like stew of various things combined with bit of glue ', ' storytelling as an art what that and who cares anyway when hollywood makes tons of money off of bad movies then where the financial incentive to make decent films 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades and have been going to the movies for over 40 years so that saying something for really bad blockbusters first hunger games next dark shadows and now the avengers am so sick and tired of new york city specifically the island of manhattan being attacked in the movies hello it was attacked in real life only little over 10 years ago costing the lives of over 3 000 real people including my brother co worker wife and unborn child but what is really despicable is that at the very end of the the avengers you briefly get to see real life news photo from 9 11 mourning the dead that just plain disgusting exploitation but lets not stop there at the end of the film we get to briefly hear local new york state senator rant about how our avenger heroes wrecked manhattan that our heroes who just risked their lives in 1 000 ways are to blame for all the destruction fine agree many politicians are real jerks but to put the letter next to this senator name speaks volumes about the films real message democrats holding elective office are nothing more than ungrateful winy creeps that real cute thought hollywood was sooooooo liberal if you going to interject politics into film then why not put r after the senator name after all the republicans in congress fought tooth and nail to prevent the establishment of federally funded medical fund for first responders whose health was permanently impaired by breathing in all the toxic waste that was released into the air the avengers is also plain boring with the most two dimensional characters in the history of film making sure wanted the good guys to win sure the guys have cute muscles and the gals are all pretty but really now who cares when there is zero character development and the storyline is about as exciting as watching frosty the snowman for the tenth time the last third of the avengers is nothing more than war porn will never watch another super hero movie that has character from the avengers as long as live even for free or if hollywood offers me million dollars overall hollywood has done decent job with the men and the fanatic four but for some reason the right wing kooks who control the avenger characters have turned them into nothing more than an exploitative moneymaking machine no wonder why stan lee was so happy in his cameo appearance at the end of the film it just too bad he and the rest of hollywood has to stoop so low to make buck ', ' black widow is another great marvel movie and perfect summer popcorn movie the cast is terrific and the back story is good stay for he end credits to catch another marvel end of movie teaser ', ' it is overall not so bad or decent action entertainer the only problem with all hollywood movies is that we get to watch all the best scenes stitched together in the few mins trailer it feels like there isn much in the movie since the movie feels like an elaborative extension of the trailer itself this problem could be easily overcome with loads of suspense twists turns and now you know why this film is decent one only still one time watchable for sure for some of its breathtaking action sequences that too performed only by the girls and especially the other protagonist girl acting was so casual and seemed interesting engaging to some extent especially when she was mocking the protagonist actions postures but overall this is an out out girls only film and for that same reason it does garner some attention and this film should ve also gotten such attention ', ' it retcons entire history of natasha romanoff making her act completely different to her past appearances absolutely stupid decisions are made throughout the movie by the characters this deserves nothing more than 4 the mcu is dead it died with tony and cap everything else is cheap knockoff ', ' the story is boring the lead is sweet endearing and good actress but even the lead can save this extremely boring storyline and awful special effects have 8k qled tv so trust me when say they are awful decent entry for small children and perhaps east asians there are alot of bollywood references for example that didn understand because couldn relate to the references felt further divorced from the story as the episodes wore on think everyone would agree that marvel has set the bar pretty high with all their prior entries for both film and television sadly this is the first entry for marvel that can confidently say just did not measure up ', ' on the whole as you would expect the special effects are really good and as always samuel jackson is superb brie larson is really good at carol danvers but thats where the good ends disappointingly the whole moves feels desperate as if someone just needed another marvel movie and passed it to someone saying quick make script so we can quickly pushout poor movie and make sure you tick lots of boxes on the way randomly try and link it with some of our tv series as huge marvel fan just find this dissapointing that anyone whould approve the release of such terrible movie this is the sort of rubbish that is ruining the franchise personally would not waste your time watching this its same old same old over the top and often boring such shame as captian marvel has so much potential to be strong charactor with some of the best stories but disney seems to keep rolling out trash as they dont seem to know what to do with her hint disney get the people that write and make the marvel movies to read marvel graphic novels ', ' ve almost given up on marvel just think they re bunch of silly nerds they really really bit off more than they could chew with this one this needed smart set of writers and an acceptance that the usual lowbrow audience wasn the target audience marvel ve had couple of moments deadpool is great but it pure slapstick and works because of everyone who contributed to the movie that the movie the first season of daredevil rocked but as everyone has already stated the second season is disaster agents of shield was ok till it became obvious it was just the same plot with different toys over and over again couldn get through one episode of agent carter and just want haley atwell to die die die and the thor etc movies who cares it just different clowns in different costumes and things blowing up who the cares personally think dc are kicking their asses certainly gotham is can believe how much get sucked in by each episode so we get to jessica jones think the theme music sums it up brilliantly it starts off with this beautifully dark jazzy theme that gives you nice little shiver ooh you think pensive this has the potential to be weird and intriguing but then the artist formerly known as the annoying guitarist screeches in and with one good key change in wall of over baked nonsense pretty much any originality goes out the window attempt to save with one little arpeggio at the end enter episode and yeah that kinda how the series goes too oh one thing if you are about to say yeah but the comics graphic novels that this was derived from need you do do something for me take your original comic book series for this story in their original plastic covers roll them into tight cylinder now bend over drop your trousers and insert them violently into your anus get it up there got it up there oh yeahhhhhh it up there it up there gooooood now we continue heroine who is utterly unlikeable somebody with super powers needs to smack her her self obsessed friend somebody needs to smack her her annoying boyfriend somebody needs to smack him and so on and so forth nobody not one character in this entire play is likable you don care when or if any of them die they are all utterly expendable not even david the mumbling scots git tennant acting chops could save this he a good villain but this role isn a likeable villain so we get no sympathy hit there either btw he still mumbles several important lines just like he did in doctor who don understand why no director makes him re take is it best take out of 5 type situation with him the concept like all concepts is an old one but the setup for this usage of it really really had the potential to be brilliant gritty pi story reconstructing what happens in flashback shocks aplenty who is to be trusted anyone and what of the villain own background what there what can jessica find about about oops sorry nearly started caring and that the problem it just fumbles on and on with characters making stupid decision after stupid decision and tells story that would have fitted neatly into six episodes but they had to drag it out and out and as usual they started talking about their feelings yeah apparently marvel 2d cutout characters have feelings and apparently we are supposed to care about them too towards the end and out came the fast forward button oh and my god the stunt acting was atrocious what was the story every time jessica picked something up and threw it was reminded of the awful plays joey got stuck in in friends or the set destruction that the boys used to do in the goodies where in it was deliberate for comic effect so bad and just for extra icing extras who do everything short of breaking the fourth wall to indicate they are not real people in the street nossir nossir didn like it by which mean was deeply deeply underwhelmed by something that could have been really good if it hadn been written by dumb people ', ' what can say grew up with these guys in the 70 being an english boy it was not so common to be reading these comics at 10 rather than whizzer and chips et al but always loved marvel for being more real yeh know these are superheroes were talking about did stop collecting them by the time was an adult but yeh still got them all it was childhood dream to imagine seeing these characters in film but film attempts were always so lame until cgi took hold the men 1 2 1st class spiderman 1 2 and yes 3 iron man thor films finally met my childhood expectations the avengers has been the icing on the cake the only disappointment for me is where are janet hank wanda pietro the vision patience comics aside it a great bundle of cinematic fun ', ' ve been watching this show since it birth and fell in love with the characters immediately it been here for over 5 seasons now and has been consistently great there was not one season where was bored like with so many other shows you laugh and suffer with the characters the acting is on point the jokes are hilarious and the sad scenes make me wanna crawl into my bed to cry have rewatched the whole show several times by now thank you netflix and can never get enough ', ' positives the movie looks awesome cgi is unobtrusive and the costumes look almost exactly like the comics traditional but well told superhero blockbuster story putting michael bay to absolute shame simply by focusing on the avengers and not some lame characters no one cares about every superhero acts like they should except maybe hawkeye but he the only one don know from comics rescued the hulk from the absolute pits of the last two movies made about him and mark ruffalo made him the best part of the whole movie by far satisfying conclusion with very surprising and exciting reveal after the credits negatives hawkeye doesn leave much of an impression enemy baddies could ve been explained little more than they were kind of predictable guess my two cents yeah ', ' the only marvel netflix series will be watching from here and until the end of time is daredevil because all the others are just waste of time liked the punisher in the second season of daredevil and we all know what his name can act plus the hype around was crazy good so believed it checked the imdb score which is right about 77 of the time so thought was safe the first episode was meh the second episode was meh was about 10 minutes into the third episode when was literally scrolling on my phone when thought to myself what minute am literally not even giving this show 15 percent of my attention so knew something was wrong then went to my big guns imdb reviews and shockingly lot of them confirmed my suspicion this series is just meh so stopped watching right there and then life is too short to watch hours of meh from what did watch of the series would rate it 5 5 10 but am giving it just one star because most of the users giving it 10 stars are probably bots ', ' think they did great job tweaking the original story to have it fit into the mcu also like that they are tailoring some of the new movies and shows towards younger fanbase my 8 year old was little lost at times watching loki and falcon and the winter solider he loved this show ', ' find it hard to believe that film which was mostly made on computer has such high average rating does anyone care anymore that so little effort and imagination goes into film making avengers is 95 cgi with plot that is staggering in it stupidity and unoriginality two of the so called super heroes have no super qualities at all unless having funny coloured eyes and firing souped up arrows or running around in tight spandex suit showing lots of cleavage and pouting lot qualify as super powers all black widow does is what emma peel did 45 years ago and half as well e kick ass even worse the two best and most interesting marvel characters iron man and hulk are reduced to mindless morons smashing their way through the enemy and without any attempt at the characterization that previous films did at least endeavour to give them every scene and plot twist is utterly predictable the special effects are boring and the only thing to admire is samuel jackson uncanny ability to find high grossing movie trash to take stroll through without making the least effort and pick up fat cheque at the other end now that is super power ', ' it just some footage from earlier movies and stuff there is nothing new why new name ', ' loved the first episode the vfx story telling and great acting made it joy to watch especially enjoyed the avengercon scenes and all of the easter eggs that were included bravo marvel ', ' for the record ve never posted anything on imdb and have been reading others reviews for decade anyway was too lazy to give this show chance because ve not been fan of the marvel movies or the marvel universe overall let me just say was completely missing out so have signed up on imdb just to tell all of you on the fenc ers wondering if this show is worth your time it totally is science fiction but without being campy or too science fiction ey check nerdy references check hilarious and makes you laugh out loud check entertaining and not super serious check building overall plot line and character development check the first episode didn grab me at at all honestly but by episode 3 was hooked what great about this show is that it classic joss whedon you can enjoy it want to watch more of it but don feel compulsed to watch 13 episodes in row most shows these days are mini soap operas with their not obvious but totally there cliffhangers forcing you to watch an entire season at once definitely give this show shot 3 episodes even if you think you might not enjoy it wish had picked this up year ago and am glad gave it chance fair warning if you re not person who can suspend some measure of reality g one of those that could never really happen man there are too many holes in the logic kind of people this show is not for you but you probably knew that also recognize this is not the best formatted review but m in rush to go watch episode 7 now wooo ', ' will say that enjoyed the movie more than most but also enjoyed ms marvel and think iman vellani really embodies kamala and kamala and monica rambeau are what make the movie enjoyable captain marvel is as she is always portrayed as one note but their reactions make the movie bit better kamala brings levity to the movie something believe all comic book movies need less serious tone at times do believe the movie didn deserve as much hate as it got having said that much of the hate is understandable they ve written captian marvel into kinda hole and bree larsons portrayal does nothing to change that ', ' rather would say m disappointed since went to attend the premier show with lot of high hopes the movie seems to be just filler between avangers infinity war and avengers endgame only scene which was excited was to watch the mid credit scene even the post credit scene is not worth waiting for wonder that is why avengers endgame release is kept next month giving less time to digest this movie and appreciate what coming in endgame the character captain marvel was not developed properly and seems to rushed sometimes would have prefer this movie with long run time to get it just the right for the audience to appreciate the story with better writing and screen play overall one time watch movie to just feel the character and watch her next month do wonders in the endgame ', ' picked up on tweet from very respectable screenwriter who mentioned she liked this show so gave it try and could not get past e1 normally like ritter but in this role she did just not work for me at all it way to much stretch for her as superhero and the script did little to assist at all boring tired dialogue there really just not lot to like about this production there a bunch of similar shows that have been drawing audiences so guess they figured to go with another one almost identical it showing an audience rating of 8 5 and that bizarre when many really good shows struggle to get 6 and 7 not to say it won happen but they truly should not return it for another season ', ' had high hopes as love many marvel films truly didn know they had it in them to make such bad movie it basically jumps from one purposeless action scene to another each bringing even less to the story than the last almost every character feels fake especially the parents and the villain for no reason the parents as well as yelena start speaking with heavy russian accent even though you see at the start of the movie they are perfectly capable of speaking american english this adds to the feeling that everything is fake and doesn hold up the movie sometimes tries to be emotional but fails miserably every time on the plus side yelena is funny character you could watch 3 minute extract of her funny scenes and save yourself the time ', ' am very happy very happy to watch pakistani characters in marvel universe perfect dubbing using pure pakistani words it just amazing to watch pakistani characters with urdu dubbed about series great story with the new hero marvel character ', ' some found it way too brutal and some find too much drama in it some of them were just some butt hurt americans who were giving bad reviews it does get little slow in the middle but picks up in the end those who are complaining about more frank than punisher this feels like setting up the character with him dealing with the past self maybe in the next season we will see more of the punisher in all good watch kept me wanting for more ', ' this series is so stupid that the stupidity has taken form with it ', ' boy really wanted to like the marvels which opened yesterday but didn it was chaotic jumbled and arbitrary assumed way more knowledge of backstory than reasonable tried too hard for unearned sentiment and featured wooden performance from nominal star brie larson it was not redeemed by its one brilliant touch the use of the song memory during the main hypercat scenes know that superhero stories are nominally science fiction because they re supposed to portray things that could really happen in the real world without use of magic or divinity if we re willing to grant them couple of wild cards such as the assumption that we ve been able to figure out faster than light travel and m ok with couple anything more than that and we re dealing with fantasy this one was way too fantastic and don mean that in good way ', ' like superhero shows was expecting stargirl potentially maybe geared more towards somewhat younger audience but this it was cheesy m not sure what exactly got roped into watching can only assume this is children show it not all bad but it not good mean not as superhero show and not for anyone not tween guess would call this children show that has superhero in it think lot of my annoyance is that it a marvel show but it not clearly labeled as disney children programming and just don know what m watching is this really supposed to be children programming is this supposed to be real marvel show what is this it had its ok moments but overall it was just not good as superhero show and felt like nickelodeon kids programming ', ' hard to call this movie good or bad its filled with typical marvel plotholes and clich moments and dialogs that make this movie annoying in half of time story it self had potential but it hit the ground of flattening it so it could be digested by sadly lowered average iq of modern viewer acting just like pacing and action scenes is mixed bag they tried to push weird jokes in too much scenes fighting is average at best because of lower quality animations for marvel movies you get lots of weird fights and movements some scenes are totally useless or overexposed to point that you get cringed by it its not really that bad but because of those plotholes hit and miss jokes and fighting its hard to call good movie it really feelt like one of those action movies that you watch on tv in boring saturday in the middle of day ', ' lost interest in the series way back in season 2 and just for the heck of it decided to watch the finale what waste of time ', ' this movie is really good ignore all of the troll reviews enjoyed this movie lot it also made me super hyped for endgame if you haven seen this movie you should see it as soon as you can ', ' that this is the best superhero series of all time is no debate but for me it is also the best series ever maybe prison break oder breaking bad are better but that for me personally opinion which series you like more but this is masterpiece maybe there is one superhero which is better than daredevil namely the dark knight but when only one of the best movies of all time is better than this series have to be masterpiece hope we will see charlie cox as daredevil again ', ' iman vellani stole the show her infectious essence was palpable and she helped carry the movie the marvels wasn bad by any means but her light shined bright the wifey and truly enjoyed it and we geeked over the mid and end credits so very good so don believe these other who rated it so low what do these guys expect it isn avengers endgame nor was it expected to be at the same time though it isn thor love and thunder either it a good movie that will bring you good fun you ll laugh you ll have some action throwing your way and you may even shed tear it simply good movie so go expecting to have fun and you ll have that ', ' really enjoyable and visually beautiful film with strong female character what wrong about that please go and see this film ', ' it was good movie but lot of it could have been better and it should have came out 5 years ago great intro ', ' just about 6 stars was flashed from the beginning but as many other series with too many episodes in too many seasons also this one gets worse by every season couldn even finish the last one it got so incredibly dumb and aaaaaall those repeatedly boring iterations of the same problems wished jon favreau would have been the show runner ', ' think kamala khan being fan girl doesn mean her having motivation of becoming superhero it isn deep enough for me many marvel hardcore people argue that she is just teenager yes understand that she is teenager and lives in world where multiple generations of heros have emerged many have fallen like the avengers are almost dismantled and new generation of super heros are coming up and there is no need of super tragic story for young person so that he she can think dream of becoming super hero but what they don understand is the pressure of being super hero you need to make lot of decisions and some of them could be bad for people but still you do it because there is no option and hoping it will do greater good and as she is teenager and doest knowhow to deal with stuff why give her such power to begin with what mean is in the comics she had in human abilities like making her hands big which is ok with me as she would have grown up with it and get adjusted with it and naturally become superhero villan neither based on her choice but in this show marvel changed her powers and now she has magic bracelets which is not good because that too powerful for her and she isn used to superpowers and especially magic powers are very dangerous as you can see with wanda basically to sum what am saying is if she is fangirl teenager then she neither has the motivation nor the experience to be super hero but she is because marvel decided so it just doesn make sense and another thing that want to mention is that ms marvel was actually male character then suppose it would be mr marvel and also not teenager int he original comics then as time passes the ms marvel title has been changed to different characters about 4 or 5 then it finally passes on to kamala khan basically kamala khan is copy of copy of copy etc the other characters just took the title without even mentioning that it belonged to someone else before just my opinion why take ms marvel to be live show out of all the other cool characters that marvel could have taken from the comics think the only literal reason is to pair her up with captain marvel in the upcoming marvel movie and don have much expectations for that movie either captain marvel is jus soulles power house and also doest have any reason motivation to kick everyone who we thought were strong except that she thinks she have full down many times due to being woman which she did not that amount of suffering is normal for most of the people throught their lives and also the reason she is powerful even with nonsenaible motivation is because marvel decided so ', ' so to start of wouldn say the movie is particular bad or good it is ok the question now becomes is ok enough for 200 million dollar disney production that plays out like it was made for 4 part series on disney not movie my answer would be not really the movie started abit slow and the story was not all that interesting the vfx as usual in the mcu movies was good but you know it will be and expect that in time where you have shows movies with similiar production value on netflix and disney with no extra cost this movie costs 30 usd in addition to the subscription on disney this just falls short for me to the people that rated this movie 8 or higher ask would you have rated it as high if you strip out the marvel name and rename the characters with no change to story or writing or anything but the names truly don think so if they had made this into 4 8 part show on disney plus wouldn probably say ok its not worse than the falcon and the winter soldier but also not better but as movie it just falls short for me as it is ', ' its funny because so many are giving reviews of 1 3 stars but whats suspicious is 90 of them have only reviewed just black widow movie or maybe 1 other movie watch it and judge for yourself im life time marvel fan and though taskmaster wasnt exactly like the comics at all but it shouldnt take away from the movie itself then theirs these guys all complaining about female empowerment movies lol and when check their reviews 2 of them reviewed birds of prey another female movie captain marvel female movie and black widow with 1 2 stars clearly they are upset women are getting more of push the funniest review saw had someone complaining that it has men shown as evil pigs or whatever and thats why he hated the movie lol but lets be real in the comics 90 of the villains are males so what they cryin about another complained black widow wasnt using her beauty and sexy charm to seduce charm her enemies but like cmon you know how much backlash could occur if the directors went on that direction suddenly many would complain its sexist or such historical manly views on women their trying to change things from the comics cause the comics was all written back then during different era in how things were example being all characters mostly were white or females with busty hourglass bodies dressed in revealing outfits etc marvel and dc is now in new era and thus their are kany changes from the comics ', ' am quite embarrassed with the movie like thank god didn watch it in imax 3d yes acting is neutral scarlet johansson and gal gadot has benchmark the female super hero movies the only thing pray is captain marvel down kill thanos it will be the biggest mistake marvel will commit absolute blunder there is no wow moment comic timing is average but carol denvers doesn have it in her brei larson is one of the worst addition to avengers world ', ' gave ms marvel 4 stars to start with as realised it might not be my ideal mcu series but they typically get better had to revise my rating to 1 it just got more boring and less mcu like as it progressed sorry not even close mcu standard d take eternals any day over this ', ' know it a stand alone movie but that is bit of an understatement you simply don need to have watched any other marvel movies to watch this it a typical good action movie nothing bad but nothing excellent they tried very hard to inject some humour but feel as though the jokes were very rushed one thing was disappointed with especially with the extra time they have had due to the multiple covid delays was the cgi honestly the falcon and winter soldier had better effects than this full blown movie good but not for marvel movie ', ' where to start me and my wife watched this movie yesterday to forget about the drama called battleship don get me started but it hard to choose the most retarded movie between the two this one had some okay jokes in it but like many people said you don feel any threat you don feel any story you just see special effects and uhmerica yaa 2hrs straight the effects were good and the hulk smashed like he never smashed before but every movie starts sucking as soon as you realize nobody of the good guys can actually die lord of the rings anyone and when legions of 10x more bad ass alien monsters are killed throwing chair at them or blind aimed headshotting them with bow on spaceship going 300mph you know you re just wasting your time anybody with the very least amount of self respect stay away from this movie how this garbage achieved to get 8 6 on imdb is more entertaining for me than watching that movie says lot about imdb and what it has become compared to what it used to be ', ' have been huge mcu fan for as long as can remember one of my earliest memories of watching movies as kid was seeing the first iron man in theaters as 10 year old and thinking this was the coolest thing have ever seen up until now have seen every single marvel instalment within the first week of release and watched every episode of every new series no matter how diverse or not for me it was some titles especially recently enjoyed less but still finished due to my pure love for the mcu and for fomo of missing out on call back to show movie didn watch and missing out tried to watch 3 times over months each time telling myself im sure its not as bad as remember and still even with my devotion of watching every single marvel project so never miss anything couldnt get through it simply put didnt disslike it thought it was truly unbearable ', ' as it turns the post credit scene we get at the very end is the only exciting and good scene in the whole series worst story direction action sequences acting and the cgi as well there literally nothing good about it had to skip through episodes to complete the series unbearable boring as hell ', ' don know what everyone is griping about this was great film lots of action and lots of heart with the heart really making the film this for me was right up there with ca winter soldier and both some of marvels best offerings ', ' the punisher resembles shooter ex military man gets beaten up shot by bulletts and arrows the he limps during five minutes then he climbs walls jumps fences etc oh yes there is an obligatory almost faithfull wife who suffers also poor dialogues poor acting ', ' it common to see paid mercenaries to either burn movie or to boost its rating this is what happens here the movie is good very entertaining and with lot of funny moments definitely worth watch the first 25 minutes are little slow but it pays of later ignore the haters go and you will enjoy yourself cinema was created for movies like this fun entertaining light plus it puts you in the driver seat for the big avengers movie ', ' daredevil is absolutely amazing the cast the story the plot the action everything in that show is perfect 10 charlie cox has portrayed the hero perfect vincent onofrio also has done fantastic job and have two questions 1 why daredevil hasn already joined the avengers 2 why in the name of god was this show cancelled ', ' the avengers is the most fun crowd pleasing movie ve seen in years its no wonder marvel the avengers shattered the box office record with over 200 000 000 dollars domestic this weekend it barely been out and its made half billion dollars the avengers has been around for about 50 years and after 5 movies leading up to this the avengers delivers the theater was mad house when saw it saturday there were little kids and old people as well this movie is great for all ages the older people finally get to see the super heroes they grew up with finally on the big screen and the little kids will get great role models to look up to the movie puts great emphasis on how teamwork results in victory the character development is great each superhero gets enough screen time but the hulk steels the show and is sure to be everyone favorite the best moments in the movie are when the hulk is on screen they did good job on showing how captain america assumed the leader position on the team iron man tony stark is witty as always and thor is also cool the team is balanced and everyone even puny hawk eye and black widow contributes this movie has it all great action character development comedy and story it can be little cheesy but in good way there are moments when the whole theater will laugh clap and cheer its fun way to start off summer know m picking this up as soon as it hits the shelves along with spiderman 2 and dark knight the avengers is one of the best superhero movies to date can wait for number 2 ', ' wow what dud the writing is horrible could care less about any of these characters ', ' the first season was good and made enjoyable viewing second season was over acted and ridiculous which brought my rating down it better than the awful jessica jones though ', ' wonder what brought the people who voted 3 to 0 starts to be so mad ', ' this movie was so much fun the chemistry between the leading ladies brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani was amazing the moment they all were on screen together it just perfect ms marvel family stole the show so many laughs great fight sequence and ending and after credits scene hope it gets those who didn watch ms marvel excited about watching her show which is also good fun show ve watched many movie that got low reviews and they re known as classics today it wasn perfect but it was just good time and definitely plan on seeing it again go see the movie and judge for yourself ', ' once again this demonstrates marvel studio hacks getting hold of characters good ideas and destroying them marvel once again shows that dc animated is far superior in it tales character portrayals and it action sequences even when it doing daft episodes if this movie was aimed at 5 year olds or younger could accept it and leave it alone unfortunately it not it going to be watched by fans of the subject matter the actors do good job with the horrific script and dialogue they have to work with the problem is that the comedy is too slap stick for making the characters likeable or realistic these are meant to be late teens early twenty characters not 9 12 year old characters they all come off as characters from clueless not real people ', ' so disappointed with marvel with releasing such less than average series acting is bad storyline makes no sense some scenes don even make sense not fan at all of this marvel series don waste your time on it ', ' the first episode sets the tone for fresh lighthearted and pretenseless show with bold imaginative style the cinematography is outstanding even for marvel standards and the animations that blend into the surroundings are nice touch it really feels like teen show but not in 90s 00s way not like pretentious gen show that trying too hard to cater to its audience and as 35 year old millennial may not be the target audience but didn feel like it wasn for me the writing is not amazing or anything but as work of escapist entertainment it perfect it fun it wholesome and most of all it different m hooked ', ' wow can think of any words about this it was so awesome very scary and brutal just like daredevil except for the scary part of course krysten ritter was spectacular as jessica jones and loved luke cage killgrave was an awesome villain and the story was excellent much better than the shitty teen age drama on the cw network like arrow and flash after watching the first episode was so amazed watched 4 more episodes in row each episode is about an hour or so which is awesome can wait for more stuff from marvel like luke cage and iron fist hopefully just watch it now now but watch daredevil first if you haven already ', ' as we all know by now the punisher has been dumped after season 2 by netflix both series won appeal to everyone and some may find it far to violent and dark especially season 2 where the action really kicks in sadly though much like so many other series across all v platforms that offer something little different it prematurely been kicked in to touch the first season was very much the setup for the second season season 1 could be little slow but it needed the story told in season 1 to make season 2 work season 2 is faster paced and has far more action lots will say it too violent but never got feeling that people were being killed for the sake of gore each person who ended on the wrong side of the punisher either deserved it or it help build the back story and mental turmoil he goes through the introduction of two stories in season 2 that don have any link at the start but see the punisher fighting on two fronts works well without giving any spoilers away did feel there was room to explore the back story better of john pilgrim who was an excellent addition john bernthal plays the punisher beautifully and there is very much plenty to enjoy about his punisher full stop it a shame for now it has had to end at least the end of season 2 plays out to suitable finish if there indeed is not another season to come on another platform great show and highly recommend ', ' like the show no doubt in that so start to watch the show and all these crazy gadgets start coming up and mean could really believe but flying car really mean that is too future stuff and it too soon to expose and the guy is right some things are better behind doors but one has gotta say this is thriller maybe little hope that it will improve want it too be it almost too easy like in the cartoons and comics they have to bring up some reality otherwise this show is dead and really mean it the old was good and so was the young agent tough m sad about mike death he wanted to be hero but think that he had it coming he had to pay the cost wish the best of luck to the agents ', ' poorly written dialogs where everyone speaks without ever actually saying anything more than clich characters and story all of it hidden by saturated colors the show looks good can deny it and on screen textos drawings because of course they re gonna put textos and drawings everywhere the main character is rebellious 16 years old m gonna change the rating and edit the review if the show gets better but considering what has done to the mcu lately doubt it ', ' did research about the character understand why the character was created am okay with the character as whole the opening intro was bad not creative comparing to other marvel show and movie the show was not funny bad at explaining shock culture to western and eastern culture too much motion graphic on scenes that are not important worst use of the weekend songs kamala is very rebellious and careless about other the actress do not fit kamala she is too old and don have nonverbal behavior as teenager kamala in the show hate her heritage and culture unsure whether this is made for muslim kids in s only the parent is not as strict as you think they make lot of compromise for kamala and let her boy friend in the house the use of music and principle of photography is very bad the show seem like it was made by group of people that don know or don love the character the pilot pilot episode failed to capture new or regular fan and audience don watch it may be wait and watch when all 6 episodes when it come out ', ' yep it true mcu did an average film rather unnecessary not engaging and full of stereotypes ', ' it essentially children movie that been padded out for adults ve never liked the comics and this is just special effects showcase the fact captivate so many audience members is worrying statement on how juvenile society has become ', ' this is probably one of the best marvel tv show have seen however there is some flaws throughout three seasons season 1 was really good on introducing the character to the viewers season 2 was where the problems started season 2 was not as good the story was not really well written season 2 felt like it was trying to advertise other tv shows lot of the story plot was to promote the show defenders and the punisher season 3 was great but would say season 1 is the best out of all however there were few problems like repetitive story but still it was great season 2 was the main problem thats why its an 8 ', ' have seen so far four episodes of agents of shield and look mix of michael knight kit the new series and gi joe in my opinion only two characters are given some credibility to the series are clark greg and ming na wen the rest of the characters need some building in order to make them more credible the action scenes are poorly made and not at all convincing but curiously find myself watching the all the episodes perhaps waiting to see if the characters get any better the story get better or at least more interesting either the series gets more interesting during the second half the first season or ll be expecting cancellation on the way ', ' it a basic scenario ok but is the acting good meh average the best part is the interaction between the punisher and micro it not bad but it could be so much better ', ' gave it 1 just for using the name ayesha khuda ki lanat the girl kamala is ok marvels should really hire lots of writers try to make something like o long lasting and which can be carried on for 8 9 years ', ' pointless movie disney content with continuous bleeding the industry dry the movie industry in horrible place at the moment ', ' love now in the mcu we are seeing the expansion of culture kamala is fun unique sweet kind of spazz and endearing her family is very tight nit and it shows how well the writer put the time into explaining and exploring her culture love her daydreaming montages because it goes into comic book mode this show has made me smile 2 in and cannot wait for the rest ', ' it an amazing film to watch with family and friends loved the series the cast and crew have done spectacular job this new form of mcu in series format has really entrapped many non mcu viewers and as an mcu fan it delighting to see the good response including moonknight etc ', ' sure there are parts of this are pretty bad but the action sequences are good and it is pretty funny at times ', ' extremely boring until the last 30 minites was falling asleep halfway through the movie dont get how this movie made money one line zingers here and there don make this movie good ', ' the coming of age television series ms marvel follows kamala khan as she learns about both her past and her newfound powers while most attempts at fusing two cultures have come off as forced or naive ms marvel seamlessly fuses the two the show was able to shine light on different cultures and communities while still adhering to the larger mcu fanbase the set and costume designers as well as the directors did fantastic job of bringing to life kamala home and community iman vellani as kamala khan was bubbly fun character to follow and the supporting cast welded around her well unfortunately ms marvel does suffer from the same issues plaguing its counterpart shows as the 6 episode structure forces the ending to be quite rushed the villain arc was also rather underwhelming however overall the show still puts front compelling and fun arc for kamala khan and introduces her thoroughly to the broader mcu ', ' the character the character depiction and the plot are too good the cinematography the fight scenes and being honest with the violence does pretty good justice to them was disappointed with marvel universe for thor ragnarok but the punisher made up for it had high hopes from frank castle after his appearance in daredevil which was super awesome too in my opinion and the series more than lived up to it nothing to add here steve lightfoot please give us the same if not better season 2 ', ' the acting and storyline is aimed at those who do not know the shared history of the indian subcontinent there is lot of cultural appropriation going on with india cuisine and items being typecast as those from the pakistani side overtly dramatic acting from the cast breaks the marvel universe themes the movie does not include any reference to east pakistan now bangladesh which seems to be odd as the partition tore up the country into three parts resulting in millions being displaced killed and much worse the bollywood songs being used may also be bit over the top it does not seem like the creators actually cared about what constitutes local regional differences ', ' in every superhero movie there is formula which makes us come back to watch them time and again hero ine is challenged suffers through adversity comes out stronger on the other side quotes like can do this all day and why do we fall down bruce so we can learn to pick ourselves up follow that trend ms marvel has no real adversity she wants to be superhero she dreams of it kids are mean to her in school but she has friends and loving family her parents bit strict but nothing unusual then one day she gets superpowers it is early on in the season but considering her role model had similar origin story where nothing was at stake and she had no real challenges expect the same will be done here this will just be story of her getting superpowers and how weird that is maybe she will fight crime like spiderman but am getting disney kids feel to the story and that isn great kate bishop had agency and challenges the stakes were high for her family that is why it worked so gave this episode 1 star wasn engaged or enthused by what saw am not review bombing the show am giving my opinion disney bots and marketing teams will do their best to spin off similar bad reviews as toxic fandom but that isn true it is fandom saying they don like what you did the comics kamala kahn was excellent because marvel hasn let me down hope sincerely my other reviews will be better for her show if not then guess am just part of the toxic fandom who felt that with the billions of dollars disney makes off mcu they could have done more or better with this program and given her the story she deserves ', ' do not write reviews don think have ever written one before there is not much care strongly enough about to put my opinion out there daredevil is good enough to break my 21 year silence the pacing is spectacular the twists are truly surprising and the writing and the acting and the costume designers etc are fantastic had never read the comic books as with many of marvels recent ventures but this absolutely makes me want to have heard people calling it marvels version of the dark knight in tone and aesthetics it does hold many similarities the dark atmosphere and gore are 180 to the films that marvel has recently produced it is different version of marvel that those who follow the pop culture of marvel have not yet seen and it is done with as much spectacular commitment and soul as what we have come to expect from marvel it is fantastic and strongly recommend it to anyone who likes superheroes action or good shows ', ' the show plot is fine nothing spectacular but fine the cast of the show is what makes or breaks it and in this case one character singlehandedly breaks it skye the hot computer hacker chick who always on her phone who only there for teenage girls to relate to or for teenage boys to fantasize over sucks the life out of an otherwise decent cast of characters coulson is great fitz simmons are charming ward gives off poor man superman vibe and may is solid the avengers tie ins are few and far between when they are made they usually seem half baked and only there for brand recognition anyway if skye eventually gets written out of the script may start watching again ', ' the cgi is hilarious but these are two oscar nominees lmao how do they get those terrible line readings out of oscar contenders the third act its an absolute joke for me m sorry ', ' ve liked agents of shield but this last season seems to be bit off track added to that some of the storylines seem to borrow from previous shows that joss whedon was involved in especially angel that is elements of the stories closely resemble elements of stories from angel ', ' this show may not be the best marvel has to offer but somehow it sucks me in and won let go she is sad and angry most of the time but it sort of feels like real life crap in strange and distorted way ', ' this movie looks like it cost lot but it was horribly horribly written and rarely notice that in movie other than yelena this movie was total dud ', ' turned this show off halfway through the second episode ms marvel in general and kamala in particular is an assault on the senses every scene finds new ways to become more pedantic dull or just plain bad talk about budget marvel clearly very little time was spent on casting graphics plot or script development the only redeeming quality could possibly be the cinematography we get it the character is pakistani muslim unfortunately instead of bridging the gap between pakistani culture and american culture marvel tales every opportunity to shove ms marvel into ethnic stereotype ostracized from the rest of american culture on top of that kamala absolutely abysmal acting aside there is no attempt to develop her as person she doesn work at all to get her powers she just receives random bracelet sent from her grandma and then there no questions asked marvel has habit of doing this recently of expecting their audience to go for increasingly ridiculous ideas without explanation no attempt whatsoever to bring the audience along m done with this show assuming it gets better would only be because it couldn actually get any worse ', ' forgettable is the best word can use to describe this movie marvel is universe with marvels and misguided attempts capt marvel but this feel somewhere in between the characters weren engaging the story meh and action was mostly the same we ve find to see didn dislike it but will likely never give it another watch ', ' vincent onforio is the only reason was able to keep watching this serial he awesome and actually seems to be the hero of season 1 with the joker heroes girl huge unwanted hindrance to success season 1 episode 11 complete disaster ', ' it hard to believe that anyone can be portrayed so incapable to learn from her own mistakes and circumstances useless super hero whose only real power is her boundless arrogance and complete inability to take any responsibility for her own actions and decisions blaming others for her own guilt and utmost incometence in every aspect of life every time jessica says ll take care of it feel like laughing because that a sure sign of another coming failure more tragic and unnecessary deaths around her and more reasons for drinking and coming up with new even more idiotic plans she keeps seeing as genious well done if the show is for the brainless ', ' the writing was lazy and disjointed you can tell there was different director for each episode found iman acting to be amateur compared to her co stars she can play up quirky well but lacks the ability to portray sincerity in the heavier scenes the antagonists were one dimensional and dry the history lesson and peeks into muslim and pakistani culture were delightful and the only aspect of this show that worked this would ve done better as coming of age story of young american pakistani woman rather than super hero origin story the family and friends were the true stars of every scene not kamala ', ' it has few good moments but come on it supposed to be super hero show but instead we spend 85 of the show examining muslim culture it completely misses the point of being fun and full of action instead it wants to woke and culturally aware what its super hero show jeepers you re missing the point why can it just be far fetched super hero show why can it just be cute and fun instead it delivering complete obvious subversive message about muslim life and culture it sad that something can just be fun anymore ', ' don see why people are after this rotten stuff few days back was looking into this review everyone was praising this and the rating was way too high for this low class series somehow was keen to look for myself after watching the first 3 episodes was like ah ah no way it a big no from me there is no catchy storyline average acting skills and way overrated poor casting weak storyline and watching it brings boardem for sure wish can give it zero stars not recommended at all don just waste your precious time after this boring series ', ' am firm believer that every film should be able to stand on its own this was heavy action packed movie the fight scenes were well choreographed and the cgi was well done the script cast some stellar characters with interesting backgrounds in theory this movie should have been tailored to my liking unfortunately spent the first half of the movie dead bored and wondering how much was left what this film lacked was character we didn see any depth of character it doesn matter that the actors or actress showed great facial expressions reactions their character was never explored beyond that they remained flat personable characters and yes did read the arguments all over the internet that what the other movies were for they showed character go watch those this leads me back to my first statement it doesn matter if it already been done in preceding movie expect to be wowed in this movie to me this movie came off as melodramatic was the wrong audience for this film recommends it for marvel fans action superhero genre fans ', ' have watched several films that span across many different categories and time frames everything from the absolute greatest to the all time worst rated films in my honest opinion believe that the movie is far from perfection but definitely in the 9 range superhero film like this calls for tons of action and excitement and this movie delivers on every level and then some wonderful cast made it seem believably true rock hard culmination of protagonists and antagonists in cooperation to fight the good fight against an unruly evil even if you were attending just to see one superhero you would still get kick from the others in the bunch they were all at the top of their game in this film and there was not single head in the audience that was not sitting at the edge of their seat in amazement excellent cast great dialogue wonderful camera shots for the action scenes and trust me there were plenty of action scenes to go around several fights going on at the same time so if you were disappointed with one fight you can eagerly await as the camera approached another fight scene and it was constant battle to the very end if there is one superhero film you should watch it this one and if you don feel like watching it in the theatres now at least be open minded to pick copy up when it releases on blu ray dvd ', ' everything is timed so perfectly the length of cable is perfect from the helicopter in reality they could rehearse it 35 times and still have not succeeded but in the movie they randomly do anything and everything succeeded and yes the bomb would explode about 0 5 second the lady flee the scene every single time this movie is ok for the action to look at but the storyline is pretty weak right about the movie is released there were some people online saying it was great movie it was fantastic movie it felt little bit like some people were paid to say that or that some people who were related to the movie or if they own disney stocks were saying that if they do that it is betrayal to the audience like iron man lot more ', ' literally had hard time staying awake brie larson was awful green lantern was more exciting and believable than brie in this movie the best parts of this movie were watching fury and phil in their younger versions the movie would have been 10 000 better if it was only about these two characters as the main protagonists with literally any other plot ', ' calling this an action flick almost feels like treason while the action it has is very high octane and avenger ish the scenes are scarce when compared to the thick melodrama emphasized by an exaggerated sad music twista are abound once or twice and insane predictable for anyone with half brain unfortunately was looking forward to an origin story movie for natasha romanoff but instead we get family drama with more focus on her little sister character and an allegory of the patriarchy the biggest saving grace aside from the action when present is the comedy scattered throughout which as in any marvel movie can be quite hit or miss but in this one they mostly landed for me m also big fan of david harbour so that helped ', ' no matter how interesting the plot line seems it becomes dull boring and illogical after point if you are fan of sherlock benedict cumberbatch and expecting similar show than this series is huge disappointment for starters the lead in the role is private investigator and former superhero but the detective part of the character is so weak that the sherlock seems big superhero in front of jessica and she isn a good super hero as her abilities aren captivating or interesting she seems so normal that when she is being defeated by villain she is so weak but than in every super hero story the villain is always stronger than the hero but here for the most silly reasons the villain slips away mean at point you start to think there are so many ways to catch villain but she couldn and lastly the characters in the story are being pulled and inserted without logic and connection its better to watch true detective again that to watch this ', ' compared to this thor love and thunder is masterpiece the scene of the dance looks like something come out from the mind of mel brooks to ridiculize that the mcu has been acquired by disney some of the few good ideas in the script are destroyed by abominable scenes can accept the everyday suits but the pijama are too much even for moment like this where the presumed normality must be part of every movie every tv show everything yes understood the message and guys it wrong or maybe this is not the way the mcu can only get better hope that this is the lower level reachable ', ' ll admit it was extremely doubtful about this film ve loved joss whedon work my entire life and had enjoyed all the previous marvel films that led up to this one especially iron man but the fact that they brought together all of these different characters from all these different movies and put them together in 2 1 2 hour film was unprecedented and almost seemed impossible but the optimist in me got me to the theater with me expectations shaky once the film started was quickly drawn in and once the title appeared on the screen knew that joss whedon had done it the avengers is without doubt my favorite marvel film and even my favorite action film ever made whedon did great job writing this masterful witty script that ingeniously put together all these characters and made it flow perfectly the actors did such great job playing these characters again and it didn seem like anyone was underutilized and everyone got chance to be in the spotlight especially the hulk once you see all of the characters assemble and fight the bad guys you can help but fill with happiness the entire movie was such fun thrill ride from the beginning to the end and the ending battle scene was brilliantly done am extremely delighted to say that joss whedon has done the impossible and made one of the most entertaining movies ever made ', ' ray winstone the cockney russian worst accent ever why does nobody tell them that they are crap millions of pounds spent and nobody noticed and don get me started on the diversity quota russia that beautiful country known for its massive density of people of colour literally at the end of the film the majority of widows are black or some other ethnic minority it idiotic ', ' story revolves around daredevil and villain kingpin daredevil man with ethics and pride try to save his city with his supernatural abilities totally convincing other side villain perfectly suits actor he has extreme intelligence and no mercy for who comes to his paln to take over his city ', ' ummm well this series does not look like in the comic btw this is just for kid and the moon knight is better than this one ', ' extremely bad and very boring show those of you hoping to see real carol danvers ms marvel show this is not it disney is really going downhill recently ', ' when learned we were finally getting black widow movie but the first trailer had me skeptical m not going to lie and then watched the movie three times and am changed woman this movie has everything great action sequences fantastic musical score lovable characters that can wait to see again and yes lot of heart this was the female led superhero movie was waiting for and if you can make sure you check it out in imax it well worth the price of admission ', ' after first episode stopped watching it very cringe pakistani culture and average story is not something want to waste my time on marvel should stop playing with it brand and work on something better ', ' we started watching this with my boys 11 and 7 last fall it was borderline then on the violence and sex scale but still ok because it marvel and it cool not anymore this last episode on the train with the good guys trying to track secret case was so so violent and over the top stabbing in the back girl shot at close range twice with one shot where the gun is pressed against her belly while she is being hugged huge amounts of blood more stabbing open wounds then ridiculous amounts of blood follow this with talk of the two main characters having sex what is wrong with these producers this is marvel it supposed to be fun and for kids why would you do this to comic characters it not needed and you have ruined it for me and my family and from what have read for many other families also please don watch this show with young children or you will be sorry ', ' maybe slightly below average for an avenger movie but still pretty good thanks to florence pugh character ', ' the movie was great it has lot of cool fight scenes and the fact that they made cat main character is amazing can wait for avengers endgame ', ' it was surprise that actually liked marvel the avengers my expectations were film about bunch of superheroes exercising their powers for the sheer amusement of the comic book fans indeed was right about the exercise of power naturally enough but the way such showing off was employed is what like about the film while on the surface the events may seem to revolve about group of mentally immature superheroes there are several references to deeper meaning presented in hilarious light way with focus on both action and dialogue alike the undertone found in the avengers has to do with the current universal trend of freedom and rebels loki makes it clear that his purpose is to fix the problem which earth inhabitants have of misunderstanding the meaning of freedom claiming they are made to be ruled also there is an indirect mention of fallen regimes in general and particularly the fall of the soviet union though this subject is not dealt with depth it gives some weight to the light nature of the film film about superheroes is not expected to tackle serious issues but at the same time films whose main aim is to entertain the viewer should still not be an embodiment of triviality as is the case in many comedies of the last few years this is delivered through balance between action and dialogue the film is action packed like superhero film should be though this does not come at the expense of dialogue action sequences are supported by the amazing cgi with special nod to the resemblance between dr banner and the hulk dialogue similarly plays an important role in the development of events and the relationship between the characters wittily this is coated with fair amount of good humour though some jokes could be predictable the spontaneity of the performances makes them unarguably funny for example towards the end when rogers is giving orders to policemen what follows is pretty predictable but the spontaneity of the policeman made viewers laugh despite themselves non verbal humour even mounts to point when viewers clapped hard when dr banner other guy shut loki up with slight movement of his huge arms such elements gather in the end to make film that successfully transcends the circle of comic book fans delivering one of the best films of the season ', ' after all the hundreds of action movies saw balanced movie among all the other avengers action melted with intelligent ideas plus fair dramatic scenes not amazing but unexpected fair script with logical steps flashback at last was focused without wondering putting the scenario together ', ' to keep this short love this movie all of the characters are amazing and the actors playing these characters are also doing an amazing job of really capturing the way these characters should be portrayed think that robert downey jr as iron man was great casting choice as he is able to show the loving and caring side of tony stark and also the cocky arrogant and snarky side of him chris hemsworth as thor was also amazing some of the lines that he had with the other avengers were amazing and hemsworth is good at making it seem as though thor has no idea why humans do what they do chris evans as steve rodgers was somewhat save for the actors marvel career as the last time he appeared in marvel movie he played the human torch in the very disappointing fantastic four movies he also does very good at acting as though he from the 1940 all of the other performances were outstanding but the one that stands out is tom hiddleston as loki he was compelling villain intimidating and funny at times overall think the movie is all around amazing and is definitely my favourite mcu movie so far ', ' have loved scarlett johansson black widow since the classic interrogation scene in iron man 2 have looked forward to seeing this unfortunately it does not live up to the hyped up expectations the set up is long and drawn out in protracted opening where nothing happens until an explosion and fight over the magic potion mcguffin the strongest feature of the movie is the introduction of florence pugh as the pseudo sister pugh poking at widow is relentless especially with the running poser gag cool way to die etc the dynamic between johansson and pugh works well but the dysfunctional pretend family is strained and unnatural ray winstone is cast as ray winstone with terrible russian accent and is absent throughout don get me started on the pheromones nonsense although widow solution to this is hilarious sad to say this is travesty of what could and should have been fabulous movie ', ' instead of going with fresh story we got rotten fisk again was afraid he would be brought back in 2nd season but alas 3rd season here we see him again not surprised they ended on 3rd season ', ' liked season 1 and 2 but loved season 3 even more because it had such good story to it even though season 1 and 2 did but this was even better ', ' m not claiming this movie is in any way great example of what marvel can produce but must say it was better than was expecting brie larson was not nearly as cardboard as she was in the first captain marvel film and so that was an obvious improvement iman vellani was by far the best part of the film both in terms of her enthusiasm and dialogue she elevated the film and seemed to bring everyone along with her teyonah paris and zawe ashton both were adequate in their respective roles although the latter as dar ben seemed one dimensional and once again showed marvel weakness in providing fleshed out antagonists for their movies it wasn that zawe was in any way bad as dar ben but rather that the character was merely there to push the plot forward plot that was thinner than most and added very little to the overall universe that is the marvel 616 it unfortunate because it seems as though the movie merely paid lip service to ideas it had been developing in both previous movies and the streaming series from disney the kree skrulls and saber all are merely cheap plot devices masquerading as flavor to spice the movie the supporting cast was adequate samuel jackson as fury post secret invasion seemed little bit out of sync with where we left him but people who didn watch it will likely not notice anything the vfx as always were spot on and the movie looked great the planets and locations were colorful even if some of the ideas presented seemed bit far fetched just let it go and turned my brain off overall it was fun ish movie but if you re looking for that old marvel vibe and excitement you re liable to be let down bit and the ending credit stingers revealed future promises that seem so far out of reach right now that they might as well not have put them in at all know it sounds like overall m dogging the movie but do think in the final balance that the movie is better than it was worse it certainly was an improvement on the first captain marvel movie but didn see anything that made me really cheer the film it merely was the next thing in the long line of movies that seem to be leading us in many directions marvel needs to tighten up their ideas bit more flesh out their villains stop hinting at big picture that too complicated and start to make movie that don rely on dozen other things to work without 3 streaming series and several movies this movie will make little sense and going back over everything briefly in flashback as form of exposition seems like it takes away from building movie that is fully fleshed out the marvels seems more like bridge to the next big thing d also point out that we now have several different seeming causes for the marvel multiverse which is weird see also loki spiderman no way home dr strange multiverse of madness m not sure why they seem to be breaking everything apart in different ways in various unrelated shows and movies but it odd because it creating cause and effect problem where m not sure what the cause is versus what the effects are of the mutiverse ', ' the marvels movie if you have felt like it the end of the world love brings light and light brings the beginning of new youniverse encourage every family every parent every child and every woman to go see truly magical movie the first marvel movie by disney in long while to express the family values of disney through work of love light awe and wonder guardians of the galaxy team up vibes propel us to the marvels of the universe as marvel goes truly intersteller don let the vibrant remine energy of this penultimate cinematic triumph discourage you lean into it take it on board expand your youniverse there something here for everyone and if you re man and you don see this film you ll miss out on the opportunity to get back in touch with your inner child this movie is like the first time that you experienced an exotic food years later that food is personal favourite ', ' the trailer of this movie was very cleverly made like click bait probably the trailer contain all the good scenes of the whole movie yes it bad one even compared to other mcu movies the script seems to be made in total lazyness based on couple of lines it like story should start at point and end at another point just mix some dialogues and special effects in the middle which is hugely disappointing for any mcu movie and the first black widow movie as well villian is big let down but when the whole movie is bs there not much to criticize florence pugh shines hopefully she ll get better script in future ', ' one of my favorite republic serials along with zorro fighting legion and spy smasher adventures of captain marvel is slick fast paced and action packed of course it has the usual failings of most serials low budget short shooting schedule few bumps and wrinkles along the way but if that bothers you you are probably one of those viewers who complain about the plots of jackie chan films frank coughlan jr does creditable work as billy batson while tom tyler stagecoach red river makes robust captain marvel fans of indiana jones will love this especially the sets in chapter one the best part about capt marvel is his occasional shortage of sense of fair play when was the last time you saw superman machine gun three guys in the back as they ran away this is one super hero who doesn play around also love tyler evil grin as bullets bounce off his chest and his propensity for pimp slapping the bad guys when they don answer his questions quickly enough also look for reed hadley zorro as one of the bad guys unmistakable due to his superb voice hadley narrated bomb training films for the us government and had high level security clearance for the job the other big plus of capt marvel is the ground breaking flying effects by the lydeckers using wires dummies reversed film and the leaping skills of stuntman dave sharpe if you love adventure serials you ll love the adventures of captain marvel highly recommended is the dvd release from artisan ', ' really enjoyed this movie love brie larson as captain marvel and wish we saw more of her in the mcu teyonah parris as monica rambeau and iman vellani as mrs marvel both got to really shine here slj as nick fury also got lot of spotlight here in the movie tons of character growth laugh out loud moments cool fight scenes what more can you want from an movie it was fun it was cute and it was really joyful truly loved this movie my wife and kids joined me and asked what each of them thought my wife also loved it my two daughters 9 and 5 really enjoyed it as well go see it you ll like it ', ' m marvel fan looki was my fav web series and tony stark was my fav character in mcu but now ms marvel aka kamala is my love what series ahh the folk music and avengers logo who would have thought that we will see partition in mcu love you directors amd kevin the most please make kamala more powerful ', ' one of the best crossover superhero movie have ever watched just one word for it masterpiece though saw many people giving it 4 10 or 5 10 in the review section let me tell same people gave justice league 10 1 ', ' this is the best series ever made by marvel and it is cancelled after three seasons it should be remaked and the acting of charlie cox aka matt murdock daredevil is amazing recommend to see this amazing series 1 ', ' but is the ultimate fan of joss whedon came to this film with virtually no background in the marvelverse so was bit confused at first my husband helped fill in the blanks by stopping the film when had questions but have to admit the script did good job of filling in the blanks minus few details this is an excellent film of its genre that incorporates everything special effects can do today with great character development courtesy of joss whedon who wrote and directed this blockbuster masterpiece do you know how rare it is to have blockbuster and masterpiece in the same sentence he has to know that at some level that he once again did the impossible he took what could have easily been disaster and he produced gold he created movie that was fun and exciting and shaped and brought cohesion to the marvel movie universe and gave each character their time to shine it has great acting quippy dialogue tons of very well done action and decent if underplayed level of ambiguity to the morality of the characters they worked individually they worked collectively it had lots of ultimate alliance moments hulk shoves piece of armor into the giant worm and thor hammers it into his head thor brings his hammer down on cap shield and causes huge shockwave thor shoots lightning at iron man and causes his suit to boost up to like 400 giving him supercharged shot love that all of those moments were added also love how joss had bunch of the heroes fight each other in way that made sense in the context of the movie thor vs hulk thor vs cap thor vs iron man hawkeye vs black widow black widow vs hulk you can help but love each and every fight will people still be talking about it 80 years from now the way they talk about citizen kane probably not but whedon accomplished in the 2010 in making film in which was completely engrossed for two and half hours had wonderful and fun time and wondered where the time had gone when the credits rolled and isn that why we go to the movies in the first place ', ' it was pretty apparent that this movie would descend condescend too wokeness given the director that helmed it cgi may have been used as cover for the poor writing and directing but ultimately the studio and producers put this worthless woe is me all women are victims pos in the chair deconstructionism is thoroughly destructive ', ' let me start off with that am big marvel fan and love the characters and the actors are amazing love the 1st season with the whole skye thing and everything and then they had little skye and grant romance and really shipped them still ship them btw then they made grant hydra and was like no but yes thinking they might make him good ish again hopping that skye and grant could get together but then they made him super bad into season 2 we then get the powers involved and only really started watching this show cause it was different and didn have supernatural people in it also the fact that it is marvel which then meant that started not so much liking the show at the start of season 3 thought they would stretch out simmons being in the other dimension little more but ehh it is now starting to get good again and am starting to get over skye and grant cause skye and lincoln are cute as k you can tell the director or who ever doesn want to get rid of brett dalton cause they have kept grant even though he is dead and cried when lance and bobbie left cause it was such sad ending see you kat ', ' is it ragnarok no it not it does spark joy though had great time seeing it in theater the mcu lovers need to get over the fact that not every movie is going to be banger in this universe the comic relief was bit over the top at times but it was driven by teenager so it probably tracks thought the marvel relationship was great good acting as the emotional moments did envoke feelings length of the movie was good kept the action going and didn draw out any character interactions overall great addition to the mcu ll happily watch this again and hope brie larson continues to get chance to bring her take on the character to the big screen ', ' by the title you can already tell how incredible think this show is every season brings something new to the table while maintaining its signature stylistic elements continuously blowing audiences away with their 10 minute one shot action sequences scenic lightings and breathtaking acting there are few shows where can safely say that every season was better than the last and daredevil is one of them charlie cox and the rest of the cast are absolutely incredible bringing so much depth and humanity to the characters laughed with them just as cried and raged with them and was convinced by each of their portrayals the score the acting and the script were phenomenal every one of these elements worked together to bring certain atmospheres to certain characters especially with ones like wilson fisk you get so drawn in by their performance and so invested in it all that you feel every emotion that they inflict on others ve never been more petrified of tv villain and more attached to tv hero if you can even call matt that be careful of the murdock boys they got the devil in em ', ' when first saw the ads was like what stupid looking costume it resembles the daredevil costume from the incredible hulk tv movie but as continued to watch it became quickly apparent to me that the costume was side issue to the excellent story lines and the great acting felt that every actor was carefully chosen for their role loved every character can say the same about any other superhero movie or tv show there usually someone feel was miscast found myself watching each episode and wanting to learn more about each character and how he or she fits into the daredevil universe big kudos to vincent donofrio for his portrayal of the kingpin didn think he could pull it off at first love charlie cox as matt murdock and the actor who played foggy was great too m just totally in love with the series and anxiously awaiting the second season oh think the red daredevil costume was little hokey looking but didn care because the story was so great kudos to the writers ', ' this seems to be good show however can handle the parents these people aren fit to have pets let alone children unfortunately there are millions of these parents out there and they re horrendous you give some people little power and they go nuts the mother waltzes into the kid bedroom and asks her what she doing she a total control freak and worthy of contempt regardless of what she thinks she doing the brother beard is absurd why would anyone want beard that long what the point it does not look good my beard is about an inch long and it looks great he looks like he should be bad guy in western ', ' the script was pretty good most of the cast is bad and they re pronunciation of russian is terrible the direction wasn the best either and if would ve to rate to movie by direction writing and cast it will be 2 4 2 ', ' the first two episodes of the punisher seemed promising but after that it just became clear that this show wasn my thing at all sat through the episodes of the first season though is the show about awesome america is it about how bad soldiers are treated after they get back from war is it about how soldiers love war is it about gun laws interesting themes for sure and the show picks them up more than franks revenge what the show should actually be about right but fails horribly at finding suitable arguments which leaves you wondering what they actually want to tell you it has great actors which lets me rate this 5 stars but plot wise the punisher lacks reasons for action and consequences character development and reasonable arguments for their trying to be political statements throughout the episodes it has violence just for the sake of it without any consequences for the character applying it plus the show runners really don have clue about medicine still can get over how stupid you have to be to disinfect your hands and then wipe them off on your pants before stitching someone up and why the heck would you burn wound you just stitched up ', ' it is the best thing and choice marvel has ever made its not blockbuster high budget like most of the mcu stuff nowadays but the amount of love poured into making this show is worth every second for us to watch we simply don deserve daredevil ', ' have been addicted to everything mcu since the beginning and watched all aos inhumans etc to make sure never missed anything this is the first time have not finished marvel show couldn even finish the first episode this is not for me it feels super woke and like what pixar have unfortunate been doing lately encanto red the little saw feels like it only exists due to skin colour and gender rather than starting with good story that just so happens to include mixed race character how could the same studio that made black panther make this ', ' this is so funny to me at the end but it is an good movie you have to see it and in the move there is good vs bad and the good won then it was to save the world and to not get talking over by the evil and they had to get all the good people to come back and then they had to train them again it was good you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it you have to see it ', ' had such great time with black widow yes the taskmaster reveal was disappointing but other than that the acting is great the visuals are great the fight scenes are great and the red guardian stands out in this movie ', ' am now halfway through the first season and there seems to be no improvement in sight there enough potential here to make an entertaining show but once again the sum of all parts makes an awful whole the acting is sub par although you have to give the cast some credit for trying to make something out of nothing there is virtually no background to draw some depth from so we are presented with stereotypical heroes and villains who can only act as sketchy characters but not as real human beings scientists are nerdy mr quarterback saves the day pretty face tries to be funny and likable sadly nothing out of the ordinary so far the main plot is vague at best well written series will puzzle the viewer with some twists and bits of information to chew on but most important we get someone to direct our antipathy to if the viewer has to ask him herself why should keep watching this series the clearly the writers failed here so far we get only henchmen who do stuff in order to achieve stuff meh no glimpse of greater scheme and not the slightest impression of serious force or threat nothing to be truly worried about just some vague conspiracy organization we know nothing about apart from the fact that it exists the problem is this evil organization doesn make the impression of plotting towards something bigger it just also doing stuff it nothing more than everyday business of h e d agents why worry about them neither the interaction between characters nor their decisions and roles can grow on this lack of depth the quests this group has been pursuing so far couldn make up for that as these also have been quite underwhelming regarding originality for me this show feels like listening to the radio it stays in the background with some pleasant well known tunes but never manages to touch me comfortable as it fills the silence with cotton candy but unable to draw real attention due to it lack of spiciness 6 10 ', ' first of all let me just establish the follow imdb film ratings as reference clockwork orange 8 5 aliens 1986 8 5 american beauty 8 5 full metal jacket 8 4 chinatown 8 4 fargo 8 2 donnie darko 8 1 scanner darkly 7 these are the kind of movies that get and should get 8 ratings they have real content they re innovative original intelligent and thought provoking they re timeless classics but the comparison may not be too fair being such different genres how does it really stand up to batman begins 8 3 watchmen 7 6 or any of the men series none of which reached and 8 these are all meant to fascinate and woe the same kind of target comic book fans adrenaline pumped teenagers and action yearning males yet they are aeons away in terms of originality depth story and execution from 2012 the avengers don really have much of gripe with the avengers itself as after seeing captain america expected nothing more than another formulaic blockbuster even so it pretty bad even for fill in the villain superhero threat formula movie ridiculous super villain flat characters no excitement as you know how things are going to turn out my disappointment is mostly with imdb d trusted their rating in the past but it seems as if that reliability is no longer either all the reviews are now being written by 10 year olds imdb users are losing brain cells at an incredible pace or something pretty fishy how many reviews that are titled things like awesome blew my mind or coolest superhero movie ever that you expect to be full of teenage adulation grammatical mistakes and tons of slang are actually very articulately written displaying profound knowledge of script direction acting and character analysis thought our education system was going down the drain where are all these lucid eloquent youths hiding out and being so instructed and discerning as they are why the hell are they giving such poorly made mediocre movie such high scores it looks like the industry eye has finally set on imdb viewer decanting power and is corrupting it authenticity beyond recognition from now on guess ll have to look elsewhere for real trustworthy reviews ', ' do not read comics ve tried but they just seem like watered down versions of the shows watched as kid like batman tas or teen titans but love cinema ve been keeping up with all the marvel movies released prior to the avengers and they were always teasing at an avengers movie and let me be the one millionth to say oh my god this is the greatest movie ve ever seen in my life and what movie it is it has comedy it has action character interactions drama everything movie needs not just comic book film any film but when you get down to it avengers is comic book that has been cleanly and perfectly translated to the big screen but what sets avengers apart from other movies is the mere fact that it worked every single character in this has been the leading man in their own movie or has the potential to be and yet the film focuses on them all it like if you got john lennon william shatner and george peppard to be in movie together with vincent price as the villain and the story managed to revolve around all of them the plot is unoriginal but that not what carries the movie what carries the movie is the characters even the scenes with thor cap iron man and nick fury just talking are fun and engaging and no scene drags or is too fast and that all this movie aims to be an overload of fun why are you still reading this go rent the movie and watch it you fool ', ' for me this movie is as generic as it can be it something watched lot same cliche very weak jokes weak action or action that ve seen million times what sane person would like car chases in 2021 this is so 2010x bit drama nobody cares about to sum up my rating is meh 5 10 and wouldn recommend this to moviegoers maybe for children that didn see many movies ', ' if you are fan of the marvel cinematic universe you probably felt the emotional rollercoaster that these movies cause we can see fantastic piece of work being done and the next movie is simply mediocre do take my hat off since lately marvel seems to have found its pace and has been on high note both in movies and tv but black widow undoes all that work for starters don know if it only me but am scarlett johansson fan overall as an actor so usually don point out flaws in that department but in this movie she didn quite seem to be in character it hard to figure out if it was potentially made on purpose to showcase different side of natasha but for me it simply feels odd one thing is to show humanity other completely different is changing the character personality it didn feel like the black widow we see portrayed in the other movies as an example in endgame we do see changed natasha but there it feels organic like good development then we start to see where the bigger problems are the action scenes feel completely off and the editing is very poorly made filled with fast changing sequences where we can see half of what happening and then there also the very bad cgi which is something that you for sure do not expect from big budget marvel movie although the story does have potential and it kind of makes sense giving the period where it takes place didn buy the whole family dynamic it feels very forced and there is absolutely no chemistry there didn care for any of the characters aside from natasha and her sister and also don care how good david harbour as performer as the comedy relief in this movie it just blend and unfunny nothing against the actor or his portrayal just don think the character is good feels completely irrelevant the movie as whole as some interesting aspects to it and it not an overall terrible film florence pugh is without doubt the best thing that comes out of this very solid believable performance good character and have this strong suspicion that it not by accident as we most likely will see more of her very very soon ', ' after watching many tv series which are based on marvel universe and dc universe never thought of watching daredevil series not especially after watching the ben affleck daredevil still watched after going through the trailers and reviews and much to my surprise m not at all disappointed the series is really good the acting although sometimes seen little premature but overall like each and every single episode to compare it with the recently hit series flash and recently concluded arrow season 3 must say m more eager to watch the daredevil series than those the flash started good but lost its way in the middle where it felt sometimes that the story is not moving anywhere concerning to the main storyline and they had to bring the arrow in between sometimes only to increase the attention and viewers but this series is really fast paced may be due to only 12ep season but it will really keep you engrossed hope it will not lose its way like arrow in the coming seasons so my verdict an excellent series to look out for great action sequences and plots particularly liked how they introduced and kept evolving the characters the hero and the villain mixed with their pasts and present one good thing which also working for the arrow series and if you see in the flash that was lacking the character build up especially linking it with the past so go for it m sure you won be disappointed ', ' marvel avengers assemble was an absolutely fantastic film it was great how they pulled all the different movies and their secrets and put them into the one film each actor played their part to their best and was gripping my seat at every turn there was lot of emotions in the movie including humour sadness and suspense one minute you would be crying and the next laughing this is great movie for the whole family but would advise that you watch the other superhero movies first as it would be hard to follow otherwise 11 out of 10 from me can wait for avengers 2 ', ' great show lot of action plenty good action hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhh ', ' for me surely ant man giant man wasp black panther and war machine will be in the avengers 2 as marvel studios has announced that this will be movie for ant man in 2015 and for sure wasp his wife will be in also announced that will be black panther movie in 2014 and war machine certainly will be in the avengers 2 after iron man 3 specially that he ought to be in the avengers as he appeared at some avengers posters about wolverine think it is impossible to appear in the avengers 2 specially after marvel sold him to another company as for spider man and doctor strange think it difficult but not impossible to be in the avengers 2 marvel sold them to disney and it is possible to make agreement between marvel and disney but think that doctor strange is more possible to be in the avengers than spider man ', ' to say this is on par with avengers endgame is sick joke love marvel but didn even finish this show it isn even true to the comics it pushed an agenda instead of creating story terrible acting and putrid story complete garbage the fact it has such good score from critics tells you what it all about they have ruined media and ruined marvel no one wants this no one is watching it for more than two seconds before they get tired of it like ms marvel in the comics she is great but in this show her powers are all wrong and most of all her personality is way off from the comics don waste your time certainly didn it the worst new show they ve made honestly none of the new shoes are that great the loki show is alright that about it ', ' btw that a compliment the show is fun original charming and bloody good time it will also anger lot of white 30 40 something boys because they will not identify and realize it not about them at all and therefore will immediately get mad and decide its oh so bad and just came up with excuses why they hate it do not fall for this if you are not one of these men and if you are hey saved you an hour no need to watch ', ' it a really cute show and enjoying every episode love it dunno why people are being so harsh it a really good show they should give it chance know everyone expects darkness and maturity but she a teen so of course this is teen show what do you expect we re seeing the story from her point of view and she 16 ', ' well understand girl desire to be famous and called an actress but really really here we have team of highly skilled professionals some with years of experience in many areas and we have skye show off know it all pretty face without any substance good for nothing character who they want us to believe is super hacker that kind of ridicuouls but in any situation she knows better than everyone else she never shuts up and always always behaves like she could do anything better than anyone else that she is the only one who understands what going on and knows what to do this show is not much but it could be better without this nauseating judgemental and shallow character ', ' spent most of this film bored silly the action is sub par the cgi is poor but the biggest disappointment is the title character felt some of the other marvel films did her more justice also casting ray winston as russian baddie was terrible choice so many better options that they could have gone for the few good things in the film were florence pugh and david harbour they at least added bit of humour to an otherwise boring film ', ' the idea was good and the overall sense for the series is okay but the whole blindness thing just don buy it ve seen how blind men act and it nothing like that even people who can see sometimes see blurry trip over and so on but not this guy he can sense the position of the beer in the fridge even if it is closed lot of unnecessary small talk too much lame attempts for joking enjoy watching it since it is in my favorite genre but it is totally exaggerated ', ' get the childish approach and all liked the ms marvel treatment in the videogame but this is just awful the show is by far the worst marvel thing ever watched ', ' full disclosure that have not seen all of the series so far just the episodes currently available however the actress and her family are so heartwarming and fun to watch the actress who plays kamala really nails her role and her best friend brad is the supportive best friend anyone would want the show is bit of sci fi fantasy of superheroes but also hint of teenage awkwardness and rebellion kamala is incredibly charming ', ' terrible acting terrible plot and real waste of time ', ' it is okay but don spend the money right away would highly recommend you wait for the tv free movie ', ' didn go into this movie expecting to really like it ll be honest but do personally enjoy ms marvel and monica also enjoyed captain marvel in this movie sometimes her character has annoyed me due to coming across as bit arrogant but think this movie humbles her lot more by reintroducing monica to her life wanted to praise zawe ashton for her role as dar benn thought she played really good villain m almost little sad we won get to see that character again and refuse to believe that her asking prince yan to kneal was not loki reference it overall just fun movie it is silly at times and can understand why some people might not like silly themes as we have been getting that lot of that with marvel especially with movies like love and thunder but we do get nice introduction to some old favourites at the end expected people to not really enjoy this movie before even went to watch it people don like brie larson people find ms marvel character annoying it didn really have fair chance from the go but in my opinion it is decent watch ', ' 10 10 just watched the marvels and all can say is that don understand the hate at all the movie had everything you expect from marvel movie it was fun the acting was very good it never felt too much or over the top iman vellani that plays kamala khan is great actress she really was born to play this part great casting and why all the hate on brie larson she is amazing in the marvel movies and the marvels was no different she did an amazing job you can see that she takes the role seriously and plays it from the heart teyonah parris that plays monica rambeau also did fantastic job with her part all the ladies did very well and we don even have to mention mr samuel jackson he is nick fury the surprises in the end of the movie also made me wanting more give me more ', ' usually when want to watch movie always look for the rating first rarely write reviews but after watching this series it is very normal and does not deserve high rating even filming the movie sometimes appears as if it was taken from phone camera the filming doesn have stabilizer like cheap budget series don want to talk much but after watching you will know what say ', ' um yeah this movie sucks probably the worst superhero movie ever made bazinga m just joking its sarcasm this movie is the total package the entertainment value of this film is just through the roof from the beginning you are instantly hooked when first watched the trailer knew this movie would be awesome it did not fail to deliver packs an epic punch when you watch this for the record have not seen the other hulk films because 1 he really isn a favorite character of mine and 2 the cg look of the hulk just didn appeal to me you watch the hulk in this film and your like whoa mark ruffalo as bruce banner hulk was just pure genius each superhero gets equal screen time no one is above anyone and actually preferred that this film is full of star power and m glad everyone got their share am visual effects artist and the effects for this film was just pure bred artistic masterpiece thought that transformers 3 was just awesome in terms of the the visual effects but the avengers is just superb the plot and character development is great everyone should see this movie even if you aren a comic book fan its pure entertainment value my rating is 12 10 and m going to see this film again and again ', ' the only real representation of muslim teens in the western media have watched all of marvels vreations was severly dissapointed with loki and the new spiderman they were hard to follow so much that it became boring understood however that it was needed for the multiverse thing this has me hooked series that is aimed for younger generation with many jokes lots of relatable muslim experience in the west loved it very sad that this is only 6ep not like the others 8ep wished to see more of it ', ' 99 of the time the imbd movie ratings are spot on at the time of writing this this movie is ranked 7 2 this is mind boggling worst marvel movie ever plot was dumb af movie felt like it was filmed by an indie director and crew took note of the director so can make sure to never watch her movies ever again do yourself favor and skip this one know it compelling to try and watch all the marvel movies but this one can be easily skipped adds no depth to the universe ', ' can only say this if you simply know the characters or have profound knowledge in comics or simply like the fantastic type this is the movie for you felt like teenage watching this excellent movie it has lot of fun action scenes an excellent plot and all the characters have their minutes to shine they are all as we know them from the comics and the movies must to all comics lovers going to see it for the second time today hope all enjoy it as did and believe me m on countdown for the second already ', ' full review on my blog max4movies adventures of captain marvel is an entertaining adventure movie with fun and thrilling main story arch evaluating this superhero adventure partly depends on the expectations the viewer holds as series of short movies the plot is blast if dated in execution as single movie it has repetitive structure and several tedious moments as well as bland almost interchangeable characters however as this serial sports more ingenuous superhero plot than most of today offerings it does have its charm ', ' the first and second episode are good but then the other episodes get super boring and predictable m not sure if even want to finish the season ', ' yeah it is an action packed flick from beginning to end the interweaving of all the marvel characters was done in coherent way and truly feel as though got my money worth out of it samuel jackson is an amazing actor and if you think about all the roles he executed so well it boggles the mind this is not to diminish the performances of all the other names who appear in this film robert downey by far has the best lines and his delivery is always spot on the cgi effects are great flawless and awesome plot screenplay and performances grade i was big fan of marvel as kid and the whole package stays true to the printed genre mark ruffalo was good pick for the latest hulk incarnation gweneth paltrow and scarlett johansson turn in fine performances and look hhhhotttt know that it just movie one must suspend reality and have buy in and don want to be hypercritical but 1 would expect that hulk thor would be uninjured in their battles and even ironman has his suit to protect him but the other three characters after all are really just human right though enhanced human in some way shape or form they just aren in the same class of super hero as the previously mentioned three in fact they aren super at all would think that each of them in succession would have been squashed by something thrown at them by one of the warriors from another planet 2 the suiting up process for ironman is starting to become little silly and didn like the shape change of the power plant in the middle of his chest from circle to triangle 3 the hulk goes from mindless well hulk to character who then helps the team pick pick pick after you see it m sure you ll agree that this movie is definitely not an 8 8 as movies go but the ratings system at this venue has always been flawed if you don read too much into it it pretty solid entertainment especially if you re an action fan marvel fan or fan of any of the actors involved and worth seeing on the big screen especially because the sound systems seem to have been upgraded in recent times but wouldn pay more than matin price s there is an additional snippet of movie inserted into the credit roll so don exit too quickly the only thing that really ticked me off was the 7 price tag for medium popcorn get real people rate it 7 ', ' dedicated marvel fan with some comics background came in with no idea what to expect and was instantly hooked with the characters the visuals and animations including the culture ', ' this has got to be the worst movie have ever seen completely mixed up and goes no where absolute rubbish ', ' m sure others will have liked this movie different strokes for different folks but have to say the fight scenes were convoluted there was no buy in and it didn seen like part of an overall story universe more like standalone movie maybe am the the wrong audience but female empowerment movie shouldn feel like it was made to be about female empowerment don watch iron man and think he great because he a man think it because it a good movie and there an exciting story my kids may like it but couldn even make it through the whe story ', ' agents of h e d will let you know that something is missing in the marvel world not even gregg and smulders are capable of break even with the show lack of maybe real heroes okay know it not about the big guys but the show could at least make use of some cgi heroes in the background just to show that eventually they do share the same space but the show is more disappointing than that first they are still trapped in that search for super humans they should ask dc comics and go to smallville and even h e d hq trade mark that marvelous flying fortress went missing it was replaced by matte black plane with exquisite engines probably running on gases expelled from the front ones was expecting to see an effective team work supported by technology but every agent seems busy playing with unusual gadgets until the miraculous technology reveals itself like silver plates ray to jump start their dead brains agents of h e d need to focus in numbers instead of lead roles please they are h e d not heroes not gi joe nor mutant p there will be time when writers will create characters that are not capable of hacking into super secret agencies from old vans and that will make everything more interesting ', ' just to be clear did not hate watch this movie my theater membership allows me to see one free movie per month and for november this was the movie saw the mediocre reviews and thought that there were probably worse ways to kill two hours suppose was right but this has to go pretty low on that list don know how this got released in the state it did the last marvel movie watched was thor 4 and that was also an incompetent mess although the marvels wasn as bad genuinely can think of any positives for this movie the only reason gave it 2 10 is because don think it ever becomes comically awful aside from one scene the two most widely praised elements of the movie were the action and the actress who played ms marvel the action was your standard cgi marvel goyslop and ms marvel was very annoying guess she was fine compared to how flat the other two leads were but not by much don go see this movie it is good thing that this movie is bombing as hard as it is maybe marvel will learn some kind of lesson from this but it more likely that they ll just keep paying to bring back legacy characters ', ' hi am from romania and love this show more than the avengers the show has everything sci fi action adventure madness betrayal emotion and more this makes the show so good in the beginning it was wery slow but in time it began to blow my mind in every possible way starting with season 4 this is the fifth time rewatch the series ', ' disclaimer am late to the mcu party so am slowly getting through them in timeline order so wasn overloaded with context for this one the film started off so well and was thinking oh man marvel is going to do much more lo fi gritty spy movie which can allow for far more intimate and human depiction of one of the more peripheral characters was definitely getting bourne flashbacks but was really keen to see where that went well it threw that out the window pretty quickly and resorted back to mcu tropes of ridiculous action scenes and mega explosions the final 30 mins especially were just so outrageous and over the top also found the accents really off putting the faux russian voices often gave comedic element to what was meant to be gritty or emotional dialogue and really undermined the performance of otherwise incredible actors feel like this was real missed opportunity to depart from mcu expectations and deliver darker more realistic film without the overload of superheroes alas ', ' am designer and great comic book fan since my childhood was drawing and reading comics when the movie opened in my country brazi was so excited to watch it it was like seeing kids on the garden playing all around and having fun because remembered the time when was drawing the hulk captain america iron man and many others had fun had everything good that you can get watching on the big screen its great movie and an epic to remember s people you gonna love it assemble ', ' first episode was way to cheesy and childish and thought it was going to be one of those teenage series but no it actually starts halfway episode two and from episode three it is really an exciting show to watch so do not rate until you watched at least till episode 3 the storyline and especially the plot changing at the end of each episode the different developments in the story and some historical and sometimes philosophical bottom lines makes if fun to watch am almost 52 and yes episode 1 is not made for my age but half episode 2 the show becomes interesting well done ', ' it exceeded my expectations great acting pleasant mix of emotions excellent cgi ', ' entertaining but the script is mediocre even for this movie genre the comedy relief characters are laughable stereotypes poorly executed some scenes between florence and scarlett are enjoyable they do have chemistry florence character usually takes the spotlight also cgi does not have the same quality of other movies in the mcu franchise ', ' gave it chance wanted to see them do something of quality if they were going to try for younger different audience even lowered my expectations but not low enough ugh ', ' this film is somehow way more depressing and worse than ant man quantumania we honestly thought eternals was bad but that was only the beginning it was only going to go downhill from there watching this movie felt like watching beloved friend in coma fighting for her life it was sad frustrating and ultimately hopeless so much potential squandered right before our very eyes much has been said about the girl power aspect of this story but it doesn mean jack when the characters are so thinly written after the big character tension build up between carol and monica with the latter resenting her for not coming back their fractures mend themselves very quickly there is no chemistry between the the two at all the villain is bland with capitol and highly forgettable nick fury is actually pathetic in this movie he doesn at all act like the fury we know and love he was more in character in far from home when talos was impersonating him don think ve ever had this much of bad experience with film since cats and it is telling that there actually features ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song memory what the actual hell marvel the only good thing is that it is mercifully short and iman vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role once great studio brought crumbling down on itself if could give it zero stars would ', ' nothing to appreciate mcu would have done better so much expectation from the mcu black widow deserved better ', ' the story is stupid the characters are stupid the story is meaningless and things happen suddenly without preamble this series from the first to the last episode is making no sense it not superhero tale it nonsense ', ' daredevil isn something unbeliveble agree but is not bad tv series after watching all 3 season these are my notes started good loved the fighting scenes given the fact that the main character was blind he acted strange even from beginning with the running and veering like person who can see that really made me like whaaat is he blind or they changed the script positive thoughts actors are good acting is good negative thoughts in real life if you stay near glass window and throw bead you wont even scratch the glass my score for this tv series is 6 10 ', ' looked like cross between nickelodeon show and one of those crazy bollywood films worst marvel production yet even worse than captain marvel none of the characters were the slightest bit likeable the main protagonists powers looked more like baddie on power rangers and can see how this is going to add anything to the marvel universe other than trying to appeal to couple of extra billion people guessing the next hero will be south american origin or antarican door is being left open for dc here in my opinion ', ' daredevil is no doubt about it the best comic show on air the stories are great the action the darkness it is amazing this is not show for kids and that what like it the most it dark intense and the fights are truly amazing hope netflix continues to produce several seasons for the future as simply love the show ', ' am doing rewatch and just couldn help but appreciate how good this show is compared to all current marvel studios shows the depth of every character is insane the storyline is amazing don get me wrong the show has had its bad days but overall it absolutely amazing love that they used to make so many episodes in every season now just 6 it extremely underrated mcu canon or not this show has created its own league every season is like brand new tv series and all the seasons competing with each other hope to see some of these characters appearing in future mcu projects ', ' there are elements that just needs to be in almost american show it just have to like the nerdy kids or youngsters they have to be somewhat clumsy and not really professional at all and its like that almost always wonder do the american people find this element funny as tv show creators always do this do they always find it funny can tell you that the rest of th world finds it boring annoying and irritating instead of making this so plastic as they have they could actually made it like h e d actually were professional organization instead of bunch of clowns shows that really stands out are shows like game of thrones sons of anarchy ended cause it ain plastic and cause it isn so american clich based make the carachters more professional no more stupid lines as this is filled with it you already have million shows like this this just happen to be about h e d make it stand out ', ' it just kind of bad making it significantly better than expected it to be starting with the good genuinely liked that this movie is intentionally silly the teleportation premise makes for some genuinely amusing visual gags and great deal of absurd concepts made their way in here and the weirdness is embraced with glee and liked the idea behind the villain and her motivations really many of the ideas present in this movie are compelling ones sadly none of them retain their intrigue in the execution the execution of this film plot themes and character arcs is all so easy everything is written to wrap up in the most obvious pandering convenient possible way leaving plenty of unfinished threads and stripping the story of any intelligence it may have had and that how this movie ends up feeling unfinished aside from smiling few times throughout felt nothing ', ' just finish season 1 will start loving the whole series it starts very slowly but after 8 episodes cant leave the screen season 3 is the best ', ' people are giving 2 star reviews or less didn reviewed any series before the reason why m writing is very simple this series could be childish but teaches us the reality the that why loved this series lot ', ' thought this was meant to be super sleuthing comic book action tv show but it turned out to be more like days of our lives with some bad action thrown in ', ' from teenager who grew up with superhero and loves them this movie really was good action scene were good they really showed what black widow and yelena were capable of ve always wanted black widow movie because she was the first female marvel superhero saw in movies and this movie didn disappoint me m not professional movie rater but coming from me teenager who grew up with superhero i really loved this movie ', ' liked it how ever it did come off as just nether avengers movie instead of stand alone movie ', ' yes you re reading the headline correctly we lasted 3 or 4 minutes into the film and upt and left what killed it so quickly for us cue the stupid cheap looking cartoon animation sequence which straight away raised the eyebrows cue lots of staring at each other and not the screen take note marvel and wondering if we were watching pre school tv show it didn help that we knew nothing about the character sat on the bed found out later she was introduced on disney and the cartoon sequence being unwatchable though apparently was quick rush about her origin and zzzzz didn get any further than that as we left the movie theatre thank god we were seated by the exit sorry but marvel really screwed up on this one which is one of the main reasons this film has bombed at the cinema new characters introductions and story arc should always be done through the movie first then flesh them out via streaming series not the other way round phase 4 is becoming convulted mess because of this and the movies and overall quality are suffering keep the movie stories streamlined and interconnected but please any series should be side arc which doesn interfere or is required viewing to understand the film how this got past pre screening in its present form is beyond me even more concerning is how it managed to get green lit for release by so many studio execs did they want it to fail another film may get round to watching in full at some point in the future what marvel disney should be more concerned about is my reluctance to part with more cash on future movies if this is how they intend to move forward 2 stars for the opening space sequence and feel that being very generous ', ' the movie starts off slow while the plot takes shape and everyone is brought up to speed on the threat the earth will soon face little too much time is spent with the peripheral characters black widow hawkman and fury but from the moment that one of the key protagonists first goes toe to toe with loki the film picks up pace what follows is entertaining but think keener fans of the marvel universe will feel the middle of the film comes just short of delivering expectations for example fight match up that was mean for the big screen including two of the most powerful of the entourage left me asking for more all is forgiven though as the action gets better and better throughout and by then end when you think you ve seen the finale it just keeps going the last 30 minutes of the film is the best of any superhero flick to date though do wonder if the budget for cgi could have been spread across the earlier parts of the film less thinly the humor throughout is hilarious though at moments it risks taking the material not seriously enough as though the cameras stopped rolling and everyone can stop pretending to be superheroes one of the heroes is the butt of the joke more often than fair and doesn get so many memorable lines or opportunities to show off like the others so if you happened to pick this one as favorite you might be little disappointed if not for the fact that the others in the entourage do kick so much ass ', ' this is very poor storyline and badly directed disappointment all around no wonder disney released early ', ' how can you not watch this been comic reader and always love seeing them in action when the director knew exactly what needed anyways best daym dd ', ' the show is awesome and have emotions which is good from marvel like 90s superheroes watched 2 episode till now and it awesome continue this show with same spirit ', ' the care into the first episode was really warming it was well written and the performances were charming m really looking forward to this as an origin it wild to me that people need to qualify this showing actually decent don need to have did to enjoy moon knight it a good show end of story ', ' this show has little more heart than many recent marvel shows it great to see diverse cast and new stories ingnore the bad reviews from ignorant maga hats who spend too much time watching fox news those deplorable people will always give you bad advice there no politics on this story it genuine and fun ignore all the maga haters who don like anything that moves the world out of the1950 ', ' this series is episodic so it is better to rate individual episodes the series is ongoing and will update my review as watch new episodes 9 10 these episodes don waste time by retelling the movie show story but rather focus on deep dives into casting character development screenwriting stunt work effects costume set design music cinematography etc loki season 2 7 10 these episodes don have any mind blowing new trivia and they still focus bit too much on simply retelling the movie show story but they check all the boxes for good behind the scenes documentary by exploring the casting screenwriting stunt work effects costume set design etc shang chi and the legend of the ten rings hawkeye black panther wakanda forever guardians of the galaxy vol 3 echo 5 10 these episodes have some good info and m glad watched them but at least 50 of the show follows the series terrible 2 10 formula wandavision what if eternals she hulk attorney at law ant man and the wasp quantumania secret invasion 2 10 these episodes contain no new information and are essentially in depth plot recaps of the movie show that you already watched as told by the leading cast crew the falcon and the winter soldier this one is particularly heartbreaking to watch as you can see all of the cast are genuinely excited for the show believing themselves to be part of something that will be amazing but completely oblivious to the fact that the director and screenwriters are destroying everything good about the series by trying to pull the plot in too many directions at once loki season 1 doctor strange in the multiverse of madness ms marvel 1 10 same 2 10 formula except they either completely ignore or fail to explain the decisions behind elements that were drastically changed for the worse compared to the comics black widow when talking about taskmaster they all but directly say diversity is literally the only thing required to make good movie show as if that somehow justified their decision to destroy every element of the character that fans enjoy and turn him her into one of many mindless martial arts masters in the mcu which was horrendous decision regardless of the character gender they also state black widow is unique because she is just really well trained and isn actually superhero while completely ignoring the fact that they bizarrely gave her superhuman strength and endurance for this film thor love and thunder actual quote don worry about all the previous thor movies you can pretty much forget everything about them werewolf by night 15 minutes of making of documentary buried alongside 40 minutes of the director family home videos ', ' my only complaint about this excellent action movie with strong female characters marvel can we pleeease have black widow movie now what her story we want to know she interesting is that it did not pass the bechdel test for those of you who don know this test it three simple questions 1 were there two or more female characters with names 2 did they speak to each other at any time 3 if yes on 2 did they speak to each other about something other than man the bad news is that this movie does not pass this test but good writing is good writing and it was so satisfying to see the story overflow with character development cooperation and friendships it was great seeing gorgeous black widow holding the team at the center as woman okay an ass kicking woman with no fuss or sexism just plain old everyday respect fighting her own battles and still be able to have personal moment full of heart and soul read my essay the perilous pumps of pepper potts about heroines feet and the two main women in this movie at http wanderingpie blogspot com 2012 05 avenge this html ', ' and so is taskmaster plot was meh action was good until the last bit the focus wasn even on natasha black widow it was more of the black widow in general kinda disappointed that this is the last scar jo movie as natasha she deserved better ', ' seriously expected alot from marvel movies huge letdown ', ' the show in my opinion has to much religious overtones and barely any marvel action in it ve never seen any marvel movie or show that was this heavily based on religion or based on religion at all boring to watch ', ' yes the film doesn really break any new ground but dang it is completely serviceable and rollicking marvel movie and fits in well with the rest of the mcu the only real complaint have personally is that it should have been made years ago so yes agree with some reviews that complain of the lateness of the project but scarjo really always and consistently knows how to sell scene and this film is no exception and yes also agree that relative newcomer florence pugh is near impossible to look away from she has genuine big screen gravitas and is likely to go on to have very rich and varied film career have read some incredibly vitreolic reviews and am floored by them just exactly what is it that has made them so angry it is beyond my understanding filled with gorgeous men and women running around and having adventures all over the place with little injections of humor and pathos here and there not overdone just right why would anyone complain had ball laughed hid behind my hands bounced on the edge of my seat and even shed tear or two complete success of movie even if it was waayy too many years late in coming also love movies that rarely refer to gender and don try to push anything down your throat and this was definitely one of those films gender schmender who cares if the story is filled with mostly men or mostly women or anything in between as long as the story gallops forward at decent pace and inspires you to care about the characters yep total win don listen to the nay sayers am genuinely not sure what movie they watched ', ' the marvels is neither good nor terrible it just fine know m on record as saying movies have gotten too long but this one might actually be too short the first act feels very disjointed and frenetic it needed to slow down and spend little more time introducing the characters and setting up the dramatic stakes and the final battle also feels surprisingly abbreviated was also bit lost because haven seen the ms marvel disney show that said the movie has couple of memorable scenes cat lovers will enjoy the movie and the three leads are great plus it always fun to see samuel jackson as nick fury but the most exciting thing to happen in the movie takes place in the mid credit scene and that how you know it not great movie ', ' after reading all the negative reviews went into this with low expectations and it failed to meet even those it was destroyed and poorly directed with lack of motivation from all their characters as for mcu movies we are introduced to 2 new characters who just don measure up to the rest of the avengers we have 114 year old pakistani girl who is just happy to be there for 90 minutes but surprisingly can outfight trained assassins then we have captain marvel best friend child whose powers are never really flushed out in the movie and then it goes off the rails for while and becomes musical this movie is just disaster saw it in big theater with 4 other people in the whole place expect it will lose lot of money do not recommend ', ' florence pugh is definitely great addition to the mcu and yelena personality really stole the show ', ' finally black widow gets what she deserves that took too long people this movie is amazing excellent plot cool action scenes immaculate humor and just in case that wasn enough they gifted us with the best sisterhood we could possible have ask for scarlett and florence need new movie together that it the only thing bad about this one is that we won see them work as sisters anymore the low rating fragile men who can deal with the fact that she is way more than pretty face and way cooler than captain america ', ' have watched this show both seasons at least 4 times now it awesome jon rage as the punisher makes the whole thing work season 1s plot line was the better of the two but both are fantastic the twist on the story in moving from an fbi agent to force recon marine makes the whole thing more interesting loved the comics and while enjoyed the various movies only the late the critics who were critical of the series often were upset with the violence and not enough ethical discussion of whether or not it was justified compare those critics to the people who loved the original star trek series and hated the star trek movie with chris pine in it because there wasn enough political debate over tribbles in the end the plot is about man consumed by the rage at the unjustified loss of his family man that struggles with his desire to vomit suicide by criminal government police and desire for vengeance on the people who destroyed him love the show can wait to see the next installment ', ' this is my favourite show after one year of it cancellation still can believe that it really gone but other shows came back after cancellation daredevil can come back too along with the punisher ', ' who watched the mrs marvel series already knew the tone the movie would have it achieves what it wants and it is fun and cute not cinema masterpiece and it never intended to be one things that annoys most people are the connections literally to know much stuff here you needed to be catch up with all the movies and series related on mcu also the space between mrs marvel are too long to remind of the character not normal marvel movie as could be done in series but think the intent was to show to more people the new characters and create interest could be series score 6 0 out of 10 0 ', ' ll keep this short really enjoyed this upon release at the cinema and did again 6 years later great marvel movie bringing the preceding mcu movies all together as one ', ' m not fan of superhero movies black widow works well without be masterpiece decent performances from the cast and superb performance from florence pugh the cinematography is simple the action scenes are not that cool and the special effects are bad an entertaining film but not amazing ', ' thought it was going to awful because that what everyone was saying finally got around to it and it wasn that bad it not classic or even one rewatch over and over that being said had some really good moments this one had charm humor and my favorite of the newer marvel movies think one of the reasons this wasn liked is because we like to see super heros are the infallible good guys mrs marvel made mistake and it humanized her character in way that appreciated kamal related to lot in this movie while am not her age if met ironman at her age would have acted similar gotta love good fan girl and ball scene ', ' it took me three attempts over three nights to get through this story dull and predictable acting oh dear not good especially the accents pugh especially cgi over the top and not that great the so called humour in this film just felt miss placed and clumsy almost an after thought still better than wonder woman 84 though just ', ' one of the television series that captivated me quite the episodes are very unexpected and it is noted that was very well written and thought very interesting episodes not the bane involved loved it ', ' the previous marvel tv series have all been dark or serious hawkeye being the most lighthearted of the bunch m only one episode in but it looks like this show is different there a vibrant teenage energy to this show it moves fast visually and dares the viewer to keep up if you had fun watching the mitchells versus the machines thor ragnarok bend it like beckham or scott pilgrim vs the world you are likely to have fun watching this as well the day 1 review bombers by culture weebiors are nuts ', ' after watching season 1 and 2 of daredevil didn think anything could beat the action packed vigilante show the first season of dd was definitely off to slow start but then slowly picked up pace and had nice finish for season 2 so decided to watch jessica jones since was dying for season 3 of dd watched the first episode and was actually pretty impressed im huge marvel fan didn know much about jj the only thing did know was that she had super strength and that she was the wife of luke cage after watching the 1st episode was attached to the show finished the whole season in week holy sh it was amazing there was so much action and was so attached to the charters the acting is amazing d recommend this show to anyone who loves marvel think there was just something about the way the show was written that made it so great this is definitely one of those late night fridays after hard week of work shows to watch ', ' marvel new daredevil series on netflix gets it right by at least this long time daredevil fan and for me the validation is in the special thanks section of the ending credits of each episode there the series gives nod to stellar cast of writers and artists who helped mold daredevil comics over the years and whose vision has well informed and inspired this spectacular series not only is this series dedicated to great television but to paying respect to the artistic integrity that many comic books fans hold so highly yes m longtime daredevil comic book fan so the names listed in the credits is more than familiar giving special thanks to brian michael bendis gene colan klaus jansen alex maleev david mazzucchelli roger mckenzie frank miller john romita jr john romita sr joe orlando archie godwin george tuska and although not mentioned in this list dd creator stan lee and comic writers joe quesada and jeph loeb are credited as well ve seen the first 6 episodes already and every time this frame of the credits plays my mind correlates the details from the episodes with the comic books that inspired them so many details let just take quick tour of course there is the original stan lee origin but specifically the show get it big art direction push from the frank miller john romita jr daredevil the man without fear mini series from the 1990 which inspires much of the netflix series visual details and style of narrative the costume matt wears with the black mask was the vision of this pre costume tale add to this the feeling of urban realism from the epic miller david mazzucchelli daredevil born again series and was hooked there the street grit which began in the 1970 gene colon days and was perfected in the frank miller klaus jansen in the 1980 the run of daredevil that revolutionized comic books and there are the politics corruption and styling of the bendis maleev comic book run of the 2000 to break up the grim of dark the series gives us some light moments with humor inspired by happy go lucky moments of foggy and karen remind me of both the carefree days of the stan lee but also the mini series daredevil yellow by jeph loeb who is also producer of the netflix series and the wilson fisk and vanessa plot finds inspiration in the best of both miller and bendis as for the superhero action the series does not disappoint the filming and choreography of the fight scenes of daredevil is stunning using mix of both tight details of fists and impacts along with long single take shots in which punch after punch is stylized with realism that is not often seen in superhero films daredevil barely makes it through each fight sometimes against dozen men who don stay down the fight scenes remind you of long boxing match where both fighters can barely stand fitting nod to daredevil boxer father and to the meticulously choreographed fight scenes from the comic books with visual queues from miller janson mazzucchelli standing out in my mind marvel netflix daredevil has hit on their their hands can wait to binge watch the rest of the episodes and m already expected there will be season 2 the direction and writing is cut above the usual from average superhero films and is not only going to win comic book fans but the growing audience of people who love the film superhero genre if you haven watched it you should now once you do comic book fan or not you will understand what fans of daredevil experienced in this heroes long history ', ' his brief guest role on daredevil had given me hope even though thought bernthal wasn phisically imposing enough to be an accurate punisher thought the tone was right unfortunately it didn carry over to this stand alone series the plot is interesting enough albeit bit convoluted but the main character simply doesn match the one in any of the comic books that ve read he too jumpy too emotional to be the real frank castle only when he plans and executes confrontation with large number of foes does the classical punisher come through but the series would have needed more of the rest the punisher is loner for sure but he also calculating killing machine he not slightly psychotic weirdo who ready to snap at any moment also too many lifeless side stories ', ' joss weadon perfectly balances comedy and action with an ensamble of greats tom hiddleston glamorous and styleous loki is brilliant and joy to watch it sad that this movie didn get nominated for best picture because it really really did deserve it ', ' captain marvel more like captain meh vel what is so good about this movie everything is lackluster and there seems to be hardly any effort put into any part of it from the writing and acting to the production and editing want my money back ', ' was gutted when daredevil was cancelled easily the best super hero show on tv let not give up on red yet savedaredevil ', ' it amazing what eye candy can do these days if could sum up this movie it would be it the embodiment of all that shouldn be in film you could create mountain directed to the gods just out of the pile of this movie throws down at you mind you this movie has some good points the ending was magnificent especially when the curtains closed on this stunning film and everyone started clapping in awe of the awesomeness that is packed into this phenomenal creation it not joss whedon fault if anything it marvels egotistic attempts to blow apart their wallets with the amount of money they manage to make from this one film it really teaches you what some flashes and few of your favourites can do to create fanboy paradise full of jaw dropping boredom that will leave you wondering why you ever torrented this or spent those 20 dollars on an utter pile of ', ' had absolutely no hope of this one making it big the second took my seat boy was proved wrong by many mile there a reason this is only the second super hero movie in the top 250 coz its worth it period was absolutely glued right from the first minute it was an awesome mixture of high end action drama suspense thrill humor and love ok maybe not love who would want that in super hero movie anyway iron man was at his brutal best whether it was tactics word play narcissism or just plain old explosive action he just did not disappoint if you thought iron man only did solo you are in for surprise thought hawkeye and the black widow were going to be just another pair of dummies not they are as much part of the story as the rest of them be prepared for some of their cool moves man does scarlett look stunning when she is beating the hell out of the bad guys hawkeye might have done way better with gun but what the hell to each his own thor and cap america the demigod and the strategist with the awessssome weapon and shield combo totally kicked butt ask loki horde perhaps there was little the captain could do with just his shield and the best for the last for those who had lost all hopes of hulk ever entertaining them this one changes it all he is now my favorite today what raw madness ask loki this time hulk gives it all with pinch of humor that we have missed in the previous two movies the first half was built around bringing all the super heroes together and setting up the story line without deviating from the end plot the second half just blows you away joss whedon seems to have become master artist when it comes to super cool dudes he given each of the good guys an equal say in the movie with none in particular ruling the show in the end the 2 and half hours of non stop fun seemed to be way less and was left craving for more this summer is gonna be really hot folks and the avengers just got the party started hoo haa go watch it ', ' it just sad lazy writing very poor lead cant like it its terrible sorry the plot is not enjoyable and slow the idea is very badly executed really haven watched worse thing it is too bad to even describe not worth watch ', ' the overall links of the trio is interestingly set there some interesting way of gathering them lot of the actors are either badly directed or simply bad actors good movie is supposed to be good vilain and there not her acting skills equal her lack of charisma some parts are well directed and then form 10 minutes you swim in pool of nonsense that bring nothing to the story the flaws of captain marvel are interestingly set and the link with her and mrs marvel well balance rambeau seems to be out off the story and never properly integrated in the trio or even in the story movie not as bad as the other cents marvel but way bellow the one prior the death of iron man ', ' yet again disney and the mcu make trash show why do they even bother making these boring superhero shows anyways its the same old story and different people its tiresome and repetitive ', ' in my opinion the film started hard and fast which really drew you in understand people saying it slowed up but it tied up lot of loose ends for the bigger picture mcu the climax and ending proved satisfactory everything you could want in marvel film ', ' watched it and have to say defo worth the worth yes it aimed at younger watchers but then again anyone can watch it loved it and not everyone is gonna enjoy it but then again everyone is different ', ' certainly not as great as civil war most definitely not as bad as lot of reviewers are saying good acting plausible plot disappointingly cut action scenes typical marvel snarky dialogues overused cg one of the reasons why many reviewers didn like read hated the movie is probably because it a little too late we already know what happens to our beloved nat maybe some people just can get over endgame and phase 1 3 to like something new easily deserves 6 10 rating 10 just to balance out an unnecessarily negative review ', ' this series is huge drag for me myself and partner watch all the series we have our differences she enjoyed wander vision didn i liked moon knight she didn but we both agree that this is just terrible the story is boring the characters are corny and forced although it great that it showing more culture it almost becomes too much about it some of the actors are clearly putting on pakistani accents when they probably born in sussex the whole thing just feels cheap lifeless and feeble attempt at pushing more culture into mcu don understand how some places give it 98 when everyone ve asked dislike the series good try but this ain it chief ', ' personally thought the film was enjoyable at best yes the story was little slow but the comedic relief moments were excellent and getting insight into natasha past made it all the better at this point we shouldn be expecting complete comic book accuracy it might be because didn expect much post endgame but thought the film was good no better no worse but good and not waste of watch ', ' everything is wonderful but the sounds of punches exaggerated ', ' item 47 is the worst one shot it somewhat random random people find this gun and rob banks with it everything seems weird and out of place it nice to watch but definitely not good ', ' this was real struggle to get through even at its relatively short run time for recent marvel films the tone is all over the place m not sure what the director was going for but it quite disorienting it feels like this film was somewhat butchered in the edit suite and perhaps there were re shoots as it doesn hang together coherently at all brie larson is incapable of having chemistry with others which we already know the girl playing ms marvel was by far the most endearing the rambo character is just whole load of nothing and her acting for the post credit scene was embarrassing heard sniggers when they were clearly going for an emotional moment d save your money if were you wish had ', ' the avengers is not an average action flick in fact it is an excellent one the success of this film relies not only on the spectacular visual effects and sustained action sequences but mostly on the characters and the interactions between them iron man captain america thor black widow the hulk and hawkeye are treat to watch as they kick ass exchange clever one liners and desperately work together to fight off loki and his minions each actor portrays their character with zeal and believability we don just see robert downey jr sarcastic nature or the ripped biceps of chris evans we see tony stark iron man and captain america saving the world from certain demise as result we find ourselves cheering them on this is what makes great super hero flick rdj does get most of the lines but he does not steal the show entirely from the other characters for they have chance to develop too for nearly 2 hour and 30 minute film the avengers flies by the action scenes are not just big explosions and blatant cgi one sequence in particular is reminiscent to the destruction of chicago in transformers dark of the moon but there are several one on one fights with the super heroes and the villain not trying to give any spoilers but the fight between thor and the hulk is true visual effects feast and well choreographed sequence some of the action scenes are very long but unlike the last few michael bay films found myself begging for more the plot is nothing special or too memorable however it is easy to follow anyone who has not seen some of the other action films ex thor captain america iron man will not be confused for the scriptwriters made the avengers film of its own and not crossover of the other features it is worth noting that the writers also pack lot of witty and sometimes unpredictable humor into the mix to sum up the avengers is the best super hero flick have seen years it has everything ask for in the genre ', ' first off as others have stated florence pugh is the highlight of this her performance was fantastic and in my opinion she saved the movie this was originally supposed to be an origins film but instead it takes place after civil war this was probably my biggest disappointment considering marvel has been teasing the backstory for so long and we didn get it in the black widow stand alone film the cgi in many of the fight scenes is borderline laughable and it makes you wonder what they spent the budget on it not unwatchable but can believe that this is what marvel disney thought was worth delaying for so long those giving this high ratings must be studio plants because as long time fan was dissapointed ', ' don get this at all she the worst superhero bad writing is all can say in season 1 she more mind controlling than what his face she gets more people killed because she a alcoholic don know anyone who can survive drinking that much everyday like every second scene is alcohol ', ' saw the marvels at my local regal theater on scale of one to five stars give the marvels 1000 stars was constantly cheering and excitedly stomping my legs during this movie my heart grew 1000 sizes while watching this love these characters and loved them together ms marvel is absolutely the heart of the film but monica rambeau and carol danvers were also great spent the whole movie wishing we had lots more of both of these characters in the mcu the kahn family were also great funny for sure but also supportive and helpful and goose the cat was also delight and all of the future teases this was all of the fun and more probably have to see this again tomorrow after work ', ' so nice to see the younger hero making an appearance hope this is positive start continues for alot more appearances of ms marvel her family is great also nice to see other cultures getting representation in the museum ', ' after ton of extremely negative reviews went in there with no expectations and came out pleasantly surprised just goes to prove that some people will just hate to hate my main letdowns were the villain although her motives understandable was underwhelming and forgetable and loved zawe ashton in fresh meat and wanderlust so its not on the actrice also found monica to not really add to much value cgi was not great at some points on the other hand enjoyed the pacing duration of the movie and the power switching concept also liked the humour in the form of kamalah her family and the flerkens without it being to much cough cough thor t carol got some much needed softness all in all it was an entertaining yet unimaginative superhero movie with some cool fightsequences fun main characters and yes some flaws everyone who scored below 4 or above an 8 just doesnt know nuance or objectivity ', ' m obviously one of only few but really enjoyed this movie because it different from the other marvel movies loved the storyline and the female friendships and teamwork loved the singing and cats and cats thought the fight scene at the beginning of the movie was one of the most fun fight scenes ve seen in while think the package deal of kamala kahn and her family is great funny addition to the mcu amen to the south asian representation ll admit my movie opinions always seem to be different than others for instance much preferred wonder woman 1984 which others seemed to dislike compared to the first ww do tend to prefer the wacky over the ordinary and this movie was little wacky anyway yes this movie is little chaotic and crazy but that what made it engaging for me to answer another reviewer question about who this movie appeals to nope not just teen girls grown adults liked this movie as well ', ' this dated way better than thought can believe how much this is better than the later avengers films back then it wasn made only for memes product placement popular culture and cheap cliffhangers the cgi is somehow better than the later films so is the story and everything else m surprised that they dropped the quality so much nowadays yet these films are getting more and more popular somehow this film has some very cool action scenes admit sometimes it has obvious green screen scenes but for the most part the cgi is very good the sounds and camera work are pretty great too this film was kind of groundbreaking in its time because it features multiple superheroes at once which wasn really done at the time or at least with as many superheroes and such quality very good comparison to the later films is the entrance of each superhero in this film there are only six main superheroes yet everyone entrance is memorable and each of them has enough time in the film and takes huge part of the story and now look at infinity war or endgame which has over 20 superheroes and most of them don have any impact on the story and barely have any time in those films at all the assemble has been really watered down guess this film drags after the first action scenes about 10 15 minutes could easily be cut from there but over than that the pacing is good it also did not do the overstretched ending which endgame has the story itself is pretty good it could ve done lot worse considering that similar films of the time did not try as hard thor captain america overall this is still one of the best mcu films ', ' my brother told me to watch this so did and omfg this was awesome it starts off slow and then it starts to get better and better each episode literally couldn stop watching this the story line is awesome and there is tons of action so you never feel like you are getting bored of it and every episode there is most likely going to be lots of action and tons of blood now saying all this good stuff if you don like blood and and stuff then this is not for you bc there is tons of it but this is must watch ', ' the short and sweet it good go see it action out the yin yang humor family drama and it even has room for rug pull or two marvel is back baby the boring and pretentious review it been while huh the rona put the brakes on marvel phase 4 designs and it taken more than year to get back on track damn you ronaaaaaaaaa was it worth the wait well that depends on your own perso oh the hell with it hell yeah it was worth the wait black widow comes roaring into theaters this month to remind us what makes marvel movies so damn fun and boy has it been about damn time ostensibly an origin story this functions more as an expansion of natasha romanov aka the black widow character history but the operating word here is action action and dare say it even more action not quite sequel not quite prequel midquel the film is set immediately after the events of captain america civil war but follows more closely the winter soldier both in style and tone and could well serve as that film spiritual successor like in winter soldier director cate shortland and writers have opted for cold war era style spy thriller don worry if you haven the director name before hadn either after this she will become household name joining the likes of patty jenkins from wonder woman giving the boys run for their money in directing comic book movies and she ain the only one the ladies are running the show here with florence pugh and rachel weisz joining johansson and stellar cast that includes david barbour hopper from stranger things and ray winston just in case you thought this was merely filler film until the heavyweights arrive later in the year this widow is punching well above her weight class johansson always dominated her mcu scenes with cap and the avengers and here she is given chance to flesh out her character but the entire cast displays strong showing with pugh weisz and barbour in particular clearly enjoying themselves they do such great job it would be shame if marvel and the mouse don keep using these characters in the future the film opens with wholesome scene of americana before cleverly setting up its spy thriller conceit that extends right into the opening credits the action hijinks start early and they are frantic and non stop with fight scenes that look choreographed by somebody that studied their jason borne well fights that feel desperate and immediate and make use of whatever household items happen to be around in order to subdue or kill an opponent violent gun fights car chases martial arts it all here but besides all of that marvel genius continues to be in the menacing villains it continues to come up with to antagonize the heroes in the taskmaster they have another memorable one fighting power house that can imitate anybody fighting style just by looking at them the scenes featuring him are some of the best in the whole movie to be fair the film is not without its flaws the plot gets little convoluted at times and some of the action seem over the top compared to the tight groundedness of the winter soldier and depending on your taste its denouement will come across as trite but these are minor quibbles for film that was such fun getting you there self aware action packed marvel flick with maybe more than hint of metoo commentary this injects rejuvenating shot into character that was by all means supposed to have been over and done with can wait to see what else marvel has in store and of course don forget about that after credits scene ', ' doesn do anything for the mcu the action scenes were well choreographed but besides that the rest of the movie is bland the dialogues are mostly cringy the acting wasn the greatest if you are mcu hardcore fan watch it but know that you are not missing out if you skip this one ', ' the youngest of marvel heroes iron man first appearance in comic format 1968 leads the way into science fiction spectacle of superlatives robert downey jr portrays tony stark aka iron man with ease and occasional sophistication in times of crisis this is exactly what happens when the h e d facility led by nick fury since 2010 given face by actor samuel jackson is under attack by mediocre villain loki who remains just puppet for supervillian thanos to be one of the major action confrontation in avengers part three 2018 and four 2019 of the marvel movie series soundtrack by hollywood veteran composer alan silvestri and digital cinematography by seamus mcgarvey only excellerate this hollywood blockbuster ride of summer 2012 directed by passionate director joss wheddon who had been trusted enough by marvel studios and operating executives at paramount studios to fulfil cinematic vision of pace whoa and joyful acting beats avoiding any moment of this picture to be dull standing strong contribution for the ultra high budgeted decade of professional filmmaking in the 2010s in hollywood ', ' that it for younger audience ok and disney let alone marvel have made every single spiderman show let alone movie towards younger audience and succeed especially the cartoons guardians of the galaxy avengers iron man men the gosh darn super hero squad show all of the shows just named are made for kids and teenagers and they are amazing wanna know why ms marvel is not good the same reason why she ruined the avengers game 1 nobody asked for her don mean the actor mean the character itself 2 it too self centered the personality of ms marvel is too bubbly it comes off as annoying and borderline childish 3 there has never been more hated character in marvel roster than ms marvel if they were to do show on dog welder it would have made disney whole lot more money than this ever would ', ' short and sweet good backstory yes relatable hero with real struggles yes tons of action and intense fight scenes yes secondary characters developed and integral to plot yes amazing bad guy definitely punisher is good the others had first seasons that were ok daredevil has delivered all 3 seasons so far eager for season 4 ', ' was absolutely floored by how different each season of daredevil is from each other in terms of overall quality and entertainment value the first season was solid effort and d suggest that any mcu fan at least give it shot if for no other reason than so you can appreciate how phenomenal vincent onofrio is playing wilson fisk the kingpin then season two was even better as the mcu gratifyingly showed us the origins of the punisher jon bernthal was truly perfect casting as frank castle and so it almost goes without saying that he absolutely deserved his own punisher spinoff if you are only going to watch single season of daredevil then this is definitely the season to pick but season three was so unbelievably horrible that could barely get through it don get me wrong the acting was fine and most of the production values such as the cinematography and music were still solid but the writing became absolutely atrocious basically every single major character in the show spends the entire third season just making one incredibly stupid decision after another mean you will find yourself literally screaming obscenities at your television just based on how frustratingly dumb every character and every situation becomes it goes from one jump the shark moment to another until eventually it gets to the point where you honestly don care about any of the characters any longer and you just want the entire series to end already that is not exactly the hallmark of well written or entertaining television am not sure if the entire writers room changed between seasons 2 and 3 or not but do know there was showrunner change at that point as steven deknight turned the reigns over to erik oleson and at least based on the writing credits listed for each episode it sure looks to me like oleson brought in his own set of writers so am pretty sure that we do know who to point the finger at when it comes to the blame for destroying what was previously pretty good show in any event just know that season three was truly awful from start to finish and so d highly recommend skipping the entire darn thing just go into daredevil thinking of it as encompassing 26 episodes over two seasons and then skip straight into watching punisher instead you ll thank me later ', ' don know about this one thought it was ok the action was fun and the story was fun but overall the film is missing something but dont know what it is the plot is about young girls who want to become superheros that are big time and they get the opportunity the cool part and quite honestly my favorite part of the film is samuel jackson as nick fury love the character of nick fury and he does not disappoint one bit in this film otherwise that is about it for me it just ok could take the film or leave it nothing to great here to see in my opinion but watch if you love marvel ', ' very short counter review from long time movie freak not so much superhero freak although read lot of comic books the avengers is completely overestimated in my mind why it mostly reminded me transformers 2 and transformers 3 which were both god awful movies very similar pointless action and destruction without any weight if compared to nolan batman films this is very cheap storytelling without gravity also almost slept watching the avengers there is no threat what so ever the villains are plastic robots very boring no tangible psychology behind it there no story the flying ship is hugely boring most of the so called heroes are sissies in thighs thor loki arrow dude captain boring etc with exception of the iron fellow who wears steel anything good not really give one star from male perspective scarpetta johansson as it nice to call her is surprisingly watchable when trapped in her chair cheap trick but works also other male star hulk is interesting those few seconds he got reasonable sequences all in all two stars there only few seconds of interesting stuff to watch during this overlong 2 5h film try but fail to understand all the hype hopefully you can accept my reasoning ', ' oh my this was painful to watch terrible story uninspired characters and didn even make much sense hopefully this puts nail in the captain marvel storyline coffin captain marvel herself looked like she wished she was anywhere else in the universe except in this movie yikes and don get me wrong m actually one of the 17 people who really enjoyed the original captain marvel loved the storyline and writing and characters brie larson looks tired and haggard nick had so many cliche lines that it ceased to be funny when he was really trying hard the 3 of them had no chemistry but kamala khan had the best acting and had just the right cuteness to pull off her mostly poorly written lines monica character was so forgettable that it is embarrassing please do yourself favor and order pizza delivery and sit in your favorite comfy chair or couch and just go on youtube instead and watch cat videos your brain will thank you ', ' this is one of the most enjoyable superhero shows out there it sad that it coming to an end in 2020 ', ' the other show to survive marvel brief enthusiasm and then almost immediate disregard for animated series after o o was hit monkey from archer creators floyd county the show is nicely animated and not lacking in violence and humour if m honest though finished it more out of compulsion rather than enthusiasm when his troop is killed the surviving monkey fred tatasciore swears revenge and using the guns of dead professional killer bryce fowler jason sudeikis begins an assault on the criminal underworld of tokyo trying to find those responsible he joined by the ghost of fowler who is bound to the monkey and who tries to mentor him even though he can be seen or interact with anyone else though as type this it not confirmed either way m going to assume that there won be any more hit monkey in the future it not perhaps as much due to any failure of the show itself just that it was one of the last shows to be commissioned before marvel tv division came under the movie team control and feige team prefer to focus on their own ideas for the future found the show to be good rather than great the animation is good it not quite in the style of archer the line work is less bold and the movement is smoother in fact the dynamism of the show is one of it strengths its other strength is probably jason sudeikis who provides laconic drawl to fowler but keeps him the right side of likable it the story that perhaps struggles bit rather than slaughtering repeated villains the pair become embroiled in political struggle for power one that includes twist that you ll likely see coming well before the plot wants you to there are some strong villains though reiko aylesworth plays lady bullseye and the silver samurai appears towards the end of the run it just two or three episodes longer than it needs to be again didn hate it but certainly ended up watching it out of sense of obligation at finishing what started rather than any true joy at the series ', ' this is definitely one of the best sci fi shows of all time it does such of great job of building and expanding the world of the mcu if only the movies had take it more seriously ', ' all could think of while watching the first episode was this is cringe this is cringe this is cringe over and over m marvel fan watch everything and give it fair chance this ain it don know if it the actor or the character but something makes kamala impossible to watch thanks marvel hate it ', ' enjoyed the show and like many transition from daredevil to this show while the show is good the characters seem 2d hard to relate to and the storyline seems copy and pasted together if you pay careful attention to the plot you ll notice little holes characters suddenly knowing things they haven found out yet heros and villains making blatantly dumb decisions etc however having said all that it was worth the watch though those little things would bug me ', ' captain marvel is phenomenal though in the movie it has shown that no one has power that can tackle her and she beats each and every ass but it a very good introduction of her so as in avengers end game we can see and accept how she will be leading the avengers ', ' season 1 was amazing gave us look at gritty hero with no powers just relatable story with all the action you could ask for season 2 was some weak on how they wrapped it really fast and to the point hopefully we get season 3 on the new disney app ', ' the 21st century has seen more superhero movies than can count this year alone has already seen black panther won deny that stan lee created diverse variety of do gooders in the marvel universe the avengers not to be confused with the 1960s tv series is entertaining enough it nothing special much of it is sensory overload but it nothing that it doesn pretend to be loki is the common suave but malevolent villain he could trick anyone into thinking that he a decent person this movie will definitely please the leonard hofstadters sheldon coopers howard wolowitzes and raj koothrapalis of the world it was pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the world security council got played by jenny agutter the nurse in an american werewolf in london d like to see crossover between this movie and john landis horror movie anyway it not the ultimate masterpiece but undeniably fun ', ' the avengers k avengers assemble 2012 umr 10 10 director joss whedon stars robert downey jr chris evans scarlett johansson mark ruffalo chris

watch in any cinema near you more reviews https www facebook com unitedcbamr copyright 2012 unitedcba all rights reserved ', ' this short series gives marvel characters brief recap of their history throughout the mcu think that the episodes do well job of conveying the story of each character but it definitely feels like it drags on at certain parts and the episodes could have been edited more smoothly and could have used better music and sound effects at the dragging moments of the episodes is where they need to have better music and sound effects to keep the audience more engaged the episodes do their job but are okay at best considering how mediocre the editing is ', ' have seen iron man 1 like the movie but iron man 2 3 are mere waste of time when heard abt movie which contains many super heroes expected something good and iwas by seeing it is rated 8 9 in the first day had expected good story good acting good actions and vfxs but could only find the last thing in the movie downloaded hd print of 2 5 gb within 8 days but after watching the movie realized that wasted my whole time don like captain america in his own movie too he is not powerful and the actor is completely disappointing in the role 5 6 superheroes to fight against halfly retarded villain only hulk did provide some entertainment spent large portion of the film wondering where hawkeye kept getting arrows from understand that this was summer blockbuster that alone makes me cut it little slack but honestly just don understand how it made billion dollars also don understand how the black widow presence in the final battle largely aerial one wasn like bringing knife to gunfight don like captain america in his own movie too he is not powerful and the actor is completely disappointing in the role 5 6 superheroes to fight against halfly retarded villain only hulk did provide some entertainment loki had something to do in thor that was better movie than this ', ' great movie with surprising amount of humour with enough samual jackson to make any fan of his work very happy ', ' impeccable acting characters writing and so on it surreal how masterpiece like this can exist but it does if you weren into superheroes before this show will change your mind because of how well conceived it is ', ' loved the movie everything was great the plot twists the acting the characters everything the were few cringy jokes here and there but some of them very pretty funny too one of the top 5 mcu movies in my opinion ', ' don even know where to begin these writers really don know how teenagers talk or act and it shows the direction they re going in makes it hard to watch unfortunately there a lot of poor writing cringe moments confusing themes overall not making the experience for the viewer entertaining in the slightest way ms marvel could be completely axed out of the mcu and no one would even remember that how forgettable it is currently adding nothing of value to any other storyline you have to turn off your brain for far too long too even think its good show worth watching cheep show irritating characters and no passion in this project whatsoever ', ' okay ll break it down into pros and cons pros 1 the characters are true to themselves 2 it has an easy to follow plot 3 there are lots of good one liners 4 there good chemistry between the heroes 5 the action and special effects are pretty cool 6 it has good pacing the movie continues to build momentum towards satisfying ending 7 it develops nice sense of fun and excitement average 1 the acting and music were fine but nothing special cons 1 loki is an underwhelming villain although often amusing 2 the movie starts slow 3 some of the dialogue is pretty hokey especially fury 4 it lacks emotional impact or deeper meaning 5 there are some dodgy plot holes 6 it not very original similarities to transformers 3 speaking of not very original 1 there are giant alien metal monsters smashing through buildings 2 portal is opened to another world from tall building 3 an alien army swarms in through this portal 4 the good guys desperately try to close this portal 5 there are evil flying shooting futuristic things 6 good guy steals one of these evil flying shooting futuristic things and uses it for good 7 we see new york in mess cars upside down or on fire dust and shrapnel everywhere people screaming and running in summary the avengers is impressive in the way it manages to hold itself together usually this many characters would be guarantee of an awful movie but here somehow all the heroes are given their chance to shine and it works pretty well but far out michael bay should probably be filing lawsuit ', ' good story and production values capped off by an array of really nice looking coats ', ' excellent clever camera work and effects but this is definetely aimed at dropping the age of the viewer pity won be watching if disney make this essential for the mcu then m going to miss story pieces which is regrettable ', ' am so pleased they got this right it could so easily have been slapstick and unbelievable but it works and works very very well the characterisation is solid with good acting from some very competent actors the grainy grubby look from the comic is there in spades and it is as good as the best of the batman films without the big budget there is some good interplay between the main characters and their relationships and personalities work well together lot of other reviews go into details about each character and the actor playing that role all will say is no actor stands out as they are all very good and simply fit together good directing acting and scripwriting what more is there to say watch it ', ' this show seems like it trying too hard to be mysterious cool artsy the mystery to me is how did it get such high ratings am almost to the end of episode 2 and just don have the will to go on the pace and atmosphere is weird and the dialogue stiff and jerky like an old locomotive hope she helps hope and destroys kilgrave and gets together with luke and everyone lives happily everafter but just can see wasting my time while it all happens addendum the way rate shows usually don review anything less than 7 because 6 would be failing grade and won waste my time watching it m old don know how much time ve got left since probably turned it off before getting even halfway through an episode it wouldn be fair to rate or review it 7 is watchable but may go while between episodes since though somewhat entertaining there are other shows more interesting or compelling 8 would be regular in my lineup 9 is must see and probably bingeable 10 is just the epitome of superbity and headed for my all time favorites list m adding this to my reviews because it seems there are lot of binary reactions to pretty much everything these days am not like unlike kind of guy see lot of grays so if give something 10 it doesn mean the only alternative is 1 ', ' so skipped seeing this in theaters because the trailer looked bad well movie finally came out on digital and gave it shot wow what waste of time 1 the chemistry between the three main starts monica cap marvel and ms marvel isn very good it feels really forced and cheesy even with monica and cap marvels connection in the mcu you didn really feel the chemistry with monica as an adult 2 so many scenes were pain to watch as they felt very cheesy or just so dumb that it crossed line nearly stopped when they come across species of people who don talk but sing to communicate it was like watching never ending musical so corny that nearly turned off the movie 3 the villian was just so boring that you honestly didn care they weren scary their acting was awful and you found yourself falling asleep when they were on the screen this movie honestly felt like made for tv movie but for maybe preteens or kids it was cringe and cheesy so often that lost interest and began looking away from the screen out of bordem they didn really fill in much for the characters predicament aside from oh you all have the same sort of powers so thus this is why said stuff is happening like seriously thats it it ashame because enjoyed captain marvel the movie and loved monicas growth from that movie and wanda vision as for ms marvel obviously she is meant to target teen girls more then anyone else but she is kind of uninteresting character with kind of lame powers and her acting wasn exactly great perhaps the only good thing that came out of this movie was the flurken alien cat scene near the end that won ruin it was kinda cute and of course the mid credit scene was amazing so would say to watch this movie not really if you are like me and watch every mcu project to keep up with the story overall d say go look at synopsis of this movie and save yourself the time even at 1 hour and 40 minutes long it felt like it wouldn end was already dead inside about 20 minutes in with the exception of loki season 2 mcu just continues to spiral down hill felt he only hope at even saving it is the men and fantastic four being introduced at some point very painful to sit through who made this ', ' the production is best show is best cox is best fo netflix for cancelling this show ', ' marvel one shot the consultant during the first phase of the mcu marvel released these very short pieces to help bridge some of the other gaps or connect characters that might have been forgotten about in the consultant there is talk that the abomination from the incredible hulk 2008 was being considered to be an avenger obviously that doesn happen but it cute to see rerun of tony stark talk with general ross in the bar from the end of that movie comic books are well known for telling vast stories that can last decades but every once in while one shot book will be released just to paint fuller picture there are others and will review them in the order that they were shown to audiences this one took place between thor and captain america the first avenger ', ' it bad not terrible felt like was watching bad icarly ripoff with very little character depth to speak off it looks like to be aimed at young children or teens the cast is fine and also do just fine with the shallow material they are given set design editing and animations show that there were very competent people involved but that does not save the series from mediocrity ', ' man this show is bad which confuses me the creative force behind firefly serenity and alien resurrected has painfully misplaced the proverbial ball of all the corny cheesy and lame elements that could make up show this one has it all one dimensional barbie doll actors truncated script that goes nowhere pervasive banality anticlimactic plots and perhaps worst of all it just plain boring and that is when you know show is bad when the imagined image of sand dune suddenly arrests your attention in the middle of the first episode those subtle light brown undulations why are they ore intriguing more enveloping and engaging than this retarded turd just can stand it all that creative freedom talent money and air time gone to waste it almost made me want to smash my tv to bits to me good tv will elicit two basic things feelings and imagination this relentless yawn fest elicits lobotomy like haze and the feeling one gets after few hours at the dmv sort of gnawing restless fatigue that eats away at your very soul think the original starship troopers minus the action novelty passion and humor and it is then that you will arrive at the yawn inducing mediocrity of agents of shield sorry joss love ya miss ya wish you could make serenity again ', ' highly recommend great character development and story line ', ' the marvels is film that seems to play it safe but unfortunately it ends up feeling bit flat the villain is your typical bad guy without much depth or originality making it hard to get invested in the conflict the plot follows familiar formula with predictable twists and turns that don offer much excitement or surprise however there is one aspect of the film that stands out the teleportation powers these abilities add some much needed excitement and intrigue to the story making for some cool action sequences and clever plot points it a neat gimmick that adds layer of fun to an otherwise uninspired movie overall while the marvels has its moments it doesn quite live up to its potential with generic villain and predictable plot it struggles to leave lasting impression but if you re fan of superhero movies and cool powers it might still be worth checking out for the teleportation scenes alone ', ' m so open for every marvel series know disney try to make difference in every series but this one go to totally wrong way focus of the story mainly in the background of their ancestor and pakistan culture and that the problem when many marvel fan want to watch marvel hero series but director writer want to present other story they think it work but it not the last episode will be on air in the day after tomorrow not like other marvel series don eagerly wait to watch even little ', ' well let start with the main character itself jessica jones as prototype she has got everything to be strong female character she is very strong she is bit of no nonsense bad ass who do what she is pleased to do she is highly independent persona however she is terrible she never uses her power unless in right way there are literally hundreds of moments in show when it is obvious that she would be able to solve all the problems she faces using her extreme skills instead all she does is destroy lock on doors fight in bar with some random folks get to her friends apartment while watching show could not help but wonder why she is not knocking possessed folks unconscious considering how strong she is and how easily she can do it without killing them what might be the reason for that maybe because is just plain dumb well there is nothing wrong with being not intelligent thor and captain america for instance are not certainly among the smartest folks around but they still manage to be quite likable characters the biggest problem that jessica jones is supposed to be better than this she is private detective after all and presumably she is good at it yet still she manages to amaze with lack of logic of her decisions to makes matters worse her morality is quite conflicted as well she probably cares about people at least she says that numerous times but she clearly do not treat them well understand that she is supposed to be cool but she ended up being more of irritating character rather than likable one probably showing her before encountering kilgrave will talk about him later more than in one scene would be better since it would help to understand depth and history of her character better some movies solve this problem by having their heroes talk about their past and their values to show what they are really like for example in clint eastwood gran torino we first see quite unlikable man who later would show that he has heart and sympathy despite of what war and his kids has done to him which makes him more interesting and deep character instead jessica jones just leaves bad aftertaste actually there is very interesting and good character brilliantly played by david tennant whom majority of people would recognize as former doctor who really think that he should play villains more often he portrays kilgrave very strong and charismatic mind controller who messes with minds of everyone around him who also has quite good back story he is like professor but baddie he single handedly produces some of the best moments in show without spoiling anything scene in police station and elevator observing him really could not help but feel that the guy like this deserves better opponent that jessica jones in nutshell for those who have not watched this show would not suggest to watch it since despite having high ratings it was quite disappointing show with lot missed opportunities which is shame given the resources they had ', ' the first season was really great solid performances and great story score 9 10 the second season has good start but devolves fast into weak plot character development seems to have stalled the new additional main character comes off as uninvolving and flat to me have forgot about continuing seeing this season several times not good score 6 10 ', ' maybe this isn meant for 17 year but it felt really cartoonish or for an audience of age 11 or below the dialogues and story felt forced one could keep watching to feel some connection but it just doesn come felt like another bland character quality of marvel web series have gone down steadily from wanda vision being best to ms marvel just don understand those who have rated this 10 it certainly nowhere near wanda vision ', ' the plot is just brilliant it not common to see millitary conspiracies shows on v but the punisher did great job at it every character is unique with deep personalities and reasons to do what they do the action in this show is brutal and exciting but the show exagerates everything so it doesn make the viewer feel sick because cannot imagine how unbearable this show could be if it was little more realistic the only complain have is jigsaw face in season 2 he needed to be more ugly with more scars ', ' people who are rating it bad are stereotypical extremists and ignorant people it is great of marvel to be portraying indian and pakistani culture together and beautifully making us feel more alike there no part of the movie tht some shud be offended by ', ' one more marvel or maybe not despite strong themes like trauma rape and violence this production is little too thin to last the full 13 episodes the plots subplots and character development simply is not enough this first season in the series would have benefited from shorter 6 8 episode run the acting is somewhat uneven perhaps suffering bit from the thin script with sometimes stunted dialogue and theatrical style acting since the actual cast in most scenes except the final is relatively small perhaps stronger actors and more populated would have delivered better credibility and more intense performance the set is typically netflix usually with few actors in most scenes crisp photo with blurred back acting 4 10 production 6 10 script 4 10 overall 4 10 fell asleep several times the protagonist is too monotone in her acting support cast underperforms due to thin script ', ' this show is really fantastic and every actor has done justice to their respective roles amazing first episode setting the tone for the entire season although every episode is well paced but some scenes feel like they could ve been better but overall the show is amazing and displays every culture greatly iman vellani has done superb job so excited for the upcoming ms marvel projects ', ' this has nothing to do with race or religion this is just bad effort it got high rotten tomatoes score as they are trying to be politically correct bad acting poor action sequences and dialogue and too much focus on her family and friends why change her powers from the comics as well the only thing that actually mate her interesting was replaced by poor special effects ', ' the idea of this show is amazing loved how it presented cultures and families that are never the center of these movies just wish they had been more attentive to the plot as they were with the culture behind it the series lack continuity we don understand how the characters show up where they do and why they re doing what they re doing we can even know why it all began in the first place and who are these evil people some information are just thrown to us and we have to accept it because it doesn go any further know it a teen show but it marvel they create dozens of movies linked to each other and yet this series seem to lack exactly this ', ' so many people hating on this show simply because they can see past their own bias and clouded perspective this show has various representations of culture and backgrounds marvel has been approaching various projects with new mindset and creative vision this series is more comedic and modern as opposed to the usual action packed adventure that fans are used to they have changed some things from the comic but that doesn make it inherently bad don hate the show just because it not what you re used to ', ' m sorry but it was literal fever dream more of parody than real movie ', ' love mcu love black widow but knew she couldn carry her own film movie was boring didn add anything to future films shows fianc had to keep waking up it a bit hard to believe that between civil war infinity war that black widow was doing all this seemed forced ', ' black widow may not be the comedy filled scripting that we see in avengers thor iron man but that doesn mean it any short of good action movie very strong choice of female protagonists and story that transcends the value of girl in our society the story is worthy alone of how exciting the origins and depth of black widow male viewers may not like it as much as other marvel movies but this movie really struct cord for the female demographic wish that black widow had tv series to expand more of the character how how scarlet is kinda of overlooked of the avengers this might be action pack movie but the story really puts perspective of some social issues that need to change hold this movie very dearly more than any marvel movie watch it ', ' this is the most bad ass movie have ever seen each hero gets enough time to be developed and the you will be on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie one of the things that helped this movie was all the main heroes were in their own movies so they could be given back story this was good idea cause doing back story for all of them in one movie would have been impossible it has bunch of memorable scenes that make you love the characters even more the final fight scene is definitely the best part were they finally are together to make their stand against the enemy it does have some minor flaws but this movie definitely makes up for all the flaws some people thought this movie would be bad because of too many heroes in the same movie but if anything this proves you can make movie with all these different heroes and be awesome if they make justice league movie after this they need to get joss whedon to make it cause he definitely knew what he was doing and believe he the only one that knows how to make movies like this so awesome ', ' saw the trailer and was in an impression of it being another teen show mixed with marvel vibes so didn go in with much expectations and that might just be the reason that it worked kamala khan makes her entry in mcu with much of show with flying scarf the show till now seems to be mainly focused on her struggles being muslim teen superhero in conservative family and must appreciate the actors were casted with perfection playing the role with their heart in it the cinematography is beautiful and hindi music sets the vibe for kamala khan ms marvel powers shown seems to be very similar with that of green lantern in dc but it yet to see how they explore her in future episodes edit decreased my rating from 7 to 4 stars after surviving through complete season skip this one it so cringy and illogical and random ', ' some years ago thought that the eternals was the worst marvel movie ve ever seen was wrong this one has no scenario has weak characters has poor visual effects and horrible villain it was waste of time even my 11 year old daughter was bored at the cinema put an 1 at my ranking because for two reasons first one for the only bearable character in the movie that was the kitty flerken and secondly because couldn put 0 am great marvel fan but after endgame something is going wrong hope they can see it soon and return to the old good productions until then avoid movies like this ', ' good thing the show does is gives us the story of man behind the punisher frank castle we learn all about him his friends foes and his family but who we don get to see is the punisher we were used to in the comics heck he barely or rarely even wears the iconic shirt with the skull on it all we get are the struggles of an ex marine named frank castle not the grittiness and brutality of the punisher ', ' when heard neflix was giving the punisher his own tv show just remember jon berthnal relentless insensitive blood thirsty frank castle and the awesome confrontations with comic book characters in daredevil season 2 and was beyond excited but to my surprise saw more punisher in daredevil than on his own show episode one promised season packed of action shootouts blood mobs and heartless punisher which didn happen or as much as anyone expected instead they went for compassion love and sympathy the rest of the episodes until the last two episodes where you could get glimpse of the punisher but even then it was always about frank castle and struggling with his emotions in civilized manner in my opinion as fan of the punisher and speaking for all the die hard fans too we wanted more of what what promised in daredevil less sympathy and more pulling the trigger ', ' firstly have been reading through the reviews and seen lot of 1 10 we are all allowed our own opinion that right but seriously attacking those who liked this and in their valid opinion gave it 10 10 makes you look like you are some sort of film god whose opinion is the only that matters have given this 10 because think it is that all that matters really if you think it a fair enough just don attack others so why is it 10 for me because have waited for the comic genre to finally be made to the highest level using the technology which allows the universe created on paper to become reality the depth of story or character doesn matter it a romp and an adventure and just as my dad enjoyed saturday morning episode cinema because it was escapism so is this the 10 comes from the way it makes me feel like kid again without the issues that impact life and make you stressed this isn a comparison with the godfather or shawshank etc it a mark which reflects the personal opinion have about how impressed was and how much enjoyed my 2 1 2 hours of pure escapism ', ' the first season was very good but the 2nd and 3rd seasons are incredibly boring with some of the worst acting you will see there is too much focus on trish in the 3rd season it got so boring just stopped watching just go ahead and cancel this show ', ' this show started off good but thanks once again to the the abc tv network have quit watching it abc really knows how to turn it viewers off by having such an irregular viewing schedule it comes on with new season and shows few episodes then it gone for couple weeks then back again for 1 or two shows then it gone again for month or two you have 22 24 episode stupid networks show the episodes and be done with it then put your new mindless shows on after the season is finished for current show and you wonder why ratings are down and people are pulling the plug on cable satellite you suck abc ', ' this show is absolutely brilliant am marvel fan and enjoyed this far beyond anything else marvel related started watching with no real expectations and it blew me away it dark the action is great acting is spot on ridiculous that it got cancelled especially when you see some of the trash that gets renewed ', ' started watching this show and immediately turned off the tv after half of the second episode ve never felt such genuine anger on how the way they botched this character in the way that the show also feels like your supposed to root for her but just want to watch her fail ', ' alright well here we go an abc original show might contain some spoilers m not sure why exactly decided to watch this but because wanted to see the entire mcu franchise as intended suppose that was really the underlining reason but regarding this show at least first impressions seriously regarding the first half of season 1 who writes this mean the jokes are just cringe the show starts off very tacky lot of dumb humor everywhere ridiculous scenarios if you think too much into it ect just lot of corny nonsense with sprinkles of cool material cause after all it is set in the mcu lot of the characters were bit annoying plot holes regarding one of the most intelligent agencies being one of the stupidest agents of all time clarke gregg and couple other characters were okay although the humor doesn land very well between them usually chloe bennet character sky was probably one of the worst aspects of the show imo her character is seen as an annoying cringe comedian throughut this first half of season 1 plus with every turn she tried to lie and deceive everyone hate that this show tries to make you feel bad for her even though she does it all to herself ming na wen character the calvary on the other hand is one of the greatest characters in this show though she is just absolutely bada and great demeanor to her but really all of these negatives go out the window near the end of season 1 idk what they did maybe got new writers but the shows improves excessively with twists interconnection with captain america the winter soldier and honestly some of the characters had problem with started to grow on me by time you re into the middle of season 2 you re infinitely hooked in this entertaining dynamic show that gets rid of that boring one off plot stories like generic crime buddy cop shows and uses complex characters like ward to become one minute good guy and the next using power for his own gain regarding the story the introduction of sky becoming an inhuman was very interesting and honestly as time went by and around the end of season 2 she becomes one of my favorite characters how they made one of the worst characters become one of the best have no idea but it happened and was very impressed with this show going into season 3 the show becomes almost nonstop t show everyone who had this gene that eats fish or fish oil become in humans worldwide which sparks an huge influx of work being done by the crew ward coming back as hive was such weird introduction to keep the character alive and kept this fresh ward betrayed too many times he lost his word all of those promises he made about using a i i is gone and it about time coulson took care of it such bittersweet moment then season 3 finale happened we see the end of hive and ward in way too and of course lincoln being noble character he was really misunderstood character that should of been treated better getting into season 4 we get season sectioned off in 3 parts the first one was daisy who finally is known as quake meets up with man who made deal with the devil the ghost rider this character was different rendition than nicholas cages and better for it the story they wrap around him his uncle was interesting enough with some pretty cool moments the 2nd part of the season ramps up big time having an conspiracy involving ai lifelike robots lmds pretty much take over h e d covertly this introduces aida which think did wonderful job showing an ai that goes little haywire the 3rd part involves aida putting the shield agents into simulation while her robot replicas take over this part was probably my favorite part of the season having mostly all the agents stuck in this what if simulation where hydra runs the world this is where lot of characters start to loose themselves which thought was really interesting to see also this redeemed ward 100 now season 5 probably the darkest and personally my favorite season of the entire series it kinda split in 2 parts the first half of the season set in supposed future where quake destroyed the world and the second part where they go back to the current timeline to stop the world being split in 2 now the first half was definitely cool introducing us to plenty of new characters most notable deke who happens to be fitz and simmons future grandson now the futrue is grim one in this timeline showing kree basically running things at earths space stations some cool kree characters although they didn last the second part is my personal favorite basically they go back to the present timeline and lot of stuff happens but the main overacher is that general talbut wants to become this hero that can stop and destroy the destoryer of worlds which technically becomes him after he uses gravitonium to become empty shell of person like said lot of stuff happens like the introduction of ruby hydras future leader and few others but will say the last couple episodes were some of the most engaging ve seen yet now with season 6 things are changed up bit with coulson returning as sarge character who posses coulson body now this character was pretty interesting with many layers to unravel this season mostly is about sarge and his teams quest to find and kill izel who is basically 4th dimensional creature that can inhabit anyone body and control them before she can destroy the planet it all around somewhat confusing mysterious season that doesn reveal things until later in the season izel was very menacing villain coulson antihero villain arc was extremely awesome and refreshing and honestly satisfying season that teases the final season spectacularly now season 7 the final season watching this season was so much fun and rewarding as this season has our shield agents stuck in time jumping zephyr giving different era vibes with mostly each season now sadly most the season has fitz mia which kinda hurt the overall vibes of the last hoorah season but the story he serves is by far more important than fan service anyways the season ties up lot of loose ends the series and even the agent carter show never got to tie up with some surprise character appearances also we finally get the last hoorah with coulson once again even though he technically lmd it still felt like ole classic agents of shield again the villains of this season did good job keeping the stakes high with both the chromicons and hydra founders working together to basically wipe out shield seriously this was basically infinity war engame to the agent of shield show and it definitely serves up exactly what was awesome about the show the ending was bittersweet as m not entirely sure we ll see these characters again in the mcu but shoot this was good enough in all despite one of the most annoying seasons ever to be made in television history season 1 this series found its footing and served up imo one of the best character arcs in the mcu long live agent coulson and long live h e d highly recommended ', ' one for he comic book fans guess that where the high score comes from obviously dry murderous humour and bloody gore in strange setting even for marvel universe it doesn fit in so don really get it ', ' season one is brilliant trip through the mind of serial control freak and the chaotic mis adventures of sam spade style detective humor pacing and story structure all 10 season two is just directionless mess with poor pacing and crap dialog not sure what the difference is between season 2 but please wright the ship because season 2 sucks ', ' marvel had my huge respect until this show they didn reach indians respect for such minimum credits to based on india they should have brought more indian actor more regional language more regional peoples ', ' have to admit my expectations were not high but the really fell below the bar no chemistry with the cast everyone trying to hard it painful to watch dialogue bad jokes not funny so many terrible bits of bad guy dialogue it begins to sound repetitive blah blah blah let get him sadly 2 good likable actresses are wasted in this production rosario dawson is cringe worthy repeating her lines deborah ann wohl of true blood feels unnatural in her role like they forced me to hang out with this guy and laugh make funnies worst of all the lead is ineffectual you feel nothing for his monotone delivered lines poorly executed unexciting fight scenes netflix may have come in hot but daredevil lands cold no sizzle you just don care about anyone no atmosphere poor sound design awful crummy cinematography equally bad visuals see the ben affleck extended cut by steve johnson it far superior that all ', ' truthfully don have rating for this series have been so excited waiting for this series to release watching the first few seconds of the first episode was awkward and uncomfortable but let that slide thinking it was one off thing but 2 3 through the first episode it got way too explicit honestly you might as well be watching an rated film the story line was not as strong daredevil felt like this show was bit rushed and that it was experimenting with how far they could push the limits with the amount of explicit content it can show would strongly recommend that you don watch jessica jones unless you don mind graphic scenes however would recommend everyone to watch daredevil overall fell like this series was big let down ', ' to cover of smells teen like

samuel jackson head of defence agency h i d is thrown into action when powerful device called the tesseract is stolen by loki tom hiddleston the renegade son of odin and wicked god banished for his nature he calls all the superheroes together from around the globe to unite as one to save the earth but upon loki capture they start to question their assignment and whether they re being told the whole truth superhero movies seem to be the in thing at the moment the big studios still requiring guaranteed fan base and surefire box office return in these recessionary times and so some bright spark in the marketing department had the foresight to imagine them all coming together as one supposing the ardent fans would go crazy and flock in droves to the theatres to catch it while personally prefer the action films more grounded in reality there is still young boy in me who can still find an appeal in the flashy suits and fantasy adventure it says lot that avengers assemble where all the big marvel comics names with the exception sadly of the punisher whose antics would probably have been too violent for family film manages to be more of an exhilarating thrill ride than all the films from recent times that inspired it joss whedon has crafted colourful flashy sensory extravaganza that brings the characters to life in ways none of their first recent outings could and never manages to drag at quite bit over two hours working together as one the gang manage to be more effective than they ever could on their lonesomes forging an unwitting chemistry together as events roll on while you can never shake the feeling there a part of them that would still like to rip each other throats out luckily whedon never forgets to inject the script with flashes of humour at regular intervals resulting in material that never takes itself too seriously unlike maybe some of the original films which sets it on the right track while the all star cast all manage to bring their respective characters to life in their own way it probably robert downey jr as tony stark iron man who steals the show firing off wise cracking charisma through out that makes him stand out while scarlett johansson is an alluring femme fatale and hiddleston is hissable villain meanwhile other big name stars like jeremy renner and mark ruffalo are pushed further back and occupy less screen time but casting aside the main thing here the action and special effects are appropriately spectacular and round off probably the most satisfying film ve seen in this series ', ' what bunch of losers jessica jones is big disappointment as much as liked punisher and daredevil hated jessica really felt wasting hours on this pathetic what she was trying to save eventually dies then she is just big time loser not hero nothing heroic in this series waste of time writer and director must be doing time pass ', ' special effects were great plot line ok spoiled by wooden acting of some of the cast robert downey jr as stark was the best part of the film he made it 100 more watchable as soon as he appeared on set couple of one liners added few laughs but overall m glad it was free movie on foxtel and didn waste my cash on movie ticket the villain was ok though he did remind me of grimma wormtongue from lord of the rings who was much better bad guy thor well sorry he and captain america just weren very good actors in this movie you just didn endear to their characters the hulk guy was ok he played good dr david banner ', ' who would think that mcu films could be so boring lost an hour and half of my

generation immigrant ve never felt so connected with the protagonist like this and don know anything about girls or pakistan don even like captain marvel that much amazing actress pretty cool story shown with beautiful sounds and colors marvel has been quite lackluster recently but this one genuinely got me excited thank you so much for everyone who participated in creating this and look forward to more content from ya ll ', ' get ready to watch an adrenaline filled movie that will control your heartbeat with its impressive story visual effects and wonderful performances of the actors ', ' disney has made zoey 101 ms marvel show character doesn even have her real power complete garbage don waste your time on formulaic same trash like this show watch stranger things or west world season 4 or basically anything else ', ' one of the best what shame for canceling good story good acting thats mistake ', ' so boring no russian person wanted to be in this movie obviously no dialect coaches either mila jovovic daughter was good touch but too short screen time ', ' first season was awesome and left me expecting for second one sadly was not even able to finish the second season only first two episodes were good then is all downhill until episode 7 were just could not stand it anymore it felt like watching soap opera with 2 really annoying characters no real action and soften and handsome villain that for some reason has nothing to do with the original one ', ' as marvel series it lacks substance might say something is just missing if its drama on its own and not part of the marvel universe will say im actually quite intrigued by the storyline aspect of the series where we come to learn about the culture history and religion in pakistan this hence will not speak well with

international peacekeeping agency known as h e d finds himself in need of team to pull the world back from the brink of disaster spanning the globe daring recruitment effort begins marvel the avengers is good not great the film does its job in entertaining the audience but not much more it has some great action scenes some truly funny moments and some drama but overall it cannot be compared to the top superhero films which includes the incredibles the dark knight and spider man 2 for me it a popcorn flick and if that what you re expecting then you ll be satisfied as joss whedon fan expected much more from the film than it just being entertaining felt the whole dysfunctional family aspect could have been executed better and expanded to be more significant portion in the film there was only one scene where the tension between the superheros can be felt but that about it the film also could have used bit more heart as felt the whole team working aspect to be lacking in the emotion area additionally the story seems to be overdone by now villain wants power and tries to take over the world maybe something different would have been more engaging however apart from those flaws the avengers is good film the key success is due to the superheros themselves and how effectively whedon manages to balance each of the characters without having one overshadow the other out of all of them the hulk played by the talented mark ruffalo is my favorite he seriously has some of the most memorable moments in the film robert downey jr is great as well as of now downey pretty much nails his role as the egotistical yet charming tony stark black widow played by scarlett johansson also gets some great moments in here which is good since she the standout female character in the film however felt they could have done more with captain america and thor additionally although he utilized better in this film than in thor wanted different villain than loki overall the avengers is fun popcorn flick that starts the summer season but not with big bang as hoped for the film could have used bit more external conflict between the superheros as well as more emotion however the film doesn take itself too seriously and the 2 5 hour running time really flies past you before you know it think of it like better version of transformers 3 ', ' its not look like marvel franchise series wrost series ever made by mcu hope they don release sesone 2 watch every movie and series of marvel universe and m biggest fan but after watch this im really sad hope mcu comming with something new ', ' the sound mixing is so bad so bass heavy that can hardly understand any of the dialog its all blurred out by music and artificial sound effects wish hollywood would stop this godawful practise ', ' where is the story line where is the direction and what about the starcast what kind of selection is done kamala don know acting her friend her mom brother on other side is good actor kamala as in lead role dosent fit at all seriously when the casting is in final stage the director must be on to something high dose and while directing again he uses same stuff this is not expected by mcu please do stop making any further videos ', ' was so looking forward to season two film noir style detective show with superhero scifi twist all the promise and coolness gets drowned out by propagating very liberal

immigrant shop owner afraid to go to police when criminals target his business etc anti marriage heavy lesbian overtones anti white male white males are all harvey weinsteins honorary mentions of climate change etc it reminds me of how all the fun and entertainment was taken out of supergirl as it became liberal propaganda machine when will the liberal screenwriters stop ruining perfectly good scifi series and refrain from painting anyone who disagrees with their politics as morally inferior ', ' think it really cool for marvel to be making so many girl super hero come to life in the mcu all forget that this is coming of age show and think expected it to be worse the first episode is great ', ' marvel movies are getting worse and worse m superhero marvel and dc fan but have to say why who thought this movie was necessary liked the captain marvel it wasn the best but watchable but this what can say that hasn been said already this should have been nickelodeon movie kids would like this but not feature movie the writing was bad action so so if you haven seen ms marvel or secret invasion you will be lost the jumping from one scene to the other was horrible it almost as if the studio had some extra money and threw this together to spend it 4 of us watched it and we all said 20 minutes into it this is bad ', ' there was time when disney produced great family entertainment then they took turn where they decided to attack everything walt disney believed in you can see it coming where instead of talking up the great story they lead by attacking fans who may not like the movie and call them names if they don see the movie ', ' the action in this movie is amazing it was wonderful experience and can wait to see what marvel has to offer with the rest of there movie and shows ', ' daredevil has been my favorite marvel hero for long long time really enjoyed ed brubaker series and the art that went long with it even the stuff more recently with mark waid has been fantastic and one of the top series marvel had so when the show was announce was ecstatic the ben affleck movie had it moments and the director cut was much better than the theatrical but it like 4 10 becoming 6 10 it still wasn the right tone and for sure had all of the early 2000 super hero tropes binged the first half of the first season and enjoyed it there were stretches didn really like but overall it was the best interpretation of the character it was drama first and foremost not the usual marvel big budget movie it was smaller story of hero who took care of important things though smaller in scope to the avengers world saving fell off and didn finish the first season until recently was not into it for bit but it might have been because had been gone for so long the second season was bit of slow start with the punisher stuff but about 3 episodes in it gets really damn good so good watched 5 episodes back to back good it exciting that they are bringing the hand and elektra into the story with the punisher being the secondary plotline season 2 is really damn good and really love it can wait to watch season 3 as soon as possible it is shame it was cancelled but hopefully disney will revive it ve heard really mixed stuff about the defenders but will probably force myself to watch that as it continues the hand storyline ', ' today watched the literal worst grossing marvel movie which was also incoherent and often stupid dumb and embarrassing to the point of being funny for starters this movie is less boring than the captain marvel movie which guess is something but to be blunt hated that movie too most of why it less boring is cause it really really stupid it also makes captain marvel not as much of unlikable character and tries to make her not completely awful person to root for the problem starts with this actually like carol danvers in all other instances of this character is totally rude and awful even in this movie it acknowledges this character being like literally monster it just takes completely different personality of character and puts it on captain marvel it just pretends like she somehow developed conscience empathy and disregards her being dookie butt whatever who needs consistency speaking of consistency this movie couldn even be consistent with its own tones it trying to be serious it trying to be funny and it tries to make you think what youre watching is super awesome it fails at all of those things intentionally every single time every instance of humor was either extremely cringe or very dumb low hanging fruit the movie will attempt to make jokes during the very serious scenes which are never funny and are often entirely clashing with how we re supposed to be feeling one time it even did this thing where it went into an animation that was kinda neat but it literally never did it ever again just lot of questionable tones and stylistic choices that clash constantly sidenote the acting sucked across the board brie larson kept doing this thing where her eyes were just bulging out of her head and she was just super surprised by everything it actually ended up being very wooden the other two main characters were also bad but thought the character who played the niece was particularly awful not single word the entire movie felt natural and she was probably my least favorite person to watch the main villain was hilarious her costume and personality makes her look like daenyrs targaren season 8 style and she is just so over the top the entire movie she reminds me of eddie redmayne from jupiter ascending or maybe even troll 2 witch it hilarious to watch her lick her lips and give goofy expressions when looking at her weapons after they get powered up haven even gone into the story yet man ugh it so bad man basically it just doddles around till the main villain is introduced characters hop around everywhere and it takes them forever to figure literally anything out even though it insanely obvious what happening they just keep having eureka moments like 20 minutes after the audience figures out what happening then often they disregard what they ve learned and conveniently things just start working differently from how they were explained in the movie just for conflict also captain marvel is insanely overpowered and she just keeps being stupid to make things harder she just broken op man there was main conflict in the movie that was just complete red harring again which is obvious but it actually just has nothing to do with the movie seriously there is whole massive ps3 graphics scene that just could be taken out of the movie and it wouldn have changed anything cgi throughout the movie looked really bad but those cgi cats were really some ps3 graphics man the sets often looked fake as heck and looked like plastic or very heavily cgi gummy plastic garbage the music was not very notable but liked the choice to use that skillex song don really remember anything musical besides that song being used even in the scene was often filmed so horribly that couldn tell what was happening and yeah lastly the cinematography was kinda awful it was shaky and looked extremely unprofessional for marvel movie it was often incoherent during action scenes and was edited together poorly overall this movie sucked it was often enough so bad it funny this makes it at least little more entertaining than the extremely unlikable boring snoozefest that is captain marvel think technically speaking that movie is better with this movies incompetence m at least not entirely bored incomprehensible badly acted poorly shot poorly plotted boring music terrible stupid movie haha high 2 10 ', ' movie for 14 o including dialogues waste of time bottom note beautiful women victims of botox ', ' like ms marvel from the comics but don like how they changed her powers and the origin of them the show is pretty cheesy and the acting is meh ll still continue to watch it hoping for it to get better and to keep up on the continuity of phase 4 but don think ll enjoy it much ', ' it seemed there was lot of potential here but it never really got traction the characters do not seem to have stable identity and just kind of go along with whatever and their personality seems to change on whim as for the characters themselves there is severe lack of backstory and one is less well known than another was this supposed to be funny made for kids made for adults it seems lost in itself as for the story itself too many cooks in the kitchen comes to mind not sure about the plot but guess you can pick which one you like the term trying too hard also comes to mind ', ' folks in case you re interested in the new avengers movie don waste your time or money unlike the first installment this has nothing but special effects with disjointed storyline there are explosions in which most caught in the blast radius would get killed but leaves nothing but scratches and little or no blood it almost stupid with lines that are supposed to be funny but are just fill ins for lack of meaningful dialog however the kids in the audience laughed lot which made me realize how out of place was and need to grow up there will be no next time if there is yet another sequel yuck how disappointing ', ' all of these marvel movies are overrated and overhyped probably because people can bare their reality or watching reality based movies that fantasy is driving their lives it took me 3 sittings to finish this movie ', ' one of the best marvel films to date loved every second of it florence pugh is black widows sister and have now fell in love with her haha scarlett did incredible as per usual as well loved the mainly female cast and recommend everyone to watch it ', ' still catching up with mcu know where have been this is an awesome film 10 10 so exciting and seeing all the superheroes together is mind boggling the dialogue between the superheroes when shield get together deliberately goes off in all directions while they work out what to do but it is so intelligently crafted and egos are put aside so they can fight as team technically this is landmark film full of innovation thoroughly enjoyable and one to watch again ', ' anyone who reads the one star reviews should be warned your iq will decrease if you read anyone who hates on ms marvel don understand the idea of someone who hates something so much they spend time out of there day you just flat out hate on show that is funny and cool after watched the first episode m already on board ve been marvel fan since iron man 1 saw that in theaters son checkmystub and this felt as unique as watching that front row center the visuals are incredible so far and the lead actress if hands down fun to watch can wait to see more haters gonna hate but let them hate while you eat your popcorn ps bet all those 1 star peeps haven seen more than minute of the show or better yet just watched the trailer anyone who hates that hard doesn have the patience of quality tv ', ' am russian viewer of the marvel universe movie comics watched with interest how this fantastic superhero world develops was still in high school when first watched iron man really loved this movie was impressed by tony stark charisma and the intelligence and resourcefulness of this hero inspired me so watched how various new cultures are shown in this movie comic universe for example wakanda impressed me the mixture of african culture and cutting edge technologies looks very fresh the asian culture of the marvel universe is filled with mysticism and magic bordering on the aesthetics of martial arts and as russian viewer wanted to see how russia or the ussr itself would appear in this universe so according to the version of the marvel universe russia is creepy cold place in which there are only prisons in russia according to marvel there are only officials who brainwash people and are obsessed with how to overthrow states all over the planet with the help of young women there is not one normal character from russia in the marvel universe natasha romanoff is good character because she is russian american her home is not russia her home is ohio used to like the marvel universe thought that the creators of this universe are tolerant of all nations but judging by this film only russophobes work in marvel m disappointed in the marvel universe expected that in the first solo film about superhero from russia russia will be presented in an interesting way but it all came down to politics ', ' it not often get excited about kick ass films with unknown stars but this had me gripped from episode 1 and now m on episode 4 one thing never do here is ever give away plot or inklings but all can say is get the biggest tub of popcorn big ass drink and sit and be immersed in full on assault by krysten ritter aka jessica jones the first 2 episodes are what you need to get your head around after that it all action david tennant well there a dark man who done well for himself on the american circuit first of all he was over here as dr who bimbleling along and now he a force to be reckoned with lol as with the marvel team what you see is what you get mind over matter so to speak it a very good show and can wait to further my knowledge into the depths of stan lee mind ', ' love this show love the characters love the tone the directing the writing the cinematography the music and especially the fight scenes can see everything they are so clear and well done with some amazing long one take shots the best complement can give this show is that it made me to the full extent of the word love the character daredevil matt murdock season 1 9 stars 4 viewings 12 24 2021 12 31 2023 too awesome captivating well made in every way beastly music so many powerful moments beautiful non linear storytelling one of my favorite villains gg season 2 10 stars 5 viewings 1 6 2022 1 3 2024 amazing exciting well made phenomenal fight scenes intense deep thrilling captivating enthralling elektrafying punishing daredeviling this season masterfully juggles numerous storylines and characters

season 3 9 stars 3 viewings 3 6 2022 1 7 2024 too awesome so suspenseful even in the non action scenes the stakes always feel high super entertaining great music awesome fight scenes and they continue adding great characters like dex and nadeem plus they masterfully demonstrate fisk genius ', ' even if she didn had magical power like the other avengers her movie is still memorable and the cinematography was so good scarlett johansson acting skill is so good in this movie overall this movie was so great and enjoyable ', ' m so confused by all the reviews who score this show 1 10 can ask is marvel always supposed to make shows for adults or shows with darker themes they re certainly not they can make whatever show they want for whatever audience they want from the trailer it was clear that miss marvel was meant for younger audience or for those who are open for this genre so if you don like it then don watch it and give it 1 star because it not meant for you m young adult and very much liked this show so marvel did good job ', ' there not much to be done in only fifteen minute movie but they tried and it worked it was nice thing to see what happened after the chaos of captain america good female power too ', ' the first episode came out to be very interesting one basically didn have so much expectation from this show but after watching was so much into the show ', ' jon bernthal was literally born for this role could not imagine better actor to play frank castle the punisher the show itself is so good every episode is just great and there is so much action going defintley watch it ', ' the movie was lot of fun filled with action and humor scarlet as usual delivered an electrifying performance with her facial expressions and poses which we have grown to love the only thing the movie needed in our opinion was that they should have dwelled more on the character origins of the black widow was also expecting more from the end credit screen on the whole give it 8 10 very enjoyable and speedy comics management team ', ' not the most gripping of marvel films whoever chose ray winston for russian villian one of the most cockney cockney needs speaking to glad didn waste money on cinema tickets ', ' just expecting more but alas it was not season 1 all episodes were slow and not thrilling and jessica jones acting wasn like super hero ', ' was never sold on captain marvel watched it twice and just couldn get into it much there was at least memorable parts though like danvers being either kree or human with fake memories also big factor in why struggled to follow it the flekken taking fury eye and the training scenes between captain marvel and fassender character this one has nothing it has great characters such as monica rambeau ms marvel and fury returning but it just seems to go through the typical marvel motions with literally nothing surprising or compelling about it couldn even finish it coming off the back of duds like eternals and echo the mcu really needed this one to work it didn ', ' it is the film to watch this movie is the best ever superhero film have ever seen was expecting michael bay style movie with nothing but cgi but there is so much more to flashing lights in this movie unlike transformers 2 3 the character clash worked really well as some scenes included just the heroes communicating and interacting the characters were all brilliant with superb cast g downey jr but the actor that stood out the most was none the less than mark ruffalo where has he been all this time this guy fits so well into the clothes of bruce banner as he really portrays the human and the scientific side of the hulk he also shows the battle with him self that he is constantly fighting the hulk in this movie was expected lets be honest to be side character instead he was beast no better the hulk also liked how lou ferigno makes his cameo as the voice of the hulk as for the rest of characters such as iron man captain america and thor they all shared really equally big roles black widow character is not only the pretty face but an extremely shrewd woman perfect woman or is it just me hawkeye the last character like we all expected draws the short straw but not as short as you would expect as he is seen doing some amazing stuff the antagonist loky has great impact in the movie as the contrast of characters between him and thor tony stark and the rest escalates the tension to breaking point the film adopts light hearted feel at times which smooths the film with some light humour the visuals were incredible especially with the hulk transformation finnally we get to see that and the battles would suggest watching iron man iron man 2 thor the incredible hulk and the first avenger find out the order on imdb before you watch the avengers remember if you have not gone cinema to watch it yet stay till the very end unfortunately for me think know how avengers 2 is going to end to find out my imaginary ending search up spider man 1994 episode 57 am not geek nerd and just really like super heroes ', ' if you forget the movie is supposed to be about black widow and try to imagine its just some grade action movie then ll give it 5 stars but as black widow movie gave it 2 and that was generous ', ' not as advertised bree larson is as expected not the right pick for the movie ', ' very average going in didn really know what to expect mcu movies are usually awesome but this one was average the plot wasn that interesting it was too bland and it sometimes fails to explain things so most times don even know what is going on also think that taskmaster had lot of potential but just ended up being an average character that was meh this movie was wasted potential still somewhat liked it definitely not worth premium access though ', ' great alternative marvel show somewhere between the bravado and self importance of iron man bryce and the out and out audacity of deadpool with the violence good comedic tragedy of an animation assassination give it watch for sure ', ' heres an off the grid ex military man weapon bloodthirsty for revenge he will take down any bad guy in the way the thing is he rarely if ever cares about helping anyone unless he can use them to carry out his murder plan hes not hero hes mentally ruined war veteran turned serial killer as with 99 of the marvel netflix shows its well cast and performed great production value never read the comics or graphic novels or whatever so theres that but dont see this as any sort of hero story its all pain and suffering its really dark the logo is quite popular though ', ' m sorry but who is cate shortland and why on earth was this director given 200million dollar movie to direct despite not having ever made good movie this director has made 3 previous movies and all of them are mediocre seriously seriously don know why they gave such massive movie to such an inexperienced director marvel literally only have themselves to blame they are the cause for this movie being bad so let move on from the terrible director choice the movie has several highly unrealistic scenes and by unrealistic mean impossible when the viewer sees an impossible thing happen on screen the viewer is immediately snapped back to reality and realizes that they re watching movie instead of watching an epic fantasy saga play out and ontop of the huge plot holes in the movie also for the love of me can figure out how on earth movie with 200million dollar budget has such bad cgi the cgi in this movie is seriously 2nd rate ve seen movies with 20million budgets have better cgi than this movie has it a pity because wanted black widow movie to be good but marvel simply ensured that this movie could never be better than 6 10 no matter what anyone did even with 200million dollar budget it sad but this movie doesn even warrant single viewing nevermind any repeated ones 5 10 bad movie ', ' watched five or six episodes of the first season and found this show puzzling first off it a show based on superhero universe that doesn have superheroes why is that supposed to be interesting the characters feel generic although ming na is pretty cool and clark gregg is the guy who plays the slightly ridiculous minor executive not the guy who plays the cool team leader that being said it wasn bad in weak season for dramas it was perfectly watchable but it did not hold my interest ', ' rating 3 8 overall complete mess as the movie does not hit on any angles and there are obvious points where the studio interfered with the cut bringing into question what the direction of marvel is going forward very bad direction the cut was just very bad and felt like the studio had major say in how they trimmed it the macro scenes were just very boring and the fight scenes were not engaging at all as she just relied too much on cgi to make it interesting the interpersonal scenes were lacking in the movie as it never felt like it furthered the conflict or the relationships between the characters especially the marvels as there was like only one scene meant for team building it felt like there were many scenes for character building that were cut the direction of actors was very bad because it just felt like none of the cast had any chemistry or felt convincing in the emotional moments of the movie bad to pretty bad acting bad from brie larson very monotonous with her line delivery and just did not carry the movie the way she should ve did not have any chemistry with her castmates pretty bad from teyonah parris kinda forgettable performance cause she felt like an aftermath after the other two marvels pretty bad from iman vellani more of bad writing issue but felt very forced being the teen archetype for the group that made it seem more annoying than playful had some moments where she did shine bad from zawe ashton such forgettable performance as she was just generic villain and not convincing at all pretty bad from samuel jackson put like no effort into the performance and just did not feel as good as his other nick fury performances tries to be the comedic relief character and it fails pretty hard bad from the rest of the cast just stiff forced performances all around and no chemistry in any of the scenes very bad story one of the biggest issues for the movie as it felt like the conflict was not conveyed well at all and was not presented as big issue the personal conflict between the characters was also not handled well at all the story construction was very bad as there practically was no rising action or character developing the conflict introduction was very poor and not good and does not feel like really interesting issue it felt like lot of scenes were cut that could ve added depth to the movie as there were lot of cuts in the story to just move the plot forward but this created lot of questions the character writing was bad for the most part as the characters really aren that interesting at all and their conflicts are not really that compelling though ms marvel was the most interesting as it blended the teen superhero archetype with south asian american background very bad screenplay the dialogue was incredibly cringey and just not good felt like it was written by someone who read synopsis of what marvel movie should sound like and wrote that as their first screenplay the jokes were just very forced and not funny at all the more dramatic elements were funnier with how cringey they were tried way too hard for marvel humor and it rarely hits the south asian vernacular was just more stereotypical than funny and as result just felt very shallow the symbolism was just so shallow and the message was overt for what they were going for the foreshadowing was pretty obvious as the movie was very formulaic decent score felt very similar to other comic book movies pretty bad soundtrack so on the nose that it was laughable decent cinematography pretty good sound similar to other marvel movies adr for the singing was so obvious very bad editing felt super amateur and the cut for the movie was just so bad terrible to very bad visual effects felt so cheap and tacky worse than thor 4 pretty good production design similar to other marvel movies pretty good makeup pretty good costumes plot structure was concern as there were issues with lack of rising action scenes definitely cut and the climax was so short that it felt anticlimactic pacing was so fast that there was no time to take in what was going on the runtime could have definitely been added too to add more depth to the story and slow the pace down climax was super anticlimactic and like felt very formulaic marvel movie tone was incredibly marvel and really tried to go for that teenage marvel feel during the ms marvel moments and both did not hit the mark and dragged the movie down by making it formulaic ', ' d say m surprised it as bad as it is but it from disney they ve been pretty fantastic at destroying everything they touch lately if you enjoy high school dramas with horrible cgi and weak acting this is definitely for you ', ' the most disappointing mcu movie ve seen ever not like m dc fan or mcu hater ve watched almost all the mcu movies in theatre was eagerly waiting for this one as well despite the mixed reviews but just wached it last night was waiting till the end for something big but they just made jude law character joke the only thing liked is jackson throughout the whole movie whatever his screen time was but he did well couldn buy brie larson as capt marvel but she looked beautiful and there is no way she could overpower thor even have high doubts of her against tony kevin feige must be lying about it as they lied before about the title of endgame ', ' people gets mad when someone is objective and tells the truth even it doesnt goes with the masses like always do make my own opinions and reviews and all based on facts so people gets mad of me here because im not d m who goes with the masses and tell the truth really people is becoming less and less smarter each year possers need to start knowing they are wrong going with the masses ignoring reality instead having ur own opinions that wrong if most people were smart my review should have 100 positive accordance but it has 0 so that the reason why we have so many bad movies and shows these days it all based on marketing and go with the masses script cinematography philosophical and smart values are not important anymore that sad people who gave this more than 1 10 are possers this is not even super hero he doesn have super powers hate when ignorant people call super hero to anything the definition of super hero is clear and simple but all the people who ranked this show don understand it hero with super powers mean hellooo it not so difficult that confirmed the show is scam they promoted it like super hero show and it never was and leaving that away it not even good show watched only 5 episodes and it was torture of predictable and repetitive things we ve seen in hundreds of other shows so quitted in episode 5 cause it was torture of boredom anyone who wants to watch real super hero show recommend the gifted that the definition of super heroes and gold ', ' really enjoying the origin story overlayed by authentic pakistani culture and jon watts spider man teen feel to the episodes thus far more importantly my 9 year old daughter loves this show ', ' in the first season they drew out what should have been the last episode into another 4 slow boring episodes the second was also very slow but had few twists that kept it interesting enough to keepwatching from the 4th episode in on the third season they have just drawn out another boring lame excuse for the writers to not even have to think about what they are writing the 9th episode in on the third season quit watching this show and will never watch again to have people with super powers that cant catch or stop killer for 9 episodes of nothing happening and then on 9th she is going to set him free fire your writers and quit trying to make more episodes out of thin air that suck it is more of drama than anything else with the mildest of action ', ' it just seems to be another marvel movie it was very lengthy with long drawn out sequences of action that you would expect from marvel movie every year they come out with new movie and they end up destroying all of new york ', ' didnt like it as bad as the new hawk series lacks content lacks storyline its reallye hard to empathyze with any character probably not going to watch next episode disney lasts shows have beeen like this ', ' was looking forward to this movie when heard they were doing back story on the black widow was excited finally we get to see her arc unfortunately the mark was missed the story line was weak and predictable kind of had an idea what the movie was going to be by the trailers and sure enough it was rachel weiss while love her was wasted in this movie david harbour is awesome but his character was again predictable and while he did provide some comedic relief it was in way out of place newcomer florence pugh was good but also novice and well scarlett johansson was good but ve seen her do better disappointing weak story don waste your money wait until it comes out on disney for free ', ' believe disney should buy the whole marvel anyway cause feels like m on the disney channel 9n tv with my 7 year old cousin who just watches for she sake of it not for entertainment or to watch quality instead of watching marvel show ', ' will be honest this show isn bad but it isn good it has its moments but they could of done way better with the plot the villains and just story telling love what they did ms marvel character like the side characters but the villains was wasted and straight horrible the story dragged lot very cringe made me un interested in the show if had to rate it it a 5 10 but that my opinion wish they exactly made more time in it and had like 7 or 8 episodes for you to fully get to know kamala because she seems rush and they don really explain some plots of the show they just blew off ', ' oh black widow deserve more in marvel universe guys lets make more widows instead that exactly what happens black widow isn the main character the comedian scenes in this movie better than the action scenes the villain character is weak role the cgi graphics is poor like said once you watch it you will realize that the whole movie wasn about black widow it was gate way that allow another characters to enter the marvel cinematic universe got enjoyed the comedian scenes in this movie more than the action scenes they did they role to make us laugh but they didn impress us in action the main key to make action scenes success in marvel world is graphical effects and cgi quality and that something you wont find in this movie at all finally you may love this movie for only 3 reasons 1 the comedian scenes 2 the black widow reputation that built through all 3 you may love that because you miss marvel movies since last one was 2019 but also you may get disappointed many ways and don forget to wait to the after credit scene of course hope you enjoyed my review and get masked be safe ', ' liked how jessica powers are underplayed she rips car door off or crushes padlock like its nothing special like its cheap party trick no big deal jessica detective skills are what she really relies on her powers make things more convenient thats all it does give her more male macho attitude of never having to worry about walking into dark alley jessica fearlessness is as much due to her life sucks noir attitude as her powers though and big part of killgrave threat is that he represents something worse than mire death ', ' so boring as an example in the 4th episode there is an at least 7 minute scene of people walking past the camera at the train station the show seems to me to be very disjointed as well as boring someone said this was like soap opera but soap opera is so much more cohesive in its story telling think it is great that they have true history story being weaved into the larger story but they are not weaving it in well at all it needs something interesting some action start moving something ', ' ve been huge punisher fan since kid when saw him in daredevil was like yessss couldn pick better actor play the punisher it starts off slow but you really get to know the punisher great writers and great acting it worth your time to watch you ll get addicted hope they keep making this ', ' actually don like anything else that they have done other than the defenders which is ok however the daredevil series is absolutely amazing fisk is my favorite but the punisher was great keep doing what you do ', ' the script for this movie really lacks the idea that the marvels get entangled leads to some funny moment but gets stale pretty quickly the biggest problem for the movie is that the villain lacks by writing and by casting like thanos the villain has reasonable motive but frankly you don need an ulterior motive for the villain when selfish one does just fine there is no outsmarting the heroes and for some odd reason the heroes always know which target is next another problem is that no hero in herself is given time and script to be presented in way that the audience could be interested in them ms marvel has the additional problem that she has to be the fangirl all through the movie making jar jar binks look like chill character in comparison ', ' after that boring movie can see why scarlett johansson has announced she is retiring from any future black widow movies obviously she watched and saw how bad it was and made good decision to not continue ruining her career with bad series ', ' just finished watching marvel daredevil i have to say that this is one of the most awesome comic television adaptation after the joke of dc arrow and flash pssh am dc fan boy grew up with justice league and batman animated series darker approach to the comic universe stunts acting casting all at the highest point daredevil mathew is an awesome actor with skills of acting of top notch he plays the character so well his craft as blind person is too awesome and he doesn loose focus at the uneven period of the episodes the glasses helped him as well where as kingpin played by vincent onofrio is at scary level his depth in portrayal of the king of hell kitchen has detailed touch to it the body movement facial expression all are at very high level their younger forms which is attached to the origins of both main actors have played exceptional part as well the casting has been at the top level as both seemed to have the charisma of acting at their disposal and didn made it feel awkward when the real form came at the peak of the episodes the fight scene are performed at mainstream movie level it might get an approval from the master of different craft batman himself both kingpin and daredevil have done their homework and presented realistic art of fighting and violence at the end of the first season the birth of an inch experienced daredevil is shown and birth of new and better version of daredevil is set to take on nemesis like bulls eye all can say at the moment is bring it on the couch is ready and the popcorn as about to get all the justice it deserves ', ' what on earth was that have never left the cinema in the middle of movie especially with how expensive it is nowadays my family and went with no expectations no expectations we had strong feeling it wouldn be good but it was trip to the cinema so we didn mind couldn finish was it superhero film children film or musical have no idea anyone that a fan of the comics is feeling insulted right now an absolute insult to stan lee nothing made sense an absolute mess terrible dialogue which led to even more terrible acting can tell the script was written by ai hated every character as there was no development why did every character seem stupid captain marvel is supposed to be one of the most powerful superheroes and yet was bumbling weak mess felt so childish we ve gone from the iron man films to this mcu is officially dead thanks disney ', ' honestly maybe it better to go watch some cartoon series the avengers or read some comic books about them then watch this movie so much flashing scenes flat and undeveloped characters dull conversions that after half of movie you really start think how can someone glorify this piece of p only good thing is surprisingly solid performance of cobie smulders and tom hiddleston and really good last action fighting scene even if it unconvincing and completely transparent that luckily didn sleep over general observation was be that this kind of blockbusters must have really great and very well elaborated scenery that will naturally lead watcher from individual rampage to team assembly of world greatest heroes the avengers earth mightiest heroes cartoon series showed how to do that in just 90 min hulk is completely lost captain america is to plastic iron man is working his daily shift thor looks like some intruder on private party and nick fury is completely clueless what to do but still everything turns up fine to funny and unconvincing scenery in combination with pail looking main characters can only outcome with disaster called the avengers ', ' this movie is amazing and mind blowing with nonstop action definitely recommend seeing black widow it worth watching give the movie all 10 stars it one of the best marvel movies ever made ', ' this film is totally useless it so boring the bad guy is just mess don lose your time watching this movie ', ' after the dark knight films the best adaptation of hero great story great cast great music how can they only think to cancel this fantastic series ', ' so far the story and script were excellent one of the best tv shows that made me thinking of the writer nice job every statement and word is well thought this covers somehow weak points like how small flame from flamethrower scared off 2 armed policemen very quick agent madani talks need subtitle most of times casting of frank castle was wrong although got used to him he is much tougher than the original punisher who was less muscular but tall and big only ', ' this show just seems to go down hill further and further each episode m feeling more and more less connected with it and it cast the missions the story the back stories the cast the action scenes just don click with it maybe m too old maybe if was kid would probably jump for glee over this but really just don find it entertaining movie cameo are fine but they don make for great show need story and characters can really get lost in and just don with this show m three shows in and think ll give it just one more show and if from their it just doesn grab me even just bit well it one less show for me to care about ', ' very much slow burner liked the 90s setting and young fresh faced nick fury classic 90s songs too but felt it lacked thrill or excitement but second half of movie picked up and much more action and ups it game least we get back story to main character and ties her in to the main storyboard of the avengers movies story line ', ' m little late to the party when it came to watching daredevil on netflix however the fact that finished the show in three days and m still craving more says little something on how addictive in good way this show is let start off with the acting superb all around this is going to sound funny but bare with me charlie cox plays blind amazingly he nailed it on the head and now let talk about vincent onofrio this is how fisk is supposed to look talk feel act keeping up with nailing parts on the head vincent became fisk and did damn fine job at it the characters are believable relatable and all around fun to watch watching daredevil not only kick ass but get his own ass knocked down on the journey you get to see side of fisk that in my mind made him more human he loves he hurts he gets worried he human and not just some monster related to both characters and because of that found myself enjoying the show more small thing but still worth mentioning the opening credits visuals and the music that plays is simply amazing it mesmerizing and addicting humming along if you re fan of the mcu or if you re fan of comics in general or even if you re just fan of watching good v couldn recommend this show enough also keep an ear out for the subtle hints to other characters in the mcu bring on season 2 ', ' ve read some marvel comics but not enough to become fan and this film is average m just too easy what is this is loki the villain that weak maybe he couldn adapt to the earth environment and his army look like they re adopted from transformers what good about this film it 3d nothing more it took me almost week to watch this because it too boring our superheroes their jokes their love line their problem no interesting easily solved end old superheroes formula boring story if you want to kill time go on ', ' really wanted to like jessica jones did do like kristen ritter and she portrays jessica very well the problem is and this exists in both seasons is that they are really in some need of editing the glacial pace and filler really hurts my viewing as each season could have been done in five or six episodes rather than 13 the second season was slower than the first and the big reveal which won reveal here was stretched out bit too long hope that if there is third season they ll tighten things up bit ', ' after watching the first episode just realized this series is very different in story production and vfx artistic approach it something new to experience thank you ', ' couldn find reason to hate this show but also couldn really find reason to love it it bright colourful and has all the makings of disney channel series you put on in the afternoon to entertain the kids however as far as depth of story relevance to the mcu and encapsulating entertainment goes think d recommend to look elsewhere ', ' look m never one for analyzing superhero movies too much they usually fail to impress although the last 2 featuring the individual avengers namely thor and captain america were definitely cause to be hopeful then comes along trailer of avengers containing an impressive ensemble of superheroes thor iron man captain america hawkeye black widow and most importantly the hulk ok so it can either be something or nonsense thought but seriously never thought that would come out of the theater with smile saying that it was totally worth it repeat the summary statement avengers is probably the best superhero movie ever made it has the story which is although not unlike many other such movies but is treated and presented very very well well don know about you but at least me and sizable few million other people loved it the action does not disappoint in the least but instead of making the audience run headlong into it it is built up slowly but surely the dialogs the pace the visuals and the story overall make this one hell of watch seriously you will not be disappointed ', ' loved this movie it is exactly what it should be story about 3 women or people trying to figure out how to work together to achieve something greater given their different abilities m sorry other viewers didn have the same experience and rated the movie negatively this movie not only tells an uplifting story of how teamwork can achieve greater results it ushers in the next generation of the avengers team as ms marvel and captain rambeau experience greater introduction to the mcu there are moments of levity and moments of heaviness in the story that keep viewers engaged throughout ', ' that it if you don know it about the agents of shield led by agent phil coulson is has enough mystery to him to span the entire series while he and just team made inhuman robots chronicoms expert agents deal with kree aliens hydra space time death and magic when debuted people expected avengers the tv show it genuinely the people or agents who set up the scenarios that give life to the events in the mcu m my opinion it more exciting than the disney plus marvel shows way more exciting than the defenders originally produced by netflix all the power gems are explained in detail too it connects to every movie and tv show up to 2020 ', ' matt murdock who was blinded by chemical spill as young boy fights crime as lawyer by day and as vigilante by night despite his blindness he uses his superhuman senses to demolish the criminal organizations terrorizing hell kitchen as disabled person have deep appreciate for stories about handicapped superheroes like matt murdock played by charlie cox in daredevil but the fact that they decided to remake this epic story is certainly not the only reason that must tip my hat to netflix for their recent original series daredevil cannot praise this show enough for its unbelievable fight scene choreography excellent acting and striking cinematography also appreciate that in comparison to most marvel series netflix daredevil adds an element of realism to the story with the addition of grisly deaths an abundance of blood and serious injury to both the criminals and to our hero this show is addictive and immensely entertaining typically like to be bit more eloquent however the most accurate word can use to describe this series is badass ', ' this is another fine addition to the marvel universe totally enjoyed it give it chance ', ' who signed off on this worst thing marvel has done by long long way 2 eps in and bored af it needs to get to the point know that was supposed to be laughing at some parts but instead was cringing avoid at all costs ', ' very entertaining first team up movie in the mcu the characters are introduced in the movie and interact well with each other the antagonist is great the jokes are funny and the cinematography dialogue cgi action and choreography are all great however it is best to watch the individual solo films before you watch this ', ' how is that this movie is so good even after masterpieces of phase three re watched it two times in row which makes it total of 6 and still loved every moment of it if have to guess it the amazing chemistry between the actors and great writing unlike awful game of thrones season 8 which makes it tick there are no grade actors in it aside perhaps robert downy jr and sam jackson yet in this one every one is star both evans and hemsworth embrace their role to perfection and aren just pretty face they are captain america and thor respectively and cant imagine anyone else in that role typical acting of mark ruffalo actually works perfectly and one might say that he did his difficult role of hulk even better than ed norton whom personally consider to be one of the best though notoriously known difficult to work with actors scarlet johanson gave superb performance and for me this is one of her best movies ever not to forget everyone else who gave an outstanding performance this movie is not without its flaws yet the sheer enjoyment and inspiration it provides makes up for it will give it 10 10 rating as this is movie that started an avengers craze for me so all the other movies even the bad ones fall into their place in this epic movie series ', ' you can see they made less effort with this one it pretty boring and slow paced too and gets tedius really fast after about 20 minutes was looking for something else to do while it played out getting really bored of assassin fighting in the street and everyone still going about their business and no police ever seem to turn up ', ' don knw why people here is saying that it does not goes to the actual story of punisher it does go to the actual story of punisher there is lot of comics on punisher on different stories this is one of them this series is fantastic and treat to watch to those viewers who love crime and action one of the best tv series on crime and action have watched ', ' well 15 min in was like hmmm this is little boring then boom the great marvelness kicked in really great film and at last we found out what happened to fury eye really enjoyed this film and would have given it 10 if it didn start off slow ', ' was starting to get into this series but of course the most fashionable form of racism rears its head anti white all we hear is past crimes of white but never others ', ' like many of the other reviews on here also thought d give it chance want to give the character chance so don want to hold this show against her didn care for the backstory but feel the character has potential this show however did not do any justice for the character the show was cheesy and barely tolerable ', ' was looking forward to this show because really like the agent coulson character in the ironman avengers movies but have been sadly disappointed have watched both episodes and ended up cringing at how ridiculous they were the stories are confusing and disjointed you can understand half of what the fitz simmons characters are saying or why some characters are even on the show feel sorry for clark gregg because feel he is an under appreciated actor with unique vibe but they have him being ridiculous straight guy in the midst of bunch of dumb antics unless you have absolutely nothing else to do don watch this crap ', ' it so happened that the avengers has quite naturally and comfortably occupied the box office throne it almost effortlessly managed to get to the very top and join the selected company of such distinguished titans as avatar titanic harry potter the lord of the rings and pirates of the caribbean in addition to the dazzling box office glory the avengers is enjoying an unprecedented public love of epic almost unhealthy flirting with obsession proportions currently the avengers confidently occupies the 39th position among the best movies of all time on imdb higher on the list than citizen kane alien american beauty vertigo the green mile once upon time in america amadeus some like it hot or gone with the wind the reviewers on netflix are ecstatic and gush with admiration this was the best super hero movie ever it had great plot and enjoyed it incredibly it has heart it has humor not dull moment the cast did an amazing job loved this movie it was fantastic this movie was amazing all of the heroes were excellent the truth is that you can scream enough praise for this movie and in the middle of all this euphoric madness in the midst of all this frenzied rage in the epicenter of all this outrageous triumph of the mediocrity produced by the never staying idle overworked hollywood assembly lines we can barely hear few sane sober voices saying in childlike amazement wait minute the emperor is naked yes despite its colorful glaring clothes mostly made of special effects the avengers is almost completely naked there is no story no good scenes or dialogs no acting because there is no substance no core no depth no intrigue no tension no mystery no heart and yes no humor what is called humor in the avengers does indeed have one positive component in it there is no bathroom jokes so common in the modern comedies no one is burping vomiting breaking winds showing naked buttocks doing any other indecencies or saying any other obscenities unfortunately the humor in the avengers has also negative side it is very primitive and quite unfunny the special effects in the avengers are impressive but chaotically purposeless and not breathtaking or intelligent or deeply symbolic as in avatar or the lord of the rings the amounts of an exciting action in the avengers are vast and the density of the movie stars would make any blockbuster jealous nevertheless those looking for anything more than liberally seasoned with primitive humor collection of sloppily connected action sequences and special effects will be utterly disappointed however judging by the box office success of the avengers nothing else is at all needed bunch of the familiar from childhood pathetic cartoonish super heroes cheerfully kicking butts of little less cartoonish but still pathetic villains and almost effortlessly but incredibly heroically saving the world in their spare time is just enough to make most movie goers extremely happy there is nothing mysterious about this after all the most popular restaurant in the world is not restaurant with the best food or the most famous and skillful chef or the nicest location or the most elegant atmosphere or the most exquisite wine list the emperor of restaurants is mcdonalds familiar from childhood good bargain with standard very basic not very healthy but at the same time very addictive menu those highly praising the story the acting and all the other non existent components of the avengers become like patron who after visiting local mcdonalds would suddenly blurt out something like what an elegant atmosphere we enjoyed when we visited mcdonalds last time the waiters were so attentive the menu was so intriguing the food was of finest quality and don forget about the location the nicest in town the hard truth is that whereas in my hypothetical example with mcdonalds everyone understands that the patron talks nonsense most of the moviegoers will not notice striking discrepancy between the cheap unimaginative fast food action they see on the screen and all the high praises that the avengers receive indeed wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning but rod is for the back of one who has no sense knowyourmovie blogspot com ', ' want to get on my knees with my big glasses and snow cap on and scream into the heavens feel like lost something that never coming back marvel derangement syndrome is real now let me begin the writers of lost star wars indiana jones and my little pony got together to make marvel movie except for one thing they didn invite the writers of the marvel cinematic universe thought was watching an episode of lost because was completely lost in this disorganized hot mess of movie ve been through what over 20 movies faithfully since the beginning and this is how m rewarded will never see another captain marvel m sorry the character is flat emotionless and just can relate mean wonder woman got it right reboot this character or phase it out she serves no purpose now this could have been great movie with the current cast but someone decided not to develop the characters and m sorry m not going to watch tv show to learn about characters in movie not gonna happen so you come in expecting to just know who some of these people are confusing as heck who green lite the crossover from tv and theater platforms lastly let take the most complex story line for an up and coming ensemble of unknown list heros and hope they have the talent and backing of the writers and director to pull it off no they didn if it wasn so ambitions and grandiose they could have pulled this off you will not get your moneys worth on this but if you are curious check it out at your own risk ', ' if somebody were to tell you that there a film featuring man in metal suit guy who wears the american flag demigod and green monster wouldn it strike you as silly oh and it gets even better there is man with an eyepatch guy with bow and arrow and flying fortress well with all that put together it still is one of the best superhero films have seen when found out that joss whedon the man who made buffy the vampire slayer was set to direct knew the film was in good hands it was unbelievable how he managed to regulate this ensemble cast felt like nobody was cut short of screen time the plot was actually pretty solid the characters had weight and the action didn sacrifice much of the plot there is one thing am very glad the film didn do put in ant man or wasp then it would have been too ridiculous ', ' thought it was bad ass and awesomely sick and kick ass absolutely loved the brutal fight scenes excellent detail character choices and music throughout the entire series couldn wait to watch the next episode to find out what happened next loved the raw toughness and courage of the punisher every punch was for his family john bernthal played the role of the punisher perfectly loved his bad ass head sways he did gestures and mannerisms suited the role to t costumes were sick loved the blood fist fight with jigsaw now that was cool especially how the punisher created jigsaw with the mirrored glass fight scene 10 10 ', ' the punisher starring jon bernthal as frank castle is tour de force in the world of superhero television series bernthal portrayal of castle is not just good it iconic he brings level of intensity depth and raw emotion to the character that makes it feel like he was born to play this role his performance is compelling blend of relentless toughness and profound vulnerability capturing the essence of frank castle tragic and vengeful crusade the show itself is masterpiece of storytelling combining hard hitting action packed narrative with deep character driven drama each episode delves into the psyche of frank castle exploring the moral complexities and emotional turmoil that drive his quest for justice the series is unflinching in its depiction of violence and its consequences making it thought provoking commentary on revenge and redemption the supporting cast is equally impressive bringing range of compelling characters to life each adding layers to the intricate story the show pacing is exceptional balancing explosive action sequences with quieter more introspective moments this pacing ensures that the series is not only thrilling but also emotionally resonant the cinematography and direction are top notch creating gritty realistic atmosphere that perfectly complements the narrative the action scenes are some of the best on television choreographed with precision and executed with an intensity that is palpable it truly unfortunate that the punisher was canceled as it had much more to offer the show cancellation was significant loss for fans of the character and the superhero genre as whole jon bernthal sensational performance combined with the show amazing story and execution cements the punisher as one of the standout series in its genre it a show that will be remembered and missed by its many fans ', ' captain marvel deserving movie after stan lee death which was still in production and as we see carla denver character interact with guess who stan lee but he was supposed to be dead as he died the previous year so basically the film had been shooting since then then came the post production phase of it though had been confused like how this character may have been the flagship character of marvel but guess not she gets exposed to radio active energised blast which gives her these massive super human abilities cause originally she had been from another planet then crash lands on earth which becomes playground for another race for their own vendettas captain marvel is fairly nice movie with it ups and downs but is genuinely original coming from the marvel comics it isn a made up character to honour stan lee or anything it originates from the comics ', ' the worst avengers movie ever saw the action is meh no deepness in the actors just plain events after 1h was wondering when it would end ', ' am so over disney marvel star wars and the rest of it this movie only strengthens that used to like black widow she was so badass this is boring beyond understanding the characters has no depth the story and dialogue are really bad the weird origin family story feels completely misplaced weisz and winstone try their best and they are really the only good things in this mess whatever they wanted to say with this they missed by mile and the not so subtle white men are idiots or evil and women are superior am so over it ', ' where do start ok superheroes saving the earth from aliens recurrent and also favorite theme for the hollywood to score big at box office this film is watchable due to cgi effects why this film is such box office hit well may be because of underlying desire of every human being to be hero in one way or the other eccentric super heroes and silly story dominates the film the story is for kids not for me as couldn connect with it in conclusion go and enjoy this film for its cgi effects and physics defying stunts ', ' oh my word thought the daredevil series was bad this snoozer is not far behind it middle aged entitled loser acting like petulant child who can get candy at the checkout at walmart it not cute and it not funny if netflix has taught me anything it that comic book characters should stay that way and whose idea was it to hire doctor who as the bad guy bloody hell netflix have more money than sense the suggestion is that the powerful womenfolk are all lesbians let see some lesbo action eh mean throw us guys bone here mean get it she a role model for women she a pessimistic needy slut with drink issues what woman can relate to that but for guys she a pessimistic needy slut with drink issues not something men find attractive and because all the other women are lesbians there really nothing to keep guys tuned in now that we are painfully aware that they aren gonna get it on for the cameras gave this dreck 3 stars because of the interesting door which is thankfully featured as the comic relief but by episode 5 even that gets killed off ', ' to be honest ve watched only the first two episodes but think that enough to say this to you marvel the punisher is not what you expect there no superpowers at least for now hope it keeps that way no non sense action no daredevil no defenders hope that is enough to warn you about this series this is action drama series realistic and very violent from what ve seen and to me is along with daredevil the best of marvel on netflix ve warned you if you want to see something related with superheroes or guys fighting to save the city clich go watch defenders or some other marvel shows this is mostly about conspiration and revenge ', ' really had high hope for this but disappointed the story don offer much loved it in comics but this series disappointed me alot did not expected this marvel thing ', ' alright let go straight to the point this is one of the worst marvel movies with terrible script with everything being resolved very quickly liked yelena lot but the other characters are very silly and not at all charismatic besides the villain who is serious rival to mandarin in iron man 3 as marvel worst villain in short it a movie far below the standard marvel quality real disappointment and please disney stop being deadbeat and pay scarlet ', ' worst actor worst story worst cgi is ever saw in series worst everything stop defending bad shows marvel stop making shows like this and remove bad reviews becaue of the woke culture thanks ', ' m not the biggest fan of the setup movies for the avengers think they re tremendously hit and miss and not through some comic book fan need for accuracy but as stand alone films on their own merits see like the odd comic book but m certainly not comic book fan what am fan of is good solid storytelling you know characters that evolve logically sound motivations and tensions good pacing an antagonist defeated through skill rather than luck that sort of thing from this perspective the setup movies fell mostly flat for me iron man was fabulous fun but it sequel was poor the hulk was meh captain america spent far too long without any actual captain america in it and thor hmmm was just bit of an all round mess and lacked even eye candy set pieces to elevate it so back few years ago when it first became whispered in nerd circles that the avengers was going to surface to tie all these movies together didn really get much of sense of excitement few years later as the end credits rolled on thor pretty much made up my mind that the avengers movie was going to screw up badly if the industry couldn pull off good movie with just one hero in it how could they ever pull off one with six then heard that joss whedon was writing and directing and my interest rekindled after all ve seen him handle symphonies of characters before with the scooby gang and the serenity crew if anyone could do it whedon could but still was wary just didn want to let my expectations get too high superhero movies are notoriously difficult to get right after all maybe even whedon would screw it up boy was wrong don think ve had this much fun at the cinema in years since the first matrix movie in fact which was what twelve years ago god m old the avengers had everything good popcorn flick needs major action setpieces beautiful sfx some neat and effective humor yada yada yada but none of that is what left my jaw on the floor what really blew me away and what compelled me to come here and write the first review ve done on imdb in quite some time years probably was just how perfectly done the script was every character is given their moment to shine every interaction is perfectly in tune this whole movie was the audiovisual equivalent of listening to perfectly wrought symphony every moving part clicked into place so well that you couldn have taken out one single character not even the arguably second tier characters of hawkeye and the black widow without the whole thing coming apart this is no batman or pirates of the caribbean or spider man movie because while those multi protagonist movies were all quite adequate and entertaining the characters and plots were often an out of focus mess not so in the avengers everything clicks so perfectly can even find the words to describe it you ll just have to go see it for yourself to see what mean ', ' like said great show fun for the whole family with especially great acting and camera work m one episode in and still skeptical about some changes from comics to screen including the core nature of her powers but it enough for me to be hooked ', ' am not loyal mcu watcher watched many of the mcu movies and also some episodes of series from the mcu so maybe my lack of understanding is partly due to this but disregsrding the mcu continuity understanding of the movie parts of it were just too lazy written the jokes were mostly lame laughed once and that was because thought of how ridiculously this was written don expect blockbuster to make scientific sense but little bit more effort in made up stuff helps the viewer to believe the story their in from the story standpoint this movie is certain 0 out of 10 the acting of some of the lead cast and supporting roles was quite impressing which is probably the only good thing about the movie besides some ideas as well cgi of characters was pretty bad reminded me of 90s cgi if you are mcu fan watch it everyone else expect nothing good and you might have few good minutes ', ' really loved it the characters were amazing and so was the plot really added another layer to nats character ', ' season 1 season 1 was fun take of punisher not the punisher m use to but he was really good overall the show was good could have been better in area like providing more punisher like portrayal from the comics season 2 was massive step up punisher actually gets to punish in the style that drew me towards punisher the story is very intriguing its more of punisher and billy show jigsaw is nothing like the comics or like the movie he is guy with memory loss truama and he basically wanders around trying to figure things out his face only has scratch on it and he is not intimidating to look at if anything he is much better wearing mask punisher actor does very well in his role if you like blood cat and mouse gore guns killing and anti hero who doesn give damn punisher season 2 is the show for you to answer the question justice nice and revenge is sweet ', ' such stupid show we could expect from cw not marvel wow just wow how can this be sooo bad it looks so strange and unnecesary for who is this 3 year olds ', ' was in love with the idea however somewhat disappointing that was gonna have to see another unoriginal superhero series hopefully when people see how this was butchered they might call for original ideas and some actually new content simply cannot get past the terrible acting in this series elden henson foggy nelson himself takes six points away from the possible ten could have given this series if it were cast correctly netflix has already set the standard of its shows with house of cards in which the casting was done perfectly all actors perform well and fit their roles how they could flip flop like this disappoints me this could have truly been great series now non salvageable ', ' wanted to love this as much as wanted to love its predecessor because captain marvel is one of my favorite comic superheroes however just didn it doesn feel like the producers of the captain marvel franchise love the character or understand her because they don put any heart into her in fact it seems like more personality and intrigue was put into her flerken companion than it was carol monica or kamala for that matter the movie had very girl power under one to it but not in way that makes me as woman feel seen or represented it almost felt like parody of that idea ', ' saw the first episode this show is stupid guess marvel is trying to target little kids on this one but jeez it cheesy annoying and stupid hope this is just an outlier and not the beginning of the end for marvels it seems like all of their other recent mcu series have been really good and then this crap will pretend this series never happened it was just nightmare and not real it didn happen ', ' everyone these days is looking for soul crushing sequels that stand up to infinity war and endgame but don realize those were made to end an era this movie has laughs fun action and family thoroughly enjoyed the film could it have gone without the singing planet yes but the heart was there and the marvels made great team bringing kamala in to bring some lightheartedness to captain marvels arc was great choice and iman knocks this character out of the park all the ladies did great job and fury was on point as always looking forward to see how they tie the post credit scene into the future of the universe ', ' it is too early to say if the show is going to be good to bad currently it is going with the slow feel good vibe people with south asian backgrounds would have more to relate and there are some fun references as well to enjoy for example craze for shahrukh khan don usually write reviews but since this one is getting smacked pretty harshly had to do it people can learn enjoy something new or unique for this series e say mashallah when find someone attractive but it true this show is not for everyone ', ' it seems like besides nolan batman and the punisher am doomed to never appreciate the dull action super hero films that seem to sweep the film world and produce millions of misguided teen action junkies this would be gem for cinema experience of huge 200 inch tv but there is reason these films never gain academy awards genuine ground breaking respect aside from budget and ratings the point of this review is just an opinionated rant to quarrel with the repetitive plots and average performances that people seem to just eat up and refuse to expand fantastic cinema experience because they re long and to them boring can state what boring hero is at the height of their average power suddenly they encounter an ability or change that makes them more powerful and nearly worshiped iron man thor cpt america batman spiderman now girl or love interest that comes along and makes them vulnerable or around the time where they become vulnerable because typically these films have to take their powers away iron man thor the hulk batman spiderman wolverine and superman now they are usually hated at this point because they can protect the masses or their loved ones or are just in doubt if they should pick up their dusty war torn mantle iron man batman hulk and wolverine and the bad guy is defeated the girl is usually saved except poor old batman wolverine iron man spiderman the hulk do you see where am leading too do people like watching the same stuff just wearing different cape metaphore for the smarties out there am fan of kurbick tarentino del toro whoops am hellboy fan scorsese finch mendes aronofsky eastwood and anderson fan among others and know the guidelines between film for fun and film for what is described as moving art or groundbreaking visual emotion and plot oh for suggestion for some pretty slick action films that have earned respect try leon the professional heat bunraku and kiss kiss bang bang black comedy as well ', ' just finished watching first two seasons am happy that had not read any reviews or heard any comments prior to that making the experience ecstatic great job overall but the portrayal of daredevil by charlie cox and kingpin wilson fisk by vincent onofrio was just marvellous can wait for the next season ', ' m not even marvel fan but this show changed that completely love the fact that she is pakistani muslim girl with her everyday normal struggles m looking forward to the whole season marvel did great job on this one ', ' m not marvel fan and have seen maybe six marvel movies in total mostly the first ones with iron man and thor heard this movie was fun so me and my wife watched it together felt like would have needed to see the previous movies because struggled to follow along the characters aren introduced you are assumed to know who everyone is there are references to things that has happened assume in previous movies it felt like coming into tv series mid season without anyone to explain it all felt excluded and like this movie was made primarily for people who already love marvel movies and have watched all of them it was fun comedy but didn really get the story or motivations for anything going on the cat was cute wish more superheros had pets that why really liked guardians of the galaxy love the racoon even though he technically not pet still cute heard this was really expensive movie but the alien people look like they re from an episode of old star trek with silly ears and green or blue skin which would be fine if the movie had the budget and charm of old star trek but an expensive movie should look more realistic in my opinion and again who are all these alien people no clue we don get any context unless you are already die hard fan or studied wikipedia before trying to enjoy this movie you shouldn have to study to enjoy movie could enjoy lord of the rings without reading the books first the lack of context made it hard to feel engaged this is why don see these superhero movies and maybe you ll love it if you are already religiously dedicated fan but otherwise would say you should watch something else also found the portrayal of the indian family bit offensive just because it a comedy everyone doesn have to be silly and stupid let also talk about the tonality because it is comedy it feels like the serious scenes are bit too abrupt to let your emotions adapt it probably really hard to walk that line well but good comedies have to have some sort of serious aspect to them even the lego movies have this and the musical part feels really out of place like silly episode from buffy or some other tv series maybe because marvel is disney now they had to add it or is this kids movie and missed that the old marvel movies were for adults so thought this one was too m glad we saw it on disney or would have felt cheated on my money ', ' yes its superhero super cast marathon insane cgi and production values at its best blah blah blah everyone knows that what people don know is why avengers will work for most and not for few believe the real heroes of this movie are two guys joss wheton director writer screenplay writer seamus mcgarvey cinematographer have observed the movies which really work as an integrated unit are the ones where the director himself does the screenplay as film student myself can safely say that no matter how hard you try if the director and screenplay writers have two different work spaces unless they are people who get along on very personal level they would never get it rolling on film that why people like christopher nolan peter jackson take their movies into outer space ok enough crap what bad the fact that its another superhero bang bang movie with the typical marvel unrealistic non human plots the story moves in predictable direction and the thrills were expected only well presented the fact that there currently no spiderman xmen in marvel avengers scheme of things will disappoint few fans although marvel studios are onto sony columbia and fox to get individual character rights for sequels so surely group of people will find it ordinary or not worth their time what good you will run out of answers when you think of could this movie with this plot have been made any better at all all the fan favorite marvel characters in the film are given as much character development and depth as 142 min film could ve allowed while at the same time make sure the visuals make it into the trailers and get audiences rolling in the cinematography is fantastic for example there couple of scenes where we camera are in the car and we see ourselves rolling and the action scenes are done so that you can register admire them properly michael bay should have look into this joss wheton is top class all through classic big screen adventure for the majority of the fans you will clap cheer hoot at robert downey jr quirks dr banner hulk smash comedy and will admire chris evans commands as captain america jeremy renner as hawkeye and chris hemsworth as thor the visuals are fantastic the plot is entertaining all through 3d is an added feature which personally enjoyed tremendously if you have group of friends to go with this movie will surely make your weekend ', ' its the 3rd season now honestly think the tv series should just called it daisy and the rest of h e d agents leftover beside almost everything are centered around her the series started with her and most probably ends with her too at least on 3rd season or any continuous season they should focus on different individual but instead like force awaken its been spoiled by an over powerful one dimensional character am disappointed with the series as was hoping it would finally made changes and focus on introducing more meaningful characters with good background story line it seems like either the new character wrap around her like over dramatise juvenile or merely cameos if not end up dead in few series after that ', ' started out as fan of aos in 2014 just barely understanding all of the foreign knowledge was learning from my high school education learned more about space and how to live in spaceship than did in any other show watched enough of this show to then realize am actually somewhat qualified to be shield agent on my good days the drama and graphics and teamworkmanship kept me interested to care to watch every season watched this show lot during quarantine it helped me learn lot didn know about learning both the villains struggle and the hero struggle all in one show was pretty mind blowing but overall think this show is classic and would recommend it to any marvel fan ', ' far too many plot holes in this marvel caper than all marvel avenger franchise movies combined black widow falls several stories of building but she gets up like superman without scratch while her compatriots break bones and bleed the fact that none of the lead female characters do their own stunts so it does look incredibly fake no michelle rodriguez fast and the furious style fighting here just plain fake unrealistic action superhero movie far from it ', ' the opening scene was incredible the rest of the film was just marvel movie ', ' the film is even weaker than marvel mediocre films and the story is highly clich and has no complexity scarlett johansson was not at all up to her previous roles the rest of the actors were not great either the only actress who can give an acceptable score is florence pugh the movie had good action and another of the positive points of the movie is that it has timely humor and laughter florence pugh the synopsis of the film did not deserve all this expectation at all they just wanted to ruin the good death of natasha romanov ', ' this was just knock off bourne or james bond movie with the black widow and her family of spies as the stars the action scenes in the dark rooms were really bad because all the characters are dressed in similar black uniforms so had no idea who was doing what most of the time guess this was all cgi it was impossible to follow black widow is not very interesting and most of the best lines come from her sister florence pugh and her father the red guardian david harbour the comic book version of red guardian was totally tough super soldier but in the movie he is just fat has been like thor in the last avengers endgame movie harbour is mostly around for comedy but he is good actor and makes his role interesting rachel weisz plays the black widow mother and it is pretty generic performance the story is really odd as weisz is the brains of the russian spy system but she is on farm doing brain control experiments on pigs the main russian spy master was very generic russian character talking about world domination and power he could have been from spectre the guy reminded me of blofeld and several other spectre leaders from past james bond movies taskmaster was very unique and interesting character in the comic books and he is totally destroyed as character in this movie his entire back story character and everything about taskmaster is changed and not for the better this movie takes place after captain america civil war and before the avengers versus thanos movies it seems like this movie should have been done and released about five years ago and it is out of place in the current marvel timeline ', ' guess really didn get it why did she get and or need her own movie it really didn do anything for the mcu in my opinion go in with low expectations and you may enjoy it ', ' have only been through episode 1 and the character is childish selfish very artificial and fragile please do yourself favour and don even watch this for cash reward of million dollars you will be terrified and disappointed which will permanently scar your marvel universe experience you won be able to appreciate or enjoy any other characters if you watch this ', ' the actress seriously lacks sills basically she giggles at every happy scene and sheds two ounces of crocodile tears at every sad scene the story revolves around some self made up nonsense don watch this ', ' this movie has an amazing performance by the cast great action and fantastic dynamic ', ' so the best female superhero movie yet yes but that isn a high bar the first wonder woman was the only ok one so far and even that had terrible second half black widow is competent action film with decent plot some fun characters ok jokes and very well done action sequences it isn on par with the best in the mcu the main problem is that black widows back story is given too little focus and that makes the villain forgettable and makes the whole affair bit shallow think the director wanted to avoid it being too dark knowing where it ends but that was mistake as it stands the jokes come across as bit odd because we understand the underlying darkness but we haven explored it if we were given the full story believe the humor would have been the gallows humor that feels appropriate for people who have been so abused that could have been one of the best mcu movies ever ', ' reminds me that fith element scene where korban asks leeloo for sorter name that just makes me laugh so hard all russians here are so evil that they talk with each other using fullnames if you don get it saying alexei in russian every time is like saying timothy or robert instead of tim and bob which makes it terribly official non family close relative kinda style common guys you should have talked with russian speaking consultant right regarding the movie nah basic nothing new ', ' m fan of marvel and herd good things about this movie but by watching this and looking over the reviews it actually is mad true this movie was not good nor awful but boring at many at many parts of the movie the plot of the story was hard to understand of whats going on really don get it way this movie has high rating mean 8 4 thats just rotten its should be around 4 5 around there this movie is sooooooo boring that the action was so cheap and yea the acting was not bad but what killed it was hardly action and superheros as well as the plot this to me is like transformers at the end when they fight the wired vilans or evil robots and robot fish lol what joke this is so mad boring no offense but this movie is horrible its soo blahhh just rent it and don buy unless are har core marvel fan would have give rating of 1 or 2 but the acting was the only good thing about this movie ', ' my biggest regret with this movie is not seeing it in the theater in my mind scarlett johansson had every right to sue disney over the streaming rights of this movie the sound and special effects in this movie clearly separate it from the previous movies of marvel past this movie dives deep into the backstory of black widow something we only learned bits and pieces of during the progression of the marvel story line this movie takes place after civil war and answers lot of questions between then and infinity war the movie is action packed with some amazing fight scenes as well as heart felt actor david harbour makes his marvel screen debut in this movie and his personality is seen very similar to that of what we see on stranger things he is the comedic relief in more serious action movie this movie themes around family what it truly means to have one an amazing film that is must see for any marvel fans out there of course your not true marvel fan if you don stick around till the end of the credits ', ' m sorry but guess m just not woke enough for this disney is trying so hard to remind us that white straight males are just not thing anymore and that everybody who is different should be put in the spotlight its so forced and also its typical american show were the drama is really over the top guess this show is only for woke teens and not for me ', ' honestly felt insulted for taking my time to watch this show the story is too focused on culture instead of adventure understand the need to introduce diversity into the entertainment industry but can we just focus on the entertainment part ', ' worst marvel movie so far characters are shallow obvious plot too much cgi ', ' watched ms marvel with iman velani as kamala khan ms marvel matt lintz the walking dead as bruno carrelli yasmeen fletcher let us in as nakia bahadir zenobia shroff the big sick as muneeba khan mohan kapur hostages as yusuf khan saagar shaikh game of thrones as aamir khan aramis knight stingers as kareem red dagger nimra bucha remy as najma mehwish hayat usuni as aisha anjali bhimani overwatch as auntie ruby rish shah emmerdale farm as kamran and oscar winning actress brie larson just mercy as carol danvers captain marvel enjoyed kamala arc while tweaking her origin slightly but keeping her essence intact yes it was nice to know she wasnt deterred or hampered by the snap blip and love her powers come from the bangle which are nega bands from the comics also she is fan of carol danvers captain marvel happy the mcu first female superhero inspired her also loved it included the partition shame how had to learn about from tv show byproduct of colonialism but im glad the show showed the wonderful pakinstani muslim culture please they are peaceful yes while do love the character of kamala khan ms marvel moon knight is still best marvel show of this year score by laura karpman lovecraft country cinematography by robrecht heyvaert bad boys for life producing from kevin feige doctor strange in the multiverse of madness and show running adil billal gangsta fantastic character study of kamala kha aka ms marvel and great lead in to the marvels 8 10 ', ' first of all as person who is from asian continent and indian the character of kamala khan is so exeggrative that it not even feel like asian nia who is the director doesn even read comics is directing this film it ruining the legacy that was built the hard work that was done by the actors writers directors this movie with goofy dialouges editing woes one of the glaring issues with the marvels is its lackluster editing scenes feel disjointed and transitions are often jarring leaving the audience struggling to follow the narrative the pacing is inconsistent robbing the film of the seamless flow that is crucial for an engaging superhero movie goofy dialogues the dialogue in the marvels is another major letdown instead of the sharp witty exchanges we ve come to expect from marvel films the lines often come across as forced and cringe worthy the humor feels forced and the attempts at banter fall flat it as if the writers were trying too hard to replicate the success of previous marvel movies resulting in script that lacks the authenticity and charm we ve grown accustomed to character development beyond the technical aspects the marvels also disappoints in terms of character development the lack of depth in character arcs leaves the audience emotionally disconnected from the protagonists while marvel films have excelled in crafting compelling characters with relatable struggles this installment seems to prioritize spectacle over substance ', ' it felt like spiderman series or films from another universe it is worthless attempt from marvel and it does not support heroism power and charisma hate it and all my expectations from marvel is going down big time ', ' came into the movie with very low expectations expectations were quickly exceeded captain marvel wandavision and ms marvel were average that had their good moments this movie was better than those shows plot was decent nothing revealing about the future movies in particular kang the conquer had some good action sequences and unexpected humor with the cats think brie larsen redeemed herself as an actress slightly with this movie slight spoiler here stay for the mid credit scene it will be interesting to see how men and marvel collaborate together it seems this is the direction we re heading with deadpool 3 involving hugh jackman it was everything expected from marvel movie ', ' this is movie that changed what generation expected to get out of movies actually thought the premise of combining bunch of heroes into one film was the dumbest thing had ever heard had really enjoyed iron man 2008 and captain america 2011 but hadn enjoyed thor 2011 hadn even seen incredible hulk 2008 because of how bad heard it was and didn really like iron man 2 2010 but someone talked me into seeing this movie and paid for my ticket and politely agreed ll never forget being overwhelmed by the sense of how epic this movie was the lines are unforgettable especially by nick fury samuel jackson and the two distinct climactic battles are both completely satisfying now want movies to make me feel the way this movie made me feel it is largely for my entire generation the definitive cinematic experience the other thing that stands is my college professors complaining in the most cliche way possible that it didn say anything about the human experience man those guys were overpaid all they had to do was pay attention to how the audience reacted and they would have learned lot about the human experience on point taken off for the tony not really dead scene because holy hollywood cliche batman ', ' the hate for this has definitely been excessive and seems to have little to do with the quality of the movie the movie was okay but forgettable there wasn anything terrible enough to warrant the hate for it assume it just general disney backlash combined with the main characters all being female and that a tough one for redpills to swallow think for normal people though there nothing objectionable here fairly typical marvel affair at this point unexceptional in every way if you re still fan of the mcu this movie won impress you at all but you certainly won hate it ', ' we have probably been spoiled with mcu series that have lot of action in them this show is more disney than mcu and the target audience seems to be tween and below it a fun little show and loved all the pakistani references ', ' went into this movie with an assumption figured that the action scenes would be awesome marvel had shown that they were very capable of great action sequences and this would be no exception however action alone doesn make good movie matrix sequels this was the part that was worried about would the story and characters be good enough to match the explosive action the answer is resounding yes great character interactions hilarious dialog true comic book story not deep like dark knight but fun like iron man all of the characters have roles that feel natural and the dialog flows robert downey jr getting joss whedon lines is as good as it sounds and never realized how hilariously awesome the hulk could be there are few problems had with the movie such as captain america back story no wait really just hated the captain america movie this movie met my expectations which were enormously high so to surpass them this would have had to be the second coming of christ type of awesome ', ' went into this show already nervous from the trailers the show never looked very cohesive and had no real drive that encouraged watchers there are only so many origin stories an audience can stomach without real stakes and ms marvel can be seen as the obvious catalyst the stylistic design and acting were both great but the plot and reasons behind plot are ultimately more important ms marvel fails to deliver on good writing and asks for the audience to immediately become engaged and empathize in day to day struggles with character we know nothing about the sloppy atmosphere and embarrassing portrayal of teenage life is horribly outdated and only represents view taken by outsiders to teenage life this show fell into every cliche right off episode one and fails to deliver any independent storytelling that sets it aside as must see marvel show just warning if you watch you will leave having felt you wasted your time ', ' scarlett johansson returns one last time as natasha romanoff in her final adventure as the deadliest member of the avengers black widow delivers all of the action and traditional mcu formula we have come to expect and enjoy at this point in time though the movie occasionally is bogged down by lazy dialogue and plot that feels rushed and uninspired ', ' the mcu has introduced planet eaters infinity stones all sort of god like creatures but for some reason they think that well over decade of such movies they can excite me with the story of 5 4 russian girl who is really athletic and has ninja spy training seriously now this movie is boring and underwhelming even compared to any mcu tv series episode mean those have been lot more grand in terms of their plot than this nonsense the black widow origin story should have been among the first earliest mcu movies to be made not the most recent ones it made no sense for it to come out now ', ' not appealing to certain audiences very cheesy but can see how it works for younger audience not the worst thing ve seen but definitely not great dosent deserve the 1s it has been getting though along with the 10 10s ', ' after few days had to think to remember this movie not good sign the start was very good the rest meh story was not surprising and to much of the same ', ' after being delayed for what seemed like years and lawsuits over actor pay finally decided to watch this did not expect much and m glad because this movie is not good sure it has some moments but overall it kinda boring as the story is not really interesting the visuals also look pretty bad for mcu entry maybe if it was tv show or made exclusively for disney plus it could get away with the visuals but this was in theaters would be pissed if paid to see it it pretty forgettable as well it can also be used for evidence in the argument that there is way too many super hero movies currently in hollywood has mcu peaked and now flooding the market with over saturated recycled super hero garbage at this point think spider man is our only real last hope to prove that wrong ', ' why are they bringing these amateur heros are all these kids messed up in head such childish behavior and no talent at all why did they even make it just in the name of inclusion if you can include just don forcefully trying and failing that is all see ', ' since the dawn of men we aspired to be heroes we told each other stories of strong and smart men who fought in legendary battles stood against fearsome beasts and saved beautiful damsels in distress since the 20s of the last century some people have been writing such stories down in the form of comic books and graphic novels two of the people who did this were stan lee and jack kirby at marvel comics the created among others the rich genius in flying suit called iron man the super soldier called captain america new version of thunder god thor two spies under the names black widow and hawkeye and of course the man that turns into big green angry monster which calls itself hulk comics like this were made into movies but nearly all of them had some flaws they weren like the comics took themselves to serious made to much jokes or had some other flaws now pretty unknown director takes few famous heroes of marvel see above and makes movie with them with does no mistakes the other movies made the story itself is about heroes with flaws who need to grow together as team so they can save the world from mighty attack from other world if you like stories of heroes and strange folks you should go see this movie it not perfect but very close being perfect ', ' season one was ok but season two is the same storyline became boring very fast into the second season ', ' looks like marvel just wanted movie for black widow and didn want it to be super cool it feels like they didn even try they just made it generic spy flick wonder woman 1986 had lot of flaws but they tried they had new ideas their humor was better russian accents cannot carry the whole movie funny fat dad cannot make weak plot line strong there was no sense of proper villain the movie was all over the place ', ' daredevil the movie was quite disappointing and to be honest that what expected from this netflix series as well ve never been happier to be proved wrong charlie cox apart from being incredibly droolie and having smile that makes you smile give me moment here is pretty decent actor vincent onofrio makes you sympathize and hate him all at the same time elden henson plays very adorkable foggy the show is quite dark compared to the regular marvel cinematic universe which is what makes it even more appealing cause we all know life isn a fairytale with or without superhero the show brings out many emotions in you there were times when was literally scared for murdock daredevil life as he is portrayed as someone who isn completely invincible as he is beaten up and thrown around by the baddies quite bit there were times when was exceedingly frustrated with the power that money has over people there were times when feared for the life of characters and mourned their death and there were times when cheered when people got what they deserved isn that how good series should make you feel the only minuscule flaw in my opinion was daredevil outfit in my opinion it could have been better but hey m not complaining watched the 1st and 2nd episode and was hooked and binged the entire season in span of two days would have been day if didn have to work have nothing but positive reviews for this show hope and pray that season 2 which comes out in 2016 is just as good or better than the season 1 cant wait ', ' this film is the equivalent of unbuttered toast or glass of flat coke it doesn do anything risky and it made my eyes glaze over in the middle there nothing inherently wrong about it and from technical standpoint it fine but it hits all the notes that paint by numbers superhero movie would hit on the plus side it fills in few mcu mythos gaps some cgi was impressive and probably will make for neat little setup for endgame finally friend of mine who thought that the last jedi was the greatest of all the live action star wars movies loved this move so guess make of that as you will ', ' this is best dark piece of tv ve seen in quite while to keep it short imagine chris nolan developed marvel flick for television and drew goddard adorned it with his sweet and nasty nerdism you ll get perfect character development this goes for the vigilante charlie cox is brilliant as daredevil as well as the blind lawyer as well as for his opponent onofrio is outstanding and maybe one of the most well conceived comic villains ever and thrilling superhero origin story daredevil would ve made the best marvel movie so far if this was thought for the big screen ', ' why bother naming show after an established character then completely ignore all canon of the character would give it 6 as kids show if they created new character in name as well as powers abilities and story this story has nothing to do with ms marvel except her name if you are literally changing everything else and creating completely new character then create new name for her as well ', ' instead of the usual marvel phases there should be subset of the tween teen targeted marcel shows films with ms marvel spider man hawkeye and maybe more these do seem to target younger generations with the cringy awkward teenager experiences in terms of defining their identities plus know being super heroes crushes claiming independence from family cultures desires to keep them safe children doing well in school etc as somebody in their early 40s think that marvel gets the age targeting correct hawkeye was pretty boring and dragged out but ms marcel and spider man have all the confusion humor and celebrations that seem apt for teenage superheroes my family thought ms marvel was great and adding on the character history just added more depth the dialogue and differing perspectives across four generations was compelling and refreshing as somebody from mixed east asian and white background didn know about lot of the pakistani history and thought it was really educational and humanizing the art in the show was stunning and it was fun taking the trip to kashmir the young actresses and actors were well chosen for their roles and their evolution and gradual maturity well to degree was really well done the length of the mini series seemed perfect compared to hawkeye which dragged on too long and had very little depth entertainment in comparison the character lacking the most dimension was the woman in charge of the damage control group she seemed too flat and stereotyped which made her less appealing giving her more depth probably would have made the show stronger definitely show worth watching to the end just to see how the family and characters change over short 6 episodes would love more like this and spider man for sure ', ' this movie was really good funny entertaining as good as any other marvel movie excluding avengers think all these negative reviews are people jumping on the hater bandwagon dont let them put you off go see this with an open mind and promise you will be entertained 8 10 ', ' loved taskmaster from comics but they really screwed him in the movie taskmaster can actually face whole avengers at time and in movie he is just not great watch it for pugh ', ' there comes time every once in while when movie is released to the public that changes everything star wars changed sci fi films forever the lord of the rings trilogy re defined fantasy and made it respectable genre and now we have joss whedon avengers which can say with assurance that is nothing short of the most entertaining comic book movie ever made and all can say to my fellow comic book fanboys and girls is this this is the best time to be comic book geek in history let me make it clear that this is spoiler free review so do not worry about reading further on in case you have not watched the film yet avengers represents the culmination of more than 4 years worth of work and setting up since the release of the first iron man movie back in 2008 and boy does it deliver whedon and co knocked it out of the park without giving too much away the story consists of loki the demigod we saw in last year thor with tom hiddleston reprising the role who has somehow attained an alien army under his command and plans to use it to invade earth obviously h e d and agent nick fury played by the always awesome samuel jackson don like that so they now must resort to assembling the greatest team to fight this army the world had ever seen and among these individuals are iron man aka tony stark played by the ever entertaining robert downey jr the wwii era super soldier captain america aka steve rogers played by chris evans the god of thunder thor played by chris hemsworth and of course everyone favorite brute the hulk aka bruce banner when not the green raging monster played by mark ruffalo who initially had doubts about his abilities to play good bruce banner but assure you and this is coming from comic book geek point of view he does not disappoint the question is though will this team of superheroes get along well with each other what loved the most about this movie is how whedon so masterfully gives each character enough screen time to make them feel essential to the plot and all of them serve an important role one way or another and they all get their own moment to shine even those who doubted that the normal h e d agents hawkeye and black widow played by jeremy renner and the oh so attractive scarlett johansson respectively would stand out among the roster of super enhanced heroes would be proved wrong nobody is left out and everybody gives an awesome performance worthy of the characters they re playing the screenplay itself also consisted of witty one liners and is full of hilarious moments could even go on as far as saying that this movie gave me more laughs than any comedy ve seen in years the humor has perfect timing all around and it used at just the right level to not make the film feel silly the drama is still there but the comedy adds nice change of pace for when things might start feeling maybe too dramatic for some the action scenes of course are some of the best ve seen in years the special effects department has really outdone itself in this movie giving us some amazing and thrilling sequences filled with punches explosions arrows bullets laser beams missiles rubble you name it it essentially everything but the kitchen sink just the last 30 minutes alone of this film would be worth paying the admittedly hefty 18 imax 3d cost which is the venue that had the joy of experiencing the film in which brings me to my next point the 3d now know many people are not fans of 3d and it understandable the movie itself was not shot with 3d cameras such as how avatar but nevertheless never felt bothered by it during the whole film despite it being post shooting conversion although guess you won still miss much of you see it in 2d either way you ll enjoy any of the 2 formats there is also special surprise for the audience about quarter into the end credits which hints at what possible developments will take place for the next marvel movies following avengers and there is also another scene at the very end of the credits which also recommend that you stay tuned to watch without giving too much away it is perhaps the most hilarious image of the whole film all in all marvel the avengers is one incredibly entertaining experience which everyone should watch in theaters do not be cheap and decide to watch it in your computer screen watch this movie in cinema as it is easily the best way to enjoy this wild ride of film assure you this is the movie that fans of comic books all around have been waiting their whole lives for the 4 years of hyping up this film have easily paid off and now can wait to see what the next chapter of the marvel movieverse will take us ', ' the punisher hits almost everything right it gives it audience what they want maybe even more the fight scenes are captivating the acting is phenomenal and the show grabs your attention in such way that you could finish it in day the build up is well done but the first episode falls below the others regarding their ability to hook the audince hence give it 9 stars instead of 10 ', ' very bad show very confusing even if read the comic bad effects bad acting bad all together please invest in something better not even sure where this show is going not sure what they were trying to accomplish here ', ' captain marvel was cool think most of all fans expect large expensive avengers movie dude it was only the first movie from denvers and it was cool love the stan lee intro and the cat the real hero ', ' spent the worst twelve bucks of my entire life buying the ticket to watch this movie had to get out of the theater because couldn handle such amount of trash sorry for the marvel lovers but this movie sucks from beginning to end bought the ticket taking as reference the 8 7 average the imdb meter published completely disappointing from now on ll take more care when trusting that meter or actually is not imdb problem but it the perfect example of how humans can be dumb enough to love such an insult to the story telling job or is movie made just for the marvel geeks but really think its just business for those who seek profound stories this is not the one at all you ll regret for sure if you watch the movie considerable huge amount of the film is war explosions sound effects in not complete enemy of cinema effects when they are used for good like avatar but this time is empty from bottom to top guess it just the way of making business and earn lot of money it ironic after watching the movie part of it started to believe that humans were made to be ruled and submitted even when we deny it and loving this movie is the example ', ' actor john cusack once said that there are no more big production studios anymore there are just bunch of banks which provide funding credits for projects and approve which script would be produced according to box office profit it is projected to generate because hollywood mentality became like more money bigger stars bigger budget bigger marketing bigger blockbuster bigger box office income that all it matters since comicbook superhero genre is the newest and biggest market to be milked in popular culture for hollywood in these harsh economy is it surprising that the avengers childish intake about bunch of ridiculously costumed superheroes with one dimensional immature behavior getting together to repel an alien invasion again think any actual alien seeing these alien invasion movies would not even close earth ever again our always winning despite odds thing would be silly to them unfortunetely not this is another shallow seasonal product another leave your brain at theater door movie aimed for comic con convention fans and admit it is big market just like most movies in this genre there are few exceptions it has its own clich and tropes like they are coming out of factory assembly line at least director joss whedon great tv writer producer was follower of firefly and dollhouse does not deny them and recognizing what they are wears them at movie sleeve bickering superheroes that fine amusing with whedonesque humor but humor got overwhelming and made superheroes childlike not multi dimensional characters

american urban area this year it is new york city trashing time good vs evil government made the mistake of launching nuclear missile it is averted heroes are victorious blah blah it is the end after all this sequence of predictable events where no protagonist was harmed and good guys win what do we have an empty blockbuster which will make big box office hit probably franchise but at the end an empty film can not wait in 20 30 years our grandchildren asking is this the stuff your generation was watching no wonder everything really mattered like environment economy politics or simple psyche

which later leads to confusion brawl and fights on the inside all is taken lightly until the realization and attack on the base which proves that the whole world is at stake the screenplay as well as the storyline is amazing every scene handled with perfection the story is well explained and gives break from the action which keeps you in the movie the cinematography is awesome and exceptional with the direction and special effects justifies the storyboard and is realistic all the action sequences are well coordinated engaging and with popping 3d effects well in place it a treat to the eye the screen space is shared equally and handled well between the large cast about the soundtrack it average nothing extraordinary or provoking the movie just misses out somewhere on the emotions the previous releases have already made the superheroes familiar and this avoids much confusion well edited and brilliantly adapted screenplay makes the most of the storyline and even handles the major challenge that could have been faced of making order of chaos the much hyped movie has definitely met the expectations and is perfect blockbuster even watch it from some fresh action from hulk black widow and the hawkeye who don disappoint you at all mark raffalo performance and character is noticeable out of all the other star superheroes no doubt the best superhero movie this decade 3 time watch for comic superhero movie fans 2 time for super action fans and at least onetime must watch for every other hollywood movie buff out there ', ' deffo will keep watching for the cool and kickass ms marvel watched it with the whole family and we all loved it always loved marvel when its at the beginning stage and discovering new powers ', ' guess m the odd man out but for me this show just isn fun started reading daredevil when was kid in the eighties was few years too late for the frank miller stuff on the racks but bought it all up in reprints even liked the old bill everett and wally wood stuff didn have high expectation for the show or anything ll watch any comicbooky show like the arrow flash and gotham and all that stuff they could all be little better the flash is the best of the bunch but take them for what they are however this show is just boring and it doesn really resemble the comic think of it either as crime show that been dumbed down with comic book elements or comic book show that been muted by lame csi type network tv tropes m surprised so many people like it it seems like the kind of compromised show that comic book fans would have been really annoyed by years ago m five episodes in and matt murdock is still running around with t shirt wrapped around the top of his head for mask think read that he ll have his costume by the last episode but why wait is that going to make it more plausible that he dressed like devil like said the show isn any fun ', ' don think that have ever fast forwarded through movie payed 22 to watch this movie disappoints expect some campy sections in science fiction movie but parts of this movie were just plain stupid don understand writers or producers trying to sneak musical sections into science fiction for the love of scifi please just stop trying to appeal to demographics who like musicals was hoping the failure at the box office was just fluke but now know why this movie failed the acting was fine the special effects good the story line sucks bottom line save your money save your time ', ' nice episode ever watched credit goes to every team members thanks for entertaining us mostly we can say this web series created for family entertainment ', ' sorry but really someone thought this script was good enough to make series out of honestly whoever paid to create this tv series needs to find another line of business utter rubbish should never have been made maybe at stretch alright for kids but for everyone else don bother it boring childish badly acted and totally pointless watched the first couple of episodes and that was enough couldn take anymore ', ' netflix marvel shows are everything most of us every hoped to see on screen for comics we love the punisher like the rest is top notch from acting to story to ambiance easily this will go down as the greatest punisher ever to bee seen on screen it is clear these shows are being cancelled because disney not playing ball fairly after buying marvel literally nothing else makes sense short of being totally fleeced netflix would have to be insane not to continue each of these shows but here we are i will never give disney dollar again m so tired of them ruining every single fun thing grew up with don understand how company expects to make more money assassinating every thing we love one film at time won have much faith in netflix either in the future if you can find way to make your best shows hand down stay on the air you are simply to impotent to trust with my money cancelling show with bad ratings ok but literally your best shows disney making fools of netflix with this situation don get me wrong as stated earlier disney will never get my money but doubt netflix will get it either ', ' same old marvel script shoot some people run around bit never die from life threatening injuries etc etc can believe actually fell for the pr hype ', ' ignoring all the backlash regarding brie larson and the hatedom controversy surrounding this movie thought the movie was just okay it not great but at the same time it not terrible it just kind of in the middle honestly was kinda expecting it to be as bad as ghostbusters 2016 or ocean 8 given the twitter nonsense surrounding it but really it just mediocre superhero movie which is kinda rare for the mcu even iron man 2 and thor the dark world had their moments this was just kinda there to me sure there were few scenes that were kinda cool but nothing too groundbreaking ', ' this show exemplifies what female lead can do with decent script and cool character krysten ritter flies with the character ably assisted by luke cage rachel taylor and there is not dull moment highly recommend ', ' honestly didn expect much from this film and it was much better than thought it was going to be but make no mistake it still middle of the road and weak story florence pugh outshone everyone in my opinion and have to agree the accents were terrible when will people realise outside of hard man cockney role ray winstone can act to save his life and m british was surprised taskmaster wasn in it as much as assumed that character felt bit wasted and can completely understand why people label this as filler film it like they had token tough villain and purposefully only wanted to scratch the surface and not go deeper into the character shame ', ' average mediocre unnecessary film it so bad d skip it even though m an mcu fan ', ' has to be amongst one of the worst marvel series gave up watching after episode 4 don know if they made it from the actual comics or just made something totally different to be honest doesn connect with the marvel fans in my views just doesn feel right or may say doesn fits right it actually feels like some 90 teen shows being marvel fan wanda vision was the best so far ', ' captain marvel is just about on the right side of entertaining it way above the turkey threshold but falls short of the accolade of good it the standard marvel template our heroine is presented as someone trying to find their place in the universe they go on an unexpected journey battling some bad guys and eventually discover their true power the effects are dated cartoonish and unremarkable thor 2011 had better fx the narrative is something of mess flashbacks to future events and substandard plot twists make for an uneccessarily confusing watch more effort should have been made to flesh out the new characters and keep the story simple there are few people who we can identify with including carol danvers because introductions to new characters and worlds are all too brief these are the main flaws and the marvel releases of late have tended to be of similar standard so captain marvel doesn fall way short it just that the benchmark is quite low on positive note carol danvers aka captain marvel is likeable and interesting character if bit ambiguous brie larson does the job well and fits in nicely with the longstanding universe characters ie shield some nice comic touches are woven into the script as usual without being too out of place overall the film held my interest despite the muddled start and standard lull that all super hero movies seem compelled to have in the middle tradtion upheld since superman 2 1980 ', ' let be honest the storyline was lackluster and there was no substance to the plot the acting from the three female leads was either average or over the top even the script and lines were meaningless and didn do justice to the theme of women empowerment which was supposed to be one the main focus of the movie guess it felt like the movie was trying too hard to be relatable which only made it worse overall there is nothing to anticipate in this movie and it is great disappointment it is unfortunate that we no longer produce meaningful movies that truly resonate with the audience it really disappointing to see how this movie could have been fantastic but it fell short of expectations ', ' interesting plotline could have finished it in 6 or 7 episodes the makers dragged it so far that it became boring to watch the last four episodes were pathetic ', ' watched this movie on disney plus and am glad didn had to pay ticket this movie is not very good with lots of plot holes acting was ok some of the actions scenes were good overall it was hard to be excited about character that you know dies ', ' agree with other reviewers it looks and feels more like nickelodeon series definitely written and aimed tweens some of the writing is bit camp and all over the place but it the first episode and m hoping it finds its feet not the series for me but that ok it will be for many others ', ' super heroes aren characters they are caricatures they are juvenile fantasy that has no basis in reality therefore movies like this one that try to earnestly focus on the backstory and family dynamics of superhero are doomed to fail imo superhero movies work when they are fun light hearted creative and don take themselves too seriously g thor ragnarok there are no action sequences or special effects in black widow that haven seen before and just wasn that interested in the fact that super assassin who was engineered by an evil soviet regime had dysfunctional family like scarlet johansson but there just wasn anything here for her to work with ', ' feels like job trying to get through this season slow boring agenda driven ', ' the avengers might be good follow up to five essentially unrelated movies that ties all the characters together and it might have great action but it suffers at the hands of joss whedon who should never be allowed near movies again the writing is corny and melodramatic the villain has cookie cutter motivation want to get the macguffin so can take over the world because m better which seems to be the case in these films loki was entirely forgettable as villain the scenes between black widow and hawkeye and phil coulson and nick fury had cringeworthy dialog and delivery one thing noticed which ve never noticed before in movie was that the lighting in all the indoor sections was really bad it made everything look like it was from 2004 nobody acted well in this movie but the three worst offenders were scarlett johansson samuel jackson and mark ruffalo all three are good actors actresses but scarlett was completely wooden as black widow jackson was corny as hell as fury and ruffalo reeked of high schooler trying to remember his lines for the school play all three of them have put in excellent performances before especially ruffalo in zodiac but here they all the bed robert downey jr also put in his most obnoxious tony stark performance yet mostly due to the horrible unfunny one liners he was given that kind of sums up the avengers one liners everyone even the god of thunder himself mostly just spews one liners at each other every character is tony stark even captain america there were good things though the fact that most of the conflict involved the avengers and their in fighting was great idea the action was really well done especially the helicarrier scene in which everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong the avengers had some good action and isn that enough well not it not not when your movie is two and half hours an hour and half of which being dialog there are better movies in this series like both captain america movies the first iron man and the incredible hulk if people like this movie that fine m fairly picky so m probably being too hard on it but to me this movie is highly overrated much like the franchise in general ', ' the film does well juggling large group of heroes and giving everyone enough screen time humour is splashed throughout the film and the tone isn too brooding d recommend getting up to speed on few of the other marvel films before watching this you ll have better understanding of what going on one of the biggest surprises and positives was the portrayal of bruce banner which thought came across as excellent with some really subtle details the contrasting personalities between iron man and captain america helps fuel the conflict as well as questions over nick furry motivations thor is conflicted over the responsibility he feels for his brother and his desire to protect the earth black widow is also torn up inside over the fate of hawkeye and the responsibility she feels for recruiting banner who certainly didn ask to join the avengers like men 2000 new hope 1977 independence day 1996 star trek 2009 the group spend lot of time bickering and only thinking of themselves as individuals for two thirds group until the final act where they learn to work together as team and defeat the crazed villain expect quite lot of cgi with the helicarrier the hulk and of course the final battle but all the fight sequences are well executed and you can tell the film had really good director behind it overall very classy and fan superhero film ', ' weak plot weak script and has problem with the cgi such dumb mcu movie ', ' jessica jones started off as curious enough oddity but not my thing is the nicest thing can say about it this is the anti cape and tights show we get it but any promise that the pilot held was pretty much gone over the proceeding few then something actually happens in episode 7 then it back to dullsville perked up when rosario dawson showed up in at the eleventh hour it wouldn be marvel without cross show marketing but that about it as recent marvel netflix product goes it certainly no daredevil the villain is awful but not david tennant he the most charming aspect and did like luke cage but it turns out really don like jessica jones kristen ritter seems fine she was great on breaking bad but just don like that character tough as nails doesn have to mean bitchy it would ve made for good movie but 13 episodes very saggy jones is not character want to stick with 4 10 ', ' action action action effects effects effects action effects effects action action effects don know maybe should give up on superhero movies or maybe marvel could put little effort into giving them some meaning two and half hours of stunning effects and breathtaking action great acting and directing interesting characters few witty remarks but all together is kind of vain and pointless the plot didn engage me didn relate to the characters and couldn care less what will happen to them there was no depth or point this is simply couple of hours of superficial fun for those who have fun shutting their brains out love the effects and the action and the adrenaline too but that not enough for me need the film to have strong story and depth if can have both ll always pick poorly filmed good story rather than superbly made nonsense still have to admit that it is really powerfully filmed and within the genre cannot go below 8 10 ', ' simply put this movie was not enjoyable in fact it was extremely boring probably rate it as one of the worst marvel movies the story was pretty rubbish you have an opportunity to make solo black widow movie and this is the best you can come up with the only reason gave this 5 stars and that is being very generous is because of florence her character was enjoyable don pay to see it in the cinema just stream it or watch it at your friends place not really worth paying money for ', ' this movie is just mess they tried but overall the entire movie makes no sense it feels very much like filler episode in series they wanted to fill some gaps and introduce other characters but in the end they simply did nothing more than make confusing movie you know it a problem when the cats are the best part of the movie sadly they are only on for about 20 minutes in total the rest of the movie you are simply sitting there wondering when it will get better or when this thing will start to make any real sense in the entire mcu hint it never does frankly if you never see this movie you will not miss thing ', ' this show follows formula like most of dinseys news super hero junk its funny how they claim this show is being review bombed when in reality people just dont like it does every show and movie with bad ratings qualify as being bombed get over yourself disney this is trash 2 stars because imagine kids would enjoy this but defintely not sane adults ', ' this series relies heavily on the protagonist catholicity you can tell the screenwriters are not catholic some kind of bizarre deformed attempt at catholic esque side loading train car for gravel moving vans for gravel ', ' as per marvel standard and deep pockets black widow extravagant fx is consistently engaging if singularity never emerges every time when the dust settles it leaves an ecocide no one cares crisply coordinated action sequences are slick in motion but uneventful in impact natasha is not superhuman still she can defy gravity survive grievous car crushes and take haymakers without batting her eyelids blood at the corner of her mouth is the maximal damage violence can incur to meet our eyes in the main black widow is predictable joyride of thrills and chills but most crucially it contests the male dominance of adrenaline driven entertainment with preponderance of women in action it sets an eloquence case no sane person can confute read my full review on my blog cinema omnivore thanks ', ' the acting is really bad and the main character is extremely annoying you really have to be miserable lonley and bored to watch this garbage mean maybe if your five year old you may like it ', ' it was different from other marvel projects in the best way ever looking forward to the nest episodes and the future of ms marvel don understand why people are hating on it calling it cringe even tho it realistic to the culture of ms marvel ', ' hi guys m here today to express my opinion about this show and forgive me for not using the english my en pt is very good but my pt en not so much m still insisting to see if this series will improve but the script is weak and the characters are the embodiment of boredom people rushed to believe in it because of the symbol of the marvel which gave boost to the producers not able to take advantage for fans of the genre there are several other series that does not have the same goal of this but can satisfy thank you already ewerton brfrozen ', ' the writers of the show have unmatched talent this show is everything always hoped for when think of syfy each season just gets better and better it feels like am watching multi million dollar budget movie every week congratulations for creating such beautiful masterpiece and can thank you enough for all the joy get out of watching marvel agents of shield ', ' when it comes to superhero movies have come to expect cheap clich plots and poorly directed action sequences lame self serious dialogue and mailed in performances are the norm in this genre black widow adds to long list of films that are infantilizing mainstream moviegoers rehashing the same tired material with the cinematic equivalent of fast food junk ', ' really hated this movie was very sceptic about it when first heard about captain marvel and when saw the actress was like oh god movie sucked 0 out of 10 too bad they put her in endgame because she has no value at all she hardly has any screen time so why waste those 3 seconds wished they put more effort in the bonding between hulk and black widow ', ' thought this was supposed to be an origin story for kamala khan ms marvel but these writers are all over the place just watched eoiside 5 of 6 and only 1 episode left and boy do we have alot of plot lines to close out why did we introduce sooo many new characters this late in the game did we have to got to pakistan for two episodes couldn we have done this in much shorter flashbacks why are the villains so dumb why is the damage control like division of shield where everyone flunked the entrance exam why aren we in new jersey her home turf for her origin we left all the interesting characters from episode 1 3 back there bad pacing poor writing and the things that don matter to me when reading or watching comic movies like race gender or religion are pushed to the forefront of this series know disney is trying to involve younger watchers but why dumb it down so much they should be trying to push intelligent writing with fun narratives if you dont push boundaries how can you grow this is simply not such goid overall series ', ' so ll make this really brief to avoid spoilers 1st season is 10 2nd season is an 8 3rd season is 5 the first season of jessica jones is an absolute must watch you should stick around for season 2 and there are parts of season 3 that made me want to nail my hand to my desk bad pacing and lazy writing would love to see an edit of those episodes where all the horvath scenes were cut out anyway this is unique show that crackles with potential that was not lived up to in the later seasons ', ' like most people know have been very disappointed with the recent marvel movies hoping the next one will redeem the mcu with that attitude walked into the theater unfortunately this was not the movie to redeem the mcu but it wasn all bad either this all means if you re expecting an end game or infinity war type of movie or even the first captain marvel type of movie you ll be disappointed but this is fun movie there are your serious action stuff like what you expect from marvel movie but with ms marvel in there there were also your silly and fun moments some of it bit over the top but overall it was fun film so lower your expectations and you ll enjoy the movie ', ' setting this dumpster fire in new jersey is literally the only thing about it that makes any sense if you like the comic book character ms marvel you re going to hate this ', ' what is marvel thinking this is wrong on like 20 level start over with better people and writing it like you need to be 10 year old to enjoy this cos at ten it all blur ', ' the film captain marvel has well designed script but the film leaves something to be desired in it tells the story of very powerful heroine without many connections with the other universes of marvel begins with some scenes without senses but in the course of the film these scenes fit after its arrival to earth its past and present fuse and stay more interesting after she finds out who one day she was in the end it the usual that everyone expected of the heroine she extremely strong and with very clich power in my opinion and with that enormous power makes the other characters almost useless compared to the strength of carol danvers in the end she goes to the space in search of something logically this film is an introduction to the other films of marvel thought that even with lot of amazing effects all the editing work they did they still want bit of the script and they forced it to look like one of marvel strongest characters and still have the problem with actors of expressions on their faces that left the film little without the emotions since the marvel films usually leave their viewers full of emotion this film could have been better with more time for preparation of actors and actresses or new actors i really feel like throwing money in the trash to watch such horrible movie love all the other marvel movies but this movie will never watch again ', ' jon berenthal is the best punisher and honestly remember when he was first cast thought he be terrible he kind of plays that angry anti hero type guy the same way all the time but nope he was great in this role he was the first actor to play the role with pathos and dimension wasn a big fan of the very first punisher movie with dolph lungren but did like the next two actors jane and stephenson but none hold candle to berenthal portrayal of frank castle now the second season thought was little weaker than the first but this is the guy who should be playing this role in the marvel movies ', ' there are 100 of fan compilations far better than this on youtube they had access to all the marvel producers marvel history directors actors crews and this is what they do high school visual arts club could do better than this ', ' after watching moon knight and then this couldn control my self it is very boring and lifeless overacting and cringy dialogues too felt like the show is bound to one place putting only colourful and beautiful vfx is not going to impress the audience and fans what waste series ', ' this is by far the worst thing to come out of the mcu want six hours back agenda trash marvel needs to get back to what works don need heroes for no reason give us characters we care about and stories that have depth this is just woke nonsense to appease today mess ', ' this isn that bad of show but it obviously geared towards little girls which am not also the acting and writing is pretty mediocre so far if you just discovered your first period you are gonna love this show but to most people would suggest to skip this one ', ' very poor content few acion scenes are good apart from that nothing special in the movie its such boring that few might also leave this in between ', ' why completely change the powers the character has for that matter why make show based on character that has been rebooted at least twelve times ', ' m not an avid comic book reader but know enough about the punisher character to know that this series should have lot more action in it lot of other reviewers are saying that it is slow and much more of drama and that is certainly correct ve watched every marvel show on netflix so far and this is by far not the worst however compared to the show where frank castle the punisher makes his debut daredevil season 2 it hard to place this show in the same rating stratosphere as it it starts out with little bit of action but drags on with bunch of dialogue and sub plots and sub character development that just isn needed jon bernthal does good job playing frank castle and the acting is pretty good throughout with all the characters however it is just very slow moving and not enough action that you would expect for series called the punisher overall it could have been lot more action packed and could have spent lot less time with over redundant dialogue and less drama as far as marvel goes this is probably 2 3 on the whole marvel comic book heroes series but still doesn come close to the daredevil series in whole matter fact the punisher in daredevil season 2 was probably better than this series overall ', ' as seasoned mcu fan this is not for me its childish tone is lot worse than the hawkeye series it was very slow burn they could of cut few episodes and not miss anything it got little more interesting the last 2 eps but overall the series was pretty dry and boring ', ' just effects on effects on effects bad effects no story look at your wall instead ', ' please bring daredevil back loved the show from the acting to the dark gritty story was so disappointed they cancelled the show refused to watch s3 but finally did today sept 21 made me even more mad after watching it it was the best to date still believe this series will be back ', ' season 1 8 stars season 2 2 stars absolutely appalling season 2 they chose the worst characters to follow and immaturely develop in season 2 this show would have benefitted the direction it initially steer towards near the start of season 2 away from season 1 ', ' the jury is still out as there is still two episodes left but just cannot get into this at all the acting is quite awful the villains are not convincing and the writing is just generally half hearted think this being released at the same time as the boys season three just emphasises the gulf in quality unless this ties into the mcu in more meaningful way in the latter episodes of the season then this may well be the easiest series to skip entirely just don waste your time ', ' watched but couldn t like it very much this is action movie but could see action just twenty minutes shortly 15 action 10 mythology 75 dialog in my opinion captain america movie is ok hulk movies is ok iron man movies ok h e d movie is ok but hero team movie avengers is poor than others this is movie which you can watch in your spare time 8 6 rating is too much for this movie it can be around 5 average also movie action scenes look like computer game trailer movie story is better than movie digitized action scenes this movie hasn got story enough ', ' don know what to say other than the actors are terrible the writing is awful and the special effects look straight out of the 80 none of the characters act like they re real people in real situations and honestly disney should be embarrassed they released this maybe it might get better in later episodes but ll never know because it was absolute pain getting through just the first episode ', ' at first like many marvel fans was biased towards this project given the failure of the daredevil movie but we were so wrong as this series turned out to be not one of the best if not best tv series based on any marvel property but overall one the best superhero tv shows of all time the dark tone the photogenic streets of new york city the gripping storyline well developed characters and great acting especially charlie cox made of this series one of the many gems of netflix which is not easy feat given the large amount of excellent shows it has to offer season 1 was one hell of ride through the crime ridden hell kitchen which gaves us perspective of the corner of the world inhabited by the daredevil cast it was cold dark and brutal but at the same time oozing with life it concluded in satisfying way it worth mentioning its great coreography and fight scenes and their massive quality which remained constant in later seasons especially the oners season 2 was massive letdown at times unwatchable the only thing that gave life to this season was the punisher and his presence but overall and aside from frank castle storyline this second season felt like filler created only to lay building grounds for the defenders miniseries another letdown on its own right season 3 was an excellent return to form going back to the formula used in season 1 it focused again on daredevil one man war against the organized crime of new york city and the deep corruption of the juridic system needless to say by introducing new characters it created amazing new character dynamics that wove together the storyline of this season the ending felt like closure but at the same like an opportunity to continue the story which sadly will never happen the stunning production values brilliant acting complex narrative stellar fight choreography and examination of morality and consequences of our actions made of this series an unforgettable and visceral experience make no mistake despite being superherp show this one is not for the faint of heart as it is visit to dark corner of the marvel universe that at times was too realistic and felt like our world ', ' what was that went to this movie last night with high hopes and great expectations and was right in fact this movie exceeds all expectations will not spoil anything here and really don know where to start marvel in its best suite ever finally they did it they gathered them in one freaking movie the avengers used to watch each one of them alone or perhaps some of them together in the animated movies but to watch this movie with this cast am still impressed never thought they would make this movie like that way they made it for the ages guess the cast was perfect and everyone knew what he will do and knew his rule there were some funny moments in the movie which everyone in the theater was laughing loudly at action scenes were perfectly made top notch in fact every single shot in the movie counts every single shot was perfectly made really loved the assembly of the cast together robert downy jr still has it the whole cast is perfect watch this movie you will be satisfied gave it 9 out of 10 watch and feel free to watch again and again you will love it ', ' this film is entertaining it is fun and has some amusing lines but at the end of the day is nothing more than the culmination of marketing scheme started in 2008 with the iron man film didn like that film then felt like spiderman with different coat of paint and this one feels like men yes there stunts and action but lets be honest scarlett johansen looks like she working out what to buy with her fee throughout the entire thing the 3 effects were awful bar the flying arrow at the end and samuel jackson is there to merely spout expositionary dialogue more at home in saturday morning kids cartoon there will be more it will make fortune in world where whole first world countries are going bankrupt and it will be forgotten in about one years time ', ' fight scenes are awesome and the rest huge chunk of the middle portion is extremely boring it made me pause 3 times and come back to finish it ', ' there is no connectivity between scenes so many mysteries not explained clearly how does she and kamran even get their powers who are jins why they don age like others hope marvel doesn plan for season 2 ', ' m baffled by the number of positive reviews regarding this show decided to watch it when read reviews stating it was masterpiece of the small screen and must watch frankly it started ok but soon became bit boring and repetitive it took massive nose dive once luke cage was introduced because that guy is one seriously bad actor there were too many characters which felt superfluous and quite unnecessary was glad when it was over and absolutely will not be bothering with the next 2 seasons on the plus side krysten ritter was very good as was david tennant just shame they had little to work with ', ' good detective series with superhero and vigilante stuff it a detective series more than investigations it has good dramas first of all writers did great job in characterisation for the characters eventhough season 2 3 misses the intriguing kinda storytelling as season 1 somehow it manages by intresting character arc season 1 was totally good and the best season of the series season 2 3 were good too but bit boring sometimes not upto the mark of season 1 we can easily notice series majorly missed good production value so making wise it was bit odd action sequences were mostly clumsy cast did great job especially krysten ritter as jessica jones was impressive overall good series to watch season 1 was best season 2 and 3 watch it for the intresting character arc ', ' they say they have bread and circuses think this movie would fit along lazy plot development boring action scenes that are completely unbelievable and made up of low effort cgi pure spectacle with zero substance these movies get progressively worse when have seen them throughout the years hopefully they can drain these and other franchises for the next several decades ', ' just finished the last two episodes grand finale series finale most of the show was teary eyed lol nice to see old faces it was nice way to end the series going to miss it hopefully maybe disney will pick it up and finish it up but most likely it probably done ', ' loved the first episode and the tone it sets for the series the characters are fun and look forward to seeing the show progress seeing her animated imagination is great touch ', ' episode 1 was blast this show is nothing but fun and doesn take itself too seriously in the best way m looking forward to the rest of the season the power change works just fine the heart of ms marvel is there and this is just the beginning for her actress don let others deter you give it chance don take yourself too seriously and you ll enjoy it ', ' this is one best unique marvel series the way that they execute this firat episode is really attractive its colurful and the background score iman valani did her best in this series she is superb addition to the mcu ', ' this movie has has the grip which everyone one wants while watching the movie screenplay is brilliant and cast has been picked basis the story which shows perfect thought process of the director one can understand how this movie would have narrated according to the script binge history director has brought the exact outcome what can be expected from the cast selected for the movie and music is also good which adds brightness of the movie beautiful subject and scope is also fantastic will hit box office if support is provided to movie will request all to support such movie because efforts must be valued by the society and gives courage to the newcomers as well ', ' this is by far the worst show ve seen from marvel the story was absolute garbage what they were thinking were the show writers high or something can say more this was pure and utter garbage feel for the young actress it not her fault but she was also not good in terms of acting and oo before you guys say white men don like diverse shows m pakistani ', ' ll tell you whats not secret this show is terrible and is used as another failed attempt by marvel disney to try and sell captain marvel as their flagship hero because they are frothingly desperate to have wonder woman status type female character ', ' was really excited for this but honestly can get past the animation it so choppy and stiff and goes 1 frame per second at times saw the first 2 episodes and can get over it it just looks like cheap rush job done on computer as fast as they could with not much of any budget know of the comic character and all great design for character but even in comics he was only popular for 5 minutes about 10 years ago ', ' well ve never expected from marvel to release show based on magic and chalice like thing the first episode was kind of interesting but the next episode was so booring moon knight was far better than this show as well as shang chi this is literally rubbish it for kids would not suggest ', ' the marvels the latest spectacle in the marvel cinematic universe ironically forgets the spectacle part it trudges along plot so predictable you might mistake it for rerun of sitcom you ve seen dozen times the leading trio talented in their own right give performances reminiscent of three friends nonchalantly browsing sales on black friday more invested in finding good deal than saving the world their lackluster portrayal robs the characters of any real depth reducing them to mere caricatures in capes the direction seems as uninspired as reheated meal missing both the visual flair and narrative depth that usually mark the mcu successes action scenes more like action routines lacking any of the franchise trademark excitement despite its polished production the marvels ends up as bland forgettable chapter in an otherwise thrilling saga much like finding out the big sale only offers last season leftovers ', ' the film isn likely to go down in marvel history as much more than footnote nor does it tell us much about the studio next phase the pieces are great but the execution leaves plenty to be desired after an entire year of no marvel movies on the big screen it difficult not to recommend this as worthy escapist popcorn fun but that it ', ' in terms of black widow being an action movie it was great there was lot of action that really enjoyed it was impressive especially seeing the almost nonstop action in woman led superhero movie the intro credits with the slowed version of nirvana and photographs of girls makes me emotional every single time watch this since first seeing it upon release ve wanted to look into the too many girls situation the horrific observation by drakov it may be rarely considered issue but the movie makes its impact on the issue of course florence pugh and david harbour stole the show but m eager to see them reunited in thunderbolts thank you scarlett johansson for making sure this movie was empowering and inspirational as cheesy as that may seem the action and story can be enjoyed by all but the power remains with young girls to old women ', ' really fricking good show nothing more nothing less to say ', ' what like about the show gifted not wearing stupid costumes gifted not constantly oozing with glory and heroism convincing villain that demonstrates how powerful talent would actually be what disliked too long too many silly and unnecessary side characters the conflict goes back and forth back and forth main character constantly make stupid mistakes with dramatic consequences very unprofessional if they don the stupid side characters step in and ruin everything so yet another episode becomes necessary the ending was meant to be oh so smart but basically was rather bland think 8 epsiodes would have been more than enough after seeing jj swear drink whiskey like tea and go back into her broken office for the hundredth time it just grows lame she did not convince as private investigator she is just an antisocial bi making wrong decisions without pause don know why they chose the actress that looks like michael jackson younger sister meeting neil gaiman death in the comics she clearly has brown hair the effects are just bearable but the whole series has low budget feel to it guess they chose mind control over death ray for reason as plot in some scenes accept her or cage being superstrong in others it just not convincing enough they did good job with kilgrave perfect actor and put much more thought into what sociopath like him would and could actually do with such power they should have kicked out the pheromone bs though also the virus explanations are pretty lame am going to watch daredevil now although he is one of the most stupidly looking costumed heroes have ever seen and never liked his story the very best about the series was actually the opening score from wondered and how did that bring on the story any further 2 or 3 times during the series it is just reset and repeat triggered by her boring and overdrawn neighbours although they tried to show jj inner conflicts they hardly convinced me lot of potential wasted yet still watchable series with quality going down and down after episode 5 or 6 ', ' it not great superhero movie but it also not bad movie either this origin movie will remind you of mcu 1st phase origin movies like iron man thor it first act is slow but the story is quite impressive although it could have been better brie larson performance as carol danvers is convincingly good goose and talos are the real show stealers and young nick fury is funny as hell it a family friendly and bit of emotional movie ', ' tooootally adore this mini show from marvel all these great characters these legends it was so fun and interesting honestly to watch can wait for more ', ' the marvels is simply one of the worst comic book movies ever saw and the worst marvel movie even worse then howard the duck the only comic book movie worse was harley quinn what do the marvels and harley quinn have in common they are made for tween girls not for adults especially not for adult males what did like kamala she was fun character but that is about it the worst those loud explosions and flashing lights have never seen movie that showed as many lights as this one did also could not stand monica who brought nothing to the table especially her easter egg it was nothing but promo for the next film she is in something to avoid like the plague then there is carol brie larson there is nothing original about her she is rip off of superman she even has his look when she flies would like to be generous and give the marvels one star because of kamala but because there is too much bad stuff including that cat cannot it deserves no stars although have to list it as one star according to imdb rules simply put the worst marvel movie zero stars from me ', ' this is possibly the only marvel show where you really think that the fisk of the world can actually do lot more benefit for any city than the so called superheroes while moral actions need justifiability wars don as history has proven someone needs to make serial on characters like fisk who get badmouthed and pained by superheroes the lead is really poor in this show and has no punch its more he senseless ways he wins and villains actually much better and sensible ', ' really disliked it setting aside all the controversy brie larson looks like she never acted before at all every line she says sounds awkward bland and doesn match the tone of any of the scenes almost as if she reading from the script while trying to act it out unable to display emotion whether it in her voice or in her body language without it looking staged never being able to play the character convincingly let alone most of the cast as for the character herself she is portrayed to be overpowerful for the antagonists boring audiences for making hero that wins all pthe time with no struggles showing the capability to get out of traps and situations as if she was never in them to begin with greatly lacking character depth being displayed as one dimensional mary sue with little to no backstory human flaws human struggles or character growth all things that are required to make believable character almost as if she was real human perfect example being luke skywalker or zuko nevertheless the plot is uninteresting and boring since there nothing special about it at all just typical woman saves the day type of plot but will pay my respect to stan lee by giving this review full star ', ' mcu how missed you ve never been disappointed by marvel movies some are certainly better than others but all serve purpose in the grand story telling black widow let us proudly say goodbye and hello to wonderful and inspiring characters trust me you will very much enjoy your time with this family the black widow is dead long live the black widow ', ' why why use samuel jackson not only unpleasant but also unlikable world worst actor skip skip skip everyone else was great just him omg terrible ', ' honestly what did you expect movie was terrible was barely able to watch it over the top action too much cgi unnecessary dialogue and terrible story writing that is what this movie has to offer ', ' lame and boring not much more to add it feels like fan made series rather than real marvel serie like loki also the message is really clear here ', ' blaahhhhh total waste of time boring can get refund the worst movie of the mcu so far and that includes the reboot of the fantastic four save your cash and time wait couple of weeks and stream it for free still not worth doing that either boring ', ' start watching this series with all love love cp marvel love iman vellani energy love kangkubai love mcu and more but the more watch this series the more lose my love it boring and focus on the wrong stuffs didn get any excitement from any scene at all so gave it chance but not for me ', ' first was arrow which was so laughably cheesy and boring that could barely get though 3 or 4 episodes then came agents of shield which looked like it was just for kids but then here came daredevil and it turned out to be really really cool so had hopes for jessica jones didn happen the show has style that true the conflict between jessica and her nemesis kilgrave is pretty engaging there are some good moments and the nemesis is pretty terrifying with his power ll tell you that but the storyline is not especially engaging and it not because of slow pace it because it just often not really interesting didn sympathize with most of the characters so didn really care what happened to them the story takes twists and turns but while some of them are cool and unexpected others just seem weird and awkward most of all m annoyed by jessica don get me wrong krysten ritter is doing terrific job and she nice and like her personally but the character annoys me screenplay wise when started watching the first episode thought wow lots of female characters made to look like stereotypical male characters don like to see female characters who gulp down bourbon like coke without wincing yet don have any signs of alcoholism wake up with perfect face and smoothly shaved armpits because decapitation is fine but not smoothly shaved armpits would apparently kill our gentle viewer ve seen real broken women that not how they look and don think super strength would really mean much here if you re trying to make serious tv and it seems pretty serious by the amount of dark past and haunting memories all the characters seem to have so much in fact that there barely any relief in the storyline you can make things that unnatural if you want to see broken people check out true detective imo this show fails to create perfect balance between comic book feel and realism between darkness and lightness that daredevil achieved ', ' didn felt anything special other than first modern big screen super hero team up movie ', ' black widow to me in these movies has always been staple she brings her game and character each movie or cameo she in to not be super hero but hero great mom the less ve always looked for her parts in marvel movies cause she brings it ', ' the show started off with bang amazing direction great cinematography sharp comedy good political social commentary and pretty good action however as the episodes went on the quality just seems to drop off cliff it feels like they put all their budget in the first few episodes and then just winged it it was tough watching that show slowly devolve into cw level drivel with no real substance and what a shame is they had distinctly original superhero origin story to tell and just well turned it into cw type family dramedy with lackluster action scenes and shiny shoehorned effects hope they can salvage this with better second season ms marvel can be dope as hell ', ' great acting all over superb fight choreography brilliant story and villains marvel is doing great in terms of movies but pulling the plug on this show would be mistake when its is already very famous and liked by all it would only be wise to keep this show alive with its original characters cz they are doing an awesome job ', ' here my review and will keep it fairly spoiler free was expecting this show to be pretty cringe not going to lie but really enjoyed this pilot episode great pacing great visuals and some of the special effects are really cleverly done sure some people are complaining that her powers are not comic accurate but actually quite like the element that she is purley just marvel fan and not an actual hero ignore the negative reviews and give this chance am an older mcu fan starting from iron man and this definitely caters to the older audience as well as the younger ', ' wanted to watch mcu level entertainment feels like nickelodeon level garbage stunts are cheap graphics are cheaper could pass as something you watch on lifetime or hallmark channel ', ' great show what greater is the story which is brilliantly made connecting all those dots from daredevil season 2 hands off to the stunt choreographers and coordinators which made those amazing fights was pretty violent but marvelous there was balanced dark light theme episode 10 was so creative the way they edited it was so interesting that if the story was shown from start to finish it would ve been bad it really cool that they introduced these characters first and then linking their comic roles than jumping directly to their comic roles like jigsaw but overall great show from netflix and marvel ', ' it ok really boring though not as good asmara everyone says m sorry but it not the opening scene is confusing and pointless and just has dc universe like final fight scene ', ' loki attempts to enslave planet earth this is an entertaining movie with impressive spectacle and solid character moments the plot for me is okay as loki and the chitari never truly feel like plausible threat however the character time it gives to various superheroes is exceptionally good putting so many comic book characters on the stage at the same time is difficult concept but this is done well with some excellent dialogue and creative uses of their powers in various situations some of the banter from characters like black widow iron man loki and captain america is wonderfully written and delivered there are some fights that feel bit forced to bring fanboys fantasies like thor ironman or thor hulk to life however they are admittedly fun to watch what does get bit much is the sheer volume of hyperkinetic cgi heavy action sequences they are fantastically designed but for me there is too much of it personally would have replaced some of this with quieter character moments but this is just matter of taste it goes without saying that all the visuals are high quality throughout the film my favourite sequence is the stuttgart scene which is beautifully filmed edited scored and climaxes with some heroic posturing from the avengers when the hulk goes the rampage in the helicarrier there is brilliant scene transition from him punching someone through wall to shot of iron man emerging from similar shaped hole in different wall the climactic battle scene is massive piece of spectacle and it includes some of the most impressive effects and cgi sequences in recent years at the risk of sounding like killjoy some of the impressive feats of heroism performed by the avengers do seem like they have been included for the sake of coolness such as no look shots and other solo moves the avengers contains number of solid performances for me scarlet johansson has the most powerful screen presence and mark ruffalo makes perfect bruce banner robert downey jr is as charismatic as ever whilst chris evans chris hemswoth samuel jackson and jeremy renner are all solid tom hiddleston is lot of fun as loki for me it is an 8 5 10 but round upwards ', ' when we first meet private investigator jessica jones ritter snark personified she a recovering rape survivor she has ptsd as we see from the coping mechanism of naming her childhood home streets and her symptoms these include trouble falling asleep and even when she does such as on the subway which gives you an idea of how badly she needs to rest the smell and noise of it alone seems like it should be enough that you could never catch zs not to mention how many people around you don trust being vulnerable near she almost immediately comes to the reason for this is simple whenever she starts to lose consciousness immediately it feels like her abuser is right behind her whispering in her ear licking her her trauma is taken seriously and it put front and center that man is kilgrave tennant making meal of it he literally does not have empathy and it is explained why his power others have to do anything he says which basically means that he can either get everything he wants or he can carefully think about every word that comes out of his mouth you can probably guess which he chooses an emotionally stunted narcissist he literally can compel others to fulfill his lightest whim and he claims to actually love our pi and want her to be happy he carries out what he believes are grand romantic gestures not seeming to understand that while he apparently did think of her as someone that he wants to spend the rest of his life with she wants nothing more to do with him she was his prisoner and if he legitimately wanted to know if she felt the same all he had to do is tell her she had to be truthful and ask and yet he didn maybe he knew the answer perhaps it was just too big of risk to take either way it ended up with him forcing her in reality there are no people who can force anyone they talk to to do what they want make them think they want it make them go along against their better judgement but there are lots who can do that with select few it called gaslighting and it something we need to put stop to she not alone in fighting him her adoptive sister former child star and current radio personality trish walker taylor spot on she used to be known as the titular star of kid show it patsy which is also how lot of people greet her when they recognise her every so often we ll get another titbit of it like hearing the theme song sitting in on the tail end of table read hearing someone describe one of the plots they really got it exactly right know that watched stuff just like it when was growing up she a lot more stable and dependable at least these days she definitely wasn always and we will see her struggle she feels strong drive to make the world better place and may not always feel like she is doing enough for that add to that next door neighbor malcolm ducasse darville exactly right starts out addicted to drugs occasionally he needs minor assistance he gets it and that basically it at first people don really think much of him and neither does the audience which makes for very effective turn when he quits cold turkey and becomes sober he becomes full person in our mind as he in reality of course always was we just didn look past the veneer it forces us to confront that maybe we accidentally did this in real life as well this also greatly encourages empathy for sex workers the unhoused and ethnic minorities it has lot of emotional intelligence in discussing these immensely relevant issues and it manages to make everyone complex someone she sometimes works with without either of them particularly liking the other it is very much case of mutual respect for the other abilities and intense distaste for personal choices is jeri hogarth moss impeccable she a lawyer who worked hard to get to the top and we watch as her life starts to come apart around her on show full of trainwrecks who make lousy decisions that end up hurting themselves she may well be the one who has made the most mistakes and stands to lose the most it would be easy for this to devolve into finger pointing so it very impressive that it never does after she grew up poor and bullied she put immense effort into gaining and maintaining complete control of the circumstances of her life and most of the problems she faces are specifically because of selfish choices rather than things that she simply couldn do anything about hers is tragedy of fighting to escape one extreme only to end up at another this is noir story that means that it has shadows silhouettes well lot of the time the cinematography is not that adventurous sax music investigative work conspiracy and corruption when it features sex it isn shot in male gaze in fact occasionally it will be distinctly female with focus on fingers and lips rather than legs and curves it isn there just for titillation it establishes and grows characters and their interpersonal relationships there is distinct effort made to avoid anyone on this coming across as disposable and it rarely fails this was shot on location in new york and it adds lot of texture essentially the only criticism have is the pacing like the other netflix shows each season is mandated to be 13 episodes and they just don have the right amount of story for that this features bloody gory graphic violence disturbing content and strong language recommend it to any fan of complex narratives 9 10 ', ' yea still love coulson nice little one shot that purely fan service nice to watch but forgettable coulson makes it better so think 7 10 is alright ', ' guaranteed good time and the movies check it out for yourselves before hopping on the insecure misogynists bandwagon compelling action humor emotion pacing and performances great job everyone ', ' of all the netflix marvel series currently available the punisher is by far the best this unfortunately is not saying much considering that all the other series are disaster and torture of source material in reality the punisher is mediocre product with predictable story full of typical netflix cheap moralization tedious and tiring overplayed acting style of jon bernthal does not help much too but the worst is that this is not show about superhero this is show about regular marine with ptsp syndrome and some supporting characters that frankly cant remember not two months after watching the series too bad ', ' really can complain that we don have enough female superheroes without male being on the sidelines as her hero and chaperone and am simply not all about that give me more female superheroes and will watch them all please also don need any love interest thought the cats and singing were very corny and do think it was treated unfairly the writing was weird and seemed suited for 12 year olds it had completely different mood from captain marvel am still looking forward to seeing thunderbolts and might just watch it at the theater can believe just started watching captain marvel movies could have seen them at the cinema don think they have the chemistry as trio but overall it a fun watch ', ' this show is beautiful mix of diversity action friendship fun as white person am loving learning about different culture love the style of the show and all the fun animations as well ', ' daredevil one of the best series in the history okay it the best superhero tv series and the actors were great and the best of them of course was charlie cox he was doing great in acting the character of matthew murdock aka daredevil the storyline was great it not boring at all the soundtrack was one of the best soundtracks heard in my life it really deserves 10 rating ', ' where to start which is worse the lead actress acting or the drill pump sex interludes don get me wrong kristen ritter is very cute in dorky kind of way but tough cynical boozing world weary pi with her single expression constant dead eyed adolescent pout reminds me why was so happy when walter white decided not to wake her up not that it all her fault mean when lush asks clerk for the cheapest bourbon on the shelf in the next scene she drinking wild turkey someone is pulling someone leg or when jessica is indulging in gymnastic sex with luke how come he always naked she mostly fully clothed the most likely answer is that he in far better shape than she is then there are all the obligatory pc tropes lesbians in power roles put upon african american victims kinky incestuous sort of funny neighbors the overall plot comes off like bad rip off of the following that had kevin bacon in the jessica role boy memories taste do get shorter shorter ', ' great movie and amazing last series thanks to the curators ', ' the worst disjointed effort marvel has done regardless of their target market this seems more like cable television attempt at superhero show than anything else the writing is disjointed and slow while each episode seems to pick up randomly with plot points that were not discussed easily the worst thing marvel has ever done and it sad because kamala khan is beloved comic book character kevin feige needs to take look in the mirror after this one because it had no vision zero inspiration and has been truly bad show ', ' garbage when models try to act vol 5 this show is horrendous bunch of trash for the attention defecit generation pure garbage ', ' daredevil is character didn know much about before watching the show wasn too sure how d like the show since wasn a fan of the character before hand if anything the show has made me fan of daredevil everything about the show is well done fighting scenes are perfection some dialogue scenes were bit slow at times but that the only complaint could form after watching this season his origins and early life were handled in perfect way short flashback scenes every now and then made me actually want to see more and the fact that the acting in all of those flashback scenes was great helped them really make an impact grew to like the characters and cannot wait to see more awesome action character growth and daredevil epic story to continue ', ' cant quite get it why the high ratings to so many mediocre series of late this series is of the classic example of said mediocre series that has high ratings 8 9 to be specific the key ingredients to make good series movie was completely messed up in this series let us start first with acting over 90 of the cast sucked at acting with the two lead supporting actors begin th worst of the bunch the guy playing foggy seems just plain onset and when he gives off any emotion it gets even bad the one playing karen also doesn belong here she needs to be in one of those teen drama series which would suit her better then there is fisk what an atrocious voice he had mean why cant they let him speak normally he sounded lame whenever he spoke the one and only actor who was doing well was the one called leland when he came and freed us of the boring and shitty acting yet they tried to kill him and leave some one like karen actor on what stupid directing then there is the crappy plot the series lacks any form of direction you don exactly know where its call leading up to today is this another time that then it goes back same way again what bore its silly to waste anymore of my holiday time on this crap my advice don be like me and let the ratings fool you you are better of not wasting your time on this crap if you want something more interesting you can always turn to gotham ', ' am not comic book fan or even reader not even when was kid and ve only seen the first ten episodes of season 1 so keep this in mind given this kudos to the writers and many of the actors especially onofrio this is good character development like the complexities of both the main character and the villain especially onofrio portrayal of the latter on the surface the daredevil character is the good guy and the villain character the bad guy but the lines are blurred as the episodes unfold and all characters become more complex and humanized the violence is extreme but fits with the nature of the story and setting hence it is not gratuitous it is battle in hell by people who are trapped in world without redemption or grace it is battle against good and evil by people who are complex and wounded theologically speaking it is spiritual battle but without supernatural grace the main character the daredevil is flawed human too and unable to provide salvation for those he cares about the villain is unable to gain redemption for what he done no matter how much we sympathize with him suffering pervades the entire environment no one is able to escape even though all yearn for it just like in classic epic the daredevil is the hero with the tragic moral flaw the villain is character with whom the reader viewer can sympathize and all the supporting characters are emotionally accessible and all these human characters are trapped in setting from which they cannot escape not just hell kitchen but from themselves ve seen other reviews by those who ve watched more of the series and from those who are fans of the comic book series to them may not be able to disagree if were to be in their position but to me this is good storytelling so far ', ' the mcu has absolutely overstayed its welcome post avengers endgame these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema except the rare surprises like gotg 3 superhero fatigue they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11 you watch the trailer you know what happens you bet on originality you end up homeless there nothing new for me to say that haven already said about any of the other mcu content as of late it so generic that m confident year from now no one would remember this movie even existed with every new mcu project the jokes per minute ratio keeps getting worse the villains are writer version of stock photograph can even remember the villain name in this movie and it hasn even been day since watched it the cgi is so out there you can almost see the cgi artists tears on screen and it getting more and more difficult to tell each mcu project apart cos they re all just the same the only few positives can identify here are actresses iman vellani and brie larson larson who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots and maybe the flashy action sequences otherwise there nothing here to watch nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy what shame ', ' what have we got ll tell ya we got women that are strong we got women that are independent we got women that kiss women and women that kiss women to cheat on other women we got women that drink whiskey and even fight we got women that are angry and women that live rough did you think women can act like men well newsflash it is 2018 and jessica jones shows that women can do things ', ' the trailer looked promising so decided to give it shot the story is dismal with poor screenplay but the technical aspects are top notch characters performance lived up to the hype but khan was bit overly cocky all in all if you have no shows to watch this would be the last option ', ' do little analyse about this web site and you gonna discover that most people voting don even watch the show most of the negative reviews are from the first episode first year look at the true detective serie most of the review are for the first season second seasons was abyssal and even after that awful season the rating stay higher than 9 season 2 of true detective not worth even 5 of rating also people are voting in the top 50 100 list result they vote for the same serie over and over rise the popularity of the already top 100 series which are old reviews from the first season result series with slow introduction of all characters in the first season are totally eclipsed this serie is as good as firefly if not better this is made by the same guy better than any star trek or any actual super heroes series except maybe the punisher but punisher is total different beast worth the trip let see what is next ', ' depsite countless additions to the beloved mcu the avengers maintains its place among the franchise best it serves as culmination of phase 1 marvel yet also lays the groundwork for much of what comes after it is pillar lightning rod in the long gestating cinematic franchise and exemplifies everything that not only comic movie should be but sound film in general should be in the future some may look back at this era of the mcu as the golden age of marvel film and they just might be right ', ' by far the best marvel serie on netflix coming from the defenders was so much surprised about this shos very nice music and great rendition by the actors ', ' the movie has good plot and it visually really good looking the movie is quite emotional and brutal it also makes the movie more sad if you have seen avengers end game and know what happends to natasha the movie shows the strong and the vulnerable side of the characters the fighting scenes are good and the movie also has some comical moments personally recommend ', ' had really high expectations with the interesting background of natasha romanoff and her training in the red room and how she escaped and became an avenger and the beginning was really good especially the opening credits with smells like teen spirit was one of the best things marvel has ever made in the dark cinema and the loud music everyone had goosebumps and it was an fantastic atmosphere but sadly after that the movie took turn to classic normal unsepectecular action movie and didn used the potential the story would have had so overall it is solid action movie nothing special and nothing bad but in my opinion one of the worse mcu movies ', ' the headline is pretty much the whole review tbh yup great acting but so so slow existential angst being repeated theme with murdoch and co coming to grips with being vigilante every season ', ' let me make this clear m not going to pay much attention to this show she not only admitted she over texts kevin but somehow bragged about telling tom hiddleston he talks too much this kind of attitude helps no one and if she thinks she is going to get far with that she is mistaken every episode will get one single star from me ', ' the marvels 2024 directed by nia dacosta is superhero film in the marvel cinematic universe mcu that brings together three iconic characters carol danvers captain marvel brie larson monica rambeau photon teyonah parris and kamala khan ms marvel iman vellani plot the film follows the intertwined stories of these three superheroes as they face new threat that threatens the entire universe carol danvers monica rambeau and kamala khan must work together to overcome their differences and unite their powers to save the day characters brie larson delivers strong performance as carol danvers showcasing her leadership skills and determination teyonah parris shines in her role as monica rambeau bringing sense of freshness and energy to the film iman vellani portrayal of kamala khan adds youthful perspective and humor to the team atmosphere and visuals the film maintains the 90 tonality of the first captain marvel film with grunge era soundtrack that adds nostalgic touch the action sequences are well choreographed with mix of grounded and over the top moments the humor particularly from goose the cat like alien continues to be highlight conclusion the marvels successfully brings together three beloved characters creating dynamic and entertaining superhero team up however the film suffers from lack of depth in its storytelling and some narrative speed bumps despite its entertaining moments it falls short of expectations leaving fans wanting more rating 6 10 ', ' here a simple fun well made summer movie it not great by any measure nor does it ever try to be what it does have is director who understands that the source material is essentially comic book fluff none of these characters have the depth that batman or the men do but they do have cool powers and cool personalities that make for decent story and some great action set pieces the most epic of these sequences takes place in you ll never guess never not in milllion years new york city while the scene lacks originality in location it does make up for it in sheer excitement iron man goes rocketing around town in spectacular aerial battles with the chitauri who are as disposable as the foot soldiers from teenage mutant ninja turtles hawkeye sits on perch on top of building and casually snipes more chitauri out of the air with his bow and arrow the hulk well he smashes his chaotic leaping and random crushing of the puny aliens is spectacular to watch oh and few of our good guys end up battling loki at random points as well go to http thethreeacts wordpress com 2012 05 11 the avengers to read the complete review ', ' recently finish episode 1 and that classic captain marvel costume wear by laurel marsden is fire tho hope marvel will show more female superhero classic costume in future movies and series aswell and hardly recommend everyone to watch this series ', ' the marvels is comic book movie through and through and mean that in good way my favorite superhero movies are those that tell good and interesting story using drama fantasy along with some humor and the marvels hits all of those marks in fantastic way the movie stars brie larson as carol danvers captain marvel teyonah parris as monica rambeau and iman vellani as kamala khan ms marvel and the great samuel jackson as nick fury there is great chemistry between the three lead actresses and iman vellani truly shines as ms marvel brie larson is an amazing actress and she makes the penultimate and quintessential captain marvel role she was born to play teyonah parris as monica rambeau is amazing and the relationship she has with captain marvel and the issues the two bring to the movieq are well examined and form the core of this movie heart and souls samuel jackson reprises his role as nick fury every single movie that samuel jackson is in is made 10x better just because he is in it the marvels is no exception this version of nick fury is bit more fun and light hearted and is refreshing addition to the movie zawe ashton is excellent as dar benn and worthy opponent to the marvels dar benn is the kree leader who is trying to restore her homeland after civil war civil war sparked by captain marvel after she unleashed retribution for how she had been treated in the first film and how the kree unjustly treated the skrull for many years as for all good villains dar benn sparks some empathy toward her motives even though in the end those motives are destructive my only negative toward this movie is how underutilized is zenobia shroff as muneeba khan kamala mother in ms marvel zenobia shroff stole the show as kamala controlling but very loving mother we do get that here in the marvels just wanted more they say the best acting is done when you cannot tell the person is acting zenobia shroff is that type of actor she so owns this character you cannot tell she is just acting part she is delight as kamala mother and wanted to see more of her and hope we do see more of her in the future ', ' yet it another marvel movie this is just your average hollywood production with good visuals and engaging stories most people would enjoy this movie as solid popcorn entertainment brie larson acting in this movie is not the best certainly brie is wonderful actress and has done many great performances in many other films but her portrayal of captain marvel is rigid and awkward in this movie clearly they have not figured out the exact tone manner and persona they want captain marvel to have the character design of captain marvel is failure in this movie but m sure these will get better in future installments just as they did with thor overall it a solid marvel production with some typical marvel flaws ', ' very good series funny and cool the story goes very well cool visuals solid characters and easy to understand plots the lives of teenagers which are very relatable to real life conversations are made very fun and adorable there are lessons to be learned ', ' ok so this is an entertaining series with the trademark of marvel behind it it is rated 16 with the focus purely on the title character jessica jones all the way to the end maybe with their fingers crossed for fourth season she is no superhero basically all will be revealed in the series but jessica uses her powers to operate within her low budget private eye business has the series unfolds its just an endless crescendo of fighting crime and some beyond explanation instances the storylines are mixture of great with the absurd some where the law book seems to have been re written admit that the jessica jones character played by krysten ritter is great strong lead but the whole series seemed to revolve around very low budget superhero which her morals that are miss placed time and time again which fades into self righteousness the nearer the series gets to the end the jeri hogarth character played by carrie anne moss maybe her hidden powers was probably immortality and talking rubbish her ability to recover overnight from her wounds and spin out somewhat horrendous tail for the circumstances were scriptwriters crime on writing already mentioned in other reviews 16 audience absolutely sex sessions too many in context to the general audience who may have wanted to watch very low key marvel production ', ' bad and short story barely got time to get to know the new characters alot of big errors regarding the heroes powers captain marvel just teleports to where she needs to be all of sudden no didnt swap places feels like whoever wrote and directed this didnt really care that much and nobody else obviously managed to stop this from hitting the cinema am sure most focus groups would have told them this was bad really hope better marvel movies come fast before people give up on the franchise because of this movie loved the previous captain marvel movies and like brie larsson know she could have done better she cant be happy seeing this result ', ' the avengers is classic marvel movie full of action stunning special effects and the odd bit of funny humour think age of ultron will be better but this is still fun and enjoyable film love how it appeals to everyone not just comic book fans can find any flaws in this movie it kinda has everything you need in good movie action comedy cool quotes and stunning special effects also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed the casting choices were also great everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play robert downey jr is great as iron man and scarlett johannson is amazing as black widow my favourite is samuel jackson as the tough but amazing nick fury all in all watch this film ', ' really love this series this series is kind of spiritual successor of the mcu young adult series cloak and dagger runaways really hope marvel will make more series movies like this ', ' this is probably the worst marvel movie to date horrible acting and maybe m missing some but was the only person in the theater on friday night not sure how it can be making as much money as they claim but then again if it on the internet it must be true ', ' the show name itself make you excite to watch this series powerful acting by all the actors edge of seat screenplay with brilliant music and action performances the story of this series make it totally interesting to watch this 13 episodes series with thrilling screenplay we need more shows like this ', ' just love how they used american actors to play russians florence pugh accent change back and fourth was amazing ly bad she not bad actress not the best either but just couldn handle her inability to keep the accent the movie of course was not very realistic but that marvel for ya it felt like half the movie was spent in the house getting to know each other again or whatever that was feel like every marvel movie see is just the same stuff with different people my wife and were not impressed ', ' like most of the phase 4 mcu ms marvel offers new stylistic and story telling pov from character unlike we ve seen on the screen before iman and the rest of the crew are so lovable and it almost feel so real and genuine also love the dedication and effort that was taken to show the beauty of muslim americans and the rich culture they have it hard not to see how much ms marvels culture plays in her development the storytelling is very well done and while at times it may seem rushed or too slow the visuals and messages they are telling makes up for it while would prefer at least 10 episodes there nothing can do about that but overall watching the show and seeing something different thats not the same cut and dry hero vs villain troupe is refreshing and has made phase 4 and ms marvel some of the best so far can wait till season 2 ', ' this show is so freaking long and its only 13 episodes they need to to step it up it is boring af to watch random characters you seriously don care about for entire episodes you can disagree all you want but you re lying to yourself if you say your attention never wanders during this show literally started fast forwarding through every scene without action or frank and guess what can completely follow the storyline one of my favorite shows is better call saul it has more to do with american law and the action scenes are scarce but they still somehow make it interesting and keep my attention punisher is just like that but it never holds your attention unless some kind of fight is happening this is comic book adaption it should be all action yes actually read the comics know frank past and everyone else backstory is integrated into the series but there is always ton of hardcore fights not saying it a bad show but it far from perfect if you literally have no other show to watch then give this shot ', ' wow talk about millennialization the last few episodes were buildup to the most pyrrhic victory ve ever seen in the whole of the marvel netflix shows it makes me dread what we will see in the next seasons of the other shows mean how do you outdo the soul wrenching misery of the final episode short of tossing love interest into slow motion chipper shredder and watching their bloody bits spray over the main character really cant the heroes have happy ending remember those moment to bask in the glow of righteous victory before fade to black come on people the millennials aren worth pandering to please return to the days of heroes getting to win in the end without making them walk through pile of human excrement afterward ', ' could only make it to episode 3 that 3 hours of tv show about super hero that in total contained maybe 20 minutes of action that a generous estimate they spend far more talking about the main characters race and religion that cool guess if we were watching drama but that not really what want my marvel shows to be about this show is obviously geared to far younger audience than any of the other marvel series if you want something like falcon and the winter soldier hawk eye loki ect you probably won like this if you want an even more kid friendly version of hawkeye that talks lot about race and religion then you may like this ', ' tried kept my mind open but this is awful the storyline the agenda the acting can find anything that make it worthwhile disney ruined another marvel character if you want to waste hours in it go ahead ', ' whole bunch of supposedly clever dialogues more or less clich lines some funny moments and lots of pointless banters among the lead characters the character interactions are sometimes amusing and more or less remind you of buddy cop movies from the years past only set in scifi cg background disappointing and ridiculous action sequences in the same spirit as transformers in nutshell it basically an extended version of iron man captain america and thor if you liked any of these past movies chances are you ll like this one too for me there have been and will be plenty of better super hero films ', ' the action is bad but the plot is intriguing and the characters are likable at first after few episodes you start seeing dummed down sub plots childish dialogue weird character motivations and simple laziness in nearly every aspect its bad representation of drug addiction and mental health it is extremely misinformed heavy handed and predictable in every bad way the cast is good with david tennant performance being the reason to watch some episodes of the 1st season and the score is pretty great too ultimately it a waste of time and brain cells not worth watch ', ' as fan of every comic book genre and watching every comic book adaptation can say that this is one of the best and most refreshing adaptations since the underrated scott pilgrim vs world at first m quite hesitant about this series but after watching the first episode really like it the character the art style and the colorful eastern culture ', ' only the first 2 episodes are exciting it is very terrible idea to put lot of history which is not real history into show such long it is just boring ', ' it is an example of how superhero series should be made it is brutal realistic and serious you can easily attach to characters no matter that they are villains or good guys oh and villains of course they are awesome can say anything else about them because don want to spoil the show to new people characters are not black and white everyone has something that is not proud of really really recommend to everyone that haven watched it yet ', ' soooo really guys what do you expect from the movie fun checked music checked action checked likeable actors checked space colours scenery checked crazy cats checked lots of them this is good movie movie is just way to spend time and this one is good at it knew that there no iron man or doctor strange or groot but this movie doesn need them to be good go to the theatre and enjoy know that will watch it again and know that my english is not good enough but think that you understand me go to cinema and put that stars to value this movie at least 8 or 9 from me they got 10 stars they deserve it ', ' not very good loosely based on the comic character development is poorly done all these characters just meet and then get to know so much about each other in so short amount of time external information about the bad guy is learned to quickly how can you tell his habits if he has only just been introduced to you few hours ago was really looking forward to this movie heard so many good things but it was total bust anddd the amount of info known about the hulk before they even meet is lot like the security guard when he falls down this is prefect for comic but bad movie adaptation more time would be needed for the development and information to make sense accordingly ', ' m not quite sure what they were trying to accomplish here the movie started as classic advengers marvel action movie then it wanted to move to the funny side as thor movie to end up as the typical villain movie where the bad guy explains his plan so our hero can ruin world domination do not know where they are trying to go with this they spent the correct amount of money to create an action flick that will entertain you but at no point this is good movie or something that you should recommend someone to see my opinion in few words if you have nothing better to do watch it while doing something else ps loved the mission impossible mask thin solution it os ridiculous when they do it it is offensive when you see it somewhere else ', ' people who are aware of previous marvel movies about black widow abilities going to find this movie utter nonsense for example 1st scene that turned me off red guardian first lifting the bulk to clear out way for aeroplane showed his strength cheesy way but in next scene when he lifts his wife it feels that he finds her heavy as normal fellow and other characters also can do anything story demands even if that is not in their expertise or abilities ', ' so saw few episodes and they all so much running even any basic discussions everyone is always in hurry constant drama fights something threatening everyone future it like they know if they slow down it gets boring they also have to sound smart the story kinda makes sense it just everyone bossing around and being impatient with everyone it literally feels like the actors were forced to hurry because they was paid by seconds the makeup is okay but think it could be way better any talented make up artist can pull this off the special effects doesn that bad still feels kinda low budget most of the inside sets can be shooten anywhere it just feel like being in hotel room or in the bar on the corner old storage unit giant hardware store but not in space don think that the actors and actresses ar bad think it just written poorly in hurry it pretty much basic crimi series with sci fi mixed to make it more interesting nerd friendly and also to be able to glue the marvel logo on have no hate for sci fi or crimi if it well done this isn ', ' this movie was everything expected from no superpowered hero jason bourne films style finally mcu gave scarlett johansson the opportunity to show her acting skills by the way florence pugh was awesome she will be great black widow david harbour and rachel weisz have great chemistry in this movie and all together was great cast people giving hard criticism probably dc fans they love boycotting mcu ', ' was little apprehensive of daredevil series before unlike arrow and flash daredevil was little less captivating as comic book here for me afterall daredevil hadn got his power because of nuclear reaction genetic make up nor he was filthy rich playboy then watched 5 minutes of the pilot episode and couldn move an eyelid till saw the final one it is beautifully written the cast is amazing and everything falls perfectly into place what love the most is the fact that marvel has put every details into making matthew story very real he comes across more convincing vigilante than others present on the scene the fact that he gets suit in 13th episode shows that true vigilantes are not just born out of the engineering room ', ' it was painful to sit through each episode individually am huge marvel fan but this just didn hit the target it was only 6 episodes long and yet it felt so long and boring that have no other words to say about it im not saying its horrible but it just didn bring anything to the phase 4 table its plot is pointless and feels too forced writing is mediocre at best and if it wasn marvel title wouldn even think twice about watching it it a fun watch but really wouldn feel like im missing out on anything even if skipped it ', ' way too slow hard to tell its marvel show most of the time more cultural documentary so unless like wandavision the end is worth the slow beginning then it really not for me ', ' season 1 was fantastic and refreshing season 2 is dull bore realized maybe the only character liked was killgrave ', ' another mcu miniseries that doesn go anywhere they just introduce characters and other things that no one knew about until now even if the target audience is not me gave it try and it a no from my side ms marvel is ok but that doesn say much the actress does good job but the others are pretty bad in any case the series is lower budget than the others in the mcu this can be seen from the effects to the set pieces the story is predictable and unoriginal can even say boring the villains are almost non existent the action is mediocre and the dialogue is very cringe for kids it definitely good one but can overlook the fact that it looks more like disney channel series than marvel one ', ' daredevil is the quintessential marvel superhero by far the rest mean the iron man captain america the avengers are just ways to make shine and hyper advertise marvel to teenagers and young adults into spending their money on bgrade marvel heroes daredevil is the real deal the character the story the plot everything is sublime and beautiful thoroughly worth enjoying every moment more importantly the whole thing has heart something that the avengers lack altogether therefore it is the best yes its brutal violent gore even but that was how deadpool was advertised and frankly deadpool was bit disappointing this though is very satisfying right till the end ps second season is way more fun than the first ', ' except for the 1st season of daredevil and the punisher marvel trails far behind dc these series are getting worse and can watch anymore find another show unless you don mind boring cheesy tv ', ' watched the movie for watching black widows stylish fighting but there not was big and good fighting scene she fight only one minute with the main villain also others fighting was slow paced ', ' am currently up to date on all mcu projects and have revisited this movie as only watched it on its release and after endgame thought nothing much of it now after many lack lustre mcu projects this one shines among the top of phase 4 used to give it 5 out of 10 but honestly looking at what the film achieved think it deserves 7 there are many flaws in this movie but also many positives look at it as spy movie and that how ve viewed it and enjoyed it florence and scarlet definitely steal the show and david harbor is also good act have issue with the villain and cg but don think that enough to knock it so low would have liked this movie more think if it came out back in phase 2 3 but give it another watch and after the messes of she hulk and thor 4 appreciate the serious tone it had and balance of comedy you mighty also be pleasantly surprised ', ' good movie few scenes are boring in this picture this movie is not important for mcu you can skip it but recommend you to watch it in 1 25x or 1 50x ', ' well produced didn fall into the recent releases that looked rushed to complete because of covid storyline was great but the build up lack there of was non existent on the villain not enough friction throughout the movie loved the family aspect enjoy ', ' the first season is fascinating great story great characters great acting matt character is complex and inspiring while his antagonist wilson fisk is beyond brilliant the downsides are 1 the acting of the karen paige character whom takes up big chunk of space in the show and adds absolutely nothing 2 the extensive side stories all meaningless story lines that add nothing to the main story 3 the fights beyond ridiculous one doesn need to be martial artist to understand that the back flips are retarded the second season is mediocre at best just bunch of ninja fights within the plot of blue sky thing which is of overpowering importance yet barely explained at all ', ' have never watched something so slow boring ridiculous and full of meaningless philosophy and cliches as the season 3 of daredevil was if the shows ratings don plummet after this monstrosity we ll know for sure that we live in world of idiots season 1 and 2 were fine but season 3 is almost unwatchable gave it up many times but decided to follow through because thought maybe something exciting will come up now and then two episodes later maybe now this made me watch the season its in entirety in multiple attempts acting is good but cliches are unbearable and one thing that american tv and movies love doing is humanzing the villians giving their stories spin showing them as people with mental issues and troubled pasts as long as you have that background it is ok to kill people daredevil is full of that too ', ' have just watched the first episode so can speak for rest of series or don know the source material but it felt like mediocre episode of archer does not lean into the ridiculousness enough the fight scenes seem fun though also don know how this eluded me for so long being marvel hulu needs to expand outside of america ', ' people are giving bad reviews because it is the origin of muslim superhero and she is from pakistan the first episode is good it can be relatable to young teenagers am not muslim and not from pakistan why am saying this because some people this am muslim that why am supporting this show ', ' really enjoyed the first hour of this movie it was full of action and like almost anything scarlett johansson is in she always portrays the black widow brilliantly and that was what it was like the first hour unfortunately the second half of the movie it did start to drag and did become boring at times until the ending did think the antagonists of the movie were forgettable and that taskmaster was portrayed poorly and do think they wasted such an interesting character on mute do however think this movie gets more hate than it needs and it is quite enjoyable for certain parts of the movie ', ' this is the story that we wanted thank you natasha romanoff we will miss you ', ' ve been watching lot of marvel films lately and there been some that ve enjoyed and some less finally decided to watch black widow and was kind of disappointed mean this film is aggressively average there nothing groundbreaking about this and found it difficult to finish it just typical spy movie so if your planning to watch this don go in with high expectations and also was so shocked that this just came out in 2021 because knew there was black widow movie but thought it had been made at least decade ago why make it now either way wouldn recommend this film it just average ', ' with few crossovers already and many many rumored to follow marvel agents of h e d is one of the most important titles in the marvel universe with many explanations and reveals relating to the marvel universe it is pretty much necessity to understand most marvel movies released after 2014 including avengers age of ultron captain america the winter soldier and others now with the interesting mixture of action drama adventure sci fi and romance agent of h e d provides marvel fans with weekly dose of entertainment as well as information about the marvel characters would highly recommend watching it ', ' couldn wait to see th avengers thought that it would be on the same level as the iron man movies thor and captain america sadly its more on par with the two hulk movies instead have to admit that am fan of superheroes but really wasn into the avengers as the cartoons contains too many whiny characters well the movie is no different there is too much preaching by nick fury captain america is too angry angrier than the hulk in fact way too much tony stark and too much exposition about science that we really don care about the only characters that really shine on screen are black widow wonderful kick ass fight screens woman with power without superpowers hawkeye thor loki until he starts getting boring and agent colson joss whedon usually knows how to temper his characters better but in this movie he really put together some awful dialog yes some of the jokes were funny but in between there were long periods of just boring stuff it too bad know this will make lot of money but it could have been so much better it could have been real classic but instead its not worth viewing more than once ', ' season 1 was fine until you see how season 2 is gonna be more of the same slow eye to eye soapy you don know what you re doing never ending scolding of daredevil by their friends like he is child which gets old and obnoxious really fast seriously on every episode they didn know what to fill their script with the and how to stretch season 2 script to make it to the 40 minute episode mark with engaging and thrilling content instead they kept going in circles with it which is what these types shows tend to do some of the fights are sloppy and boy oh boy don i get tired of saying it but how hate when they make well established superheroes weaker than they re supposed to be just because they can keep it up so they tone down their powers and abilities like there no way it takes daredevil more than 1 punch to knock non superpowered person down and to evade punches like how many times is he gonna get beat up near death ', ' wasn that into the first couple of episodes but it definitely got less frenetic and more interesting just wish we could all see some genuine user reviews feel like the anti woke crowd will just completely trash everything in disingenuous way best way to tell is if review contains wanted to like this or loved insert movie with non white or female lead here but continues to leave rating under 4 for something that obviously isn on that level audible sigh ', ' really don know how to relate this properly think mostly because don understand what kind of film was meant to be know that the marvel universe has comedic moments and has failed with them looking at you thor t but at least they had some story behind them this whole was lack of substance and comedy for the hell of it personally think this whole endeavour was waste of time and money by the studio did they not look at how interested people were in miss marvel and monica rambeau from the shows everything about this felt bit on par with the second or third spy kids films ', ' reviews it has no relationship with the mcu but is light hearted and fun to watch from the story point of view you can skip it but from the entertainment point of view then you should watch it ', ' not bad not great just meh florence does an excellent job though she deserves to have an stand alone movie ', ' it is intense it is violent its blood everywhere vividly captured perfectly written and acted at an exceptional level where you literally see the actors merged with the characters jon jon jon jonny bernthal dude you killed it you gave frank castle the body straight outta comics stand ovation is in order don think there ever was or ever will be version of the punisher that can reflect the complexity of his personality his pain his grief him being the most violent soldier one can ever imagine and also the very human he is at the bottom of his heart the way you did thank you jon unlike most other cold feet ed stereotypical superheros frank castle is one of those very numbered ones that make you say thank god he took down that son of b this was sure worth the 2 year long wait thank you marvel thank you netflix one batch two batch penny and dime ladies and gentlemen the one and only the punisher is finally here ', ' this movie is just another one of marvel ploys to get money after pushing out mess of films forced to tie in with this once you get 2 hour generic plot with characters who have generic back stories and abilities and are forced to work together and undoubtedly come together as one it is not an original plot or even creative fail to see how long scenes of fighting with the camera cutting back and forth is entertaining if you actually truly like this movie please go see doctor can wait to see how the second film turns out marvel makes money purely being marvel not because their films are outstanding and groundbreaking they all have generic plot and generic heroes we need god to save us ', ' yelena managed to make her way into the list of favourite characters within single movie alexei was hilarious natasha on the other hand felt kind of boring the number one thing didn like about the movie though is taskmaster feel like they completely got rid of the charm taskmaster has always had feel like it was complete waste of great character over year later m gonna lower my score to like 5 5 10 yelena was really the only redeeming quality of this movie nat felt like side character in her own movie ', ' great actors great director but it just seemed like they didn work one thing love about black widow in other films has been the wide camera fight scenes where you can see scarlett has trained hard and learnt the moves and they look epic it appears the director forgot scarlett is insanely talented and went for the cheap cut scenes in every single fight sequence honestly it just really felt the whole way through that the director knew nothing about modern action movies and was trying to make gone with the black widow and prejudice black widow deserved more ', ' so love the marvel series few hiccups in some of the previous movies but this is muddled mess no storyline just confusing from start to finish such shame that marvel are really struggling to find storylines and yet they just keep producing and churning out absolute rubbish please understand marvel is an amazing franchise and have treated us all with some great movies but please guys if you can give us that wow factor then just stop please spoil us with the magic we all know you can make but until you find that real next marvel magic please stop destroying the already amazing legacy you have given us the marvel fans ', ' something should have told me with all the delays it was going to be bad movie clearly the worst installment in the mcu to think waited all this time for this ', ' outstanding simply outstanding this show is like love letter to the fans of the comic book and complete and utter redemption for that ben affleck train wreck of film that we the die hard daredevil fans were forced to endure couldn be happier nor more surprised the show is dark and edgy pitting our beloved hero against grim unforgiving vision of new york city it is simply light years ahead of anything ve come to expect rather unfortunately from the majority of marvel movie or tv adaptations my sincerest thanks and kudos to all those involved total home run you have to be blind not to see how great this show is and to anyone who gave this show anything less than an 8 or 9 it clear you re not true fan of the comic k m done gushing now ', ' just finished watching daredevil on netflix what can you say top acting by all including charlie cox and deborah ann woll but special praise goes to vincent onofrio for his portrayal of wilson fisk its not very often villain is played as well as this in my view up there with heath ledger the back story of daredevil and his learning curve into turning into the character is fantastic and not one episode is let down the current golden age of marvel and dc series is joy to behold and with the advent of all the new films coming out the time is now to be into superheroes well done to all on the show gritty and realistic ', ' really this is the reason why m more into dc the whole movie just feels forced just one encounter with the villain rubbish backstory if there was one and almost no character development it just film for kids really very immature maybe dc doesn have its universe as good on point as marvel but at least the villains give thrill the backstories are actually there and everything feels more mature overall sorry marvel but you lost me on this one ', ' taking place first in her preteen life and then between civil war and infinity war with some other flash backs in between the film tries to fill in some plot holes for those time periods the other films haven while seeming to set up natashas replacement given we know her fate in endgame compared to other mcu films this is lot more hand to hand as befitting the widows way of fighting iron man presses button and the bad guys fall down here it more like series of dance moves showing off their amazing training and there are some well choreographed interactions it sadly doesn pull off the same level of comedy as ragnarok red guardian is just buffoon in comparison to korg and co while natashas fixer seems to spend much of his screen time asleep but it has some good lines that keeps it moving along at good speed prequels are tricky for series character you can explore extra details to their lives such as natasha talking bit more about her history with clint but ultimately they have to end in situation that links to something that been filmed before you can have character die in prequel when you know they re alive in previous film that takes place later in the characters timeline unless the future character is actually clone or has some other subtle change made to them this does seem to reduce the risk to life here yelena is listed in the hawkeye series though in what capacity this widow will take is still to be decided ', ' season 1 was my favorite tv show ever season 3 is up there good writing my favorite hero kingpin acting is right up there with the joker performance in the dark knight and the storytelling and character development mean uuaauu the fact that we already have 3 seasons does not bring any negative feedback to this show or any wear hope it continues for long time because this is standalone gem that can keep up long after any luke cage or iron fist please don cancel it because this is the tv show ', ' ok know 10 10 scores are thrown in too lightly ow days but hear me out this movie is truly astonishing following the storyline directly from thor 2011 this movie starts strong with loki trying to conquer earth from there its just wild ride it grips on you and you won be able to catch your breath until way after the credits the thing that appreciate the most is that its true superhero movie often in comics adaptations the directors try to ground the actions and powers worried they can not match the scope of the comic book medium well not here the action is unbelievable the feats of strength breathtaking ironman shoots its repulsor beams thor uses his lightning strike lastly it wouldn have worked without the humor wheedon has perfect chops each time his punchlines will take you off guard and trust me laugh you will watched this in really packed theater the function was sold out one week before record in my country everyone was cheering laughing clapping and wowing truly special spectacle really ing amazing ', ' m long time fan of marvel comics and the mcu was all young me dreams come true understand that after endgame they need to explore new directions to avoid more of the same so even if they end up with diverse products that don necessarily have me as the target audience would still expect them to be of certain caliber for example did watch the ms marvel show and though not my cup of tea still managed to enjoy it for what it is as new character intro unfortunately the marvels is just objectively not good with some moments that are downright cringe don they audience test these things anymore don think you will miss anything important in the overall mcu narrative if you skip this one so no need to waste your time on it ', ' one of the lucky few to watch the film early premiered here in nairobi yesterday 27th of april didn think it could be pulled off with all the characters in play but marvel did great one on this iron man hulk captain america thor black widow hawk eye and loki playing the villain number of very good match ups between the heroes cool stuff story line was good each hero had considerable screen time loki plays the villain role very well and all the characters came good watching it again this weekend its gonna break bank ', ' nothing exciting poor superpowers and poorly crafted much work should have been needed around the story definitely not watching second season if anybody thinks of making so ', ' solid movie cg was little drab in places but it pretty great ', ' season 1 is really good but season 2 gets lost in trying to figure out who the bad guys are doesn mean it isn worth watching but you get spoiled by season 1 fwiw the episodes can get pretty gruesome in fact they can get as gruesome as anything on tv can be so be warned really enjoyed the acting especially in season 1 ', ' if you love sci fi adventure shows you wont find them much better than this there is so much going on all the time never dull moment the acting is also great and especially the first season has great humour also like how the show follows alongside the events of the mcu movies my biggest downside was losing bobbi and hunter only to keep the insufferable mack in the general line up that guy is about as annoying as they get generally can stand self righteous sanctimonious people and he is the very definition of that ', ' cheesy sitcom meets spy kids what happened to super hero movies where you can empathize with the hero situation understand the impossible decisions they have to make when everything is on the line watching this movie was no more exciting than watching the evening news this movie stunningly failed at the clever humour of its predecessors the choreography of the fight scenes was lacklustre and what was with the disney singalong it hard to accept that movie series that had me counting down the days to new release has now made me dread the warped characters stories once loved ', ' now this right here is peak marvel or should say marvellous the show is fantastic would recommend everyone to watch they did justice to all the characters in the show plus m in love with iman vellani acting so fluid and splendid you go girl show em what you re made of ', ' captain marvel fits excellently into the already expansive mcu and will leave you desperate for more brie charms as captain marvel and looks set to lead the charge as marvel continue to obliterate all competition in the superhero market ', ' growing up on the 2003 daredevil film the character matt murdock is very familiar one always found benaffleck as great actor to play the character so seeing this netflix series cast completely new actor was intrigued at what he could bring to the character that affleck didn and lemme tell ya perfect casting charlie cox imbeds the character playing much more grounded complex matt murdock seriously ben affleck couldn even outdo cox emotional battle he has in what he doing the show is near perfect as evidently shown as soon as season 1 but to really watch this show as it was intended you must intertwine the other defenders marvel shows in the correct order for people who don know watch each season by release date yes it a lot but totally worth watching in order to get the greatest experience of not just daredevil but all of these great characters and storylines forewarning might be spoilers season 1 love this grounded reality we have here in the mcu in hells kitchen we have an entire city alive at night crimes of all kinds are brewing here and blind lawyer named matt murdock who has these abnormal abilities that makes him look at his surroundings using an echolocation type process is fed up with it while we get this story unfolding of this city being bought off by rich philanthropist wilson fisk we also get deep character stories first starting off with matt murdock and following with another named fisk played by the great vincent ofrino here we see man not only blinded by his ill intended promise to make the city better but also vulnerable because of his new love interest and his mother which is important part of his life as flashbacks will show you now in 13 episodes we don only get these characters we also get many others like foggy nelson as murdocks business partner friend deborah ann woll as the business partner who brings this conspiracy to their knowledge scott glenn as matt murdocks old mentor stick rosario dawson as nurse named claire that is the first to find out the masked man murdock real identity and lastly bob gunton as fisk right hand man wesley which found to be really great character but was sadly ended too early imo there many other characters that bring depth to this show but won list them as the list is already long enough just think this was probably one of the best seasons of television that lays out this comic perfectly one of the better mcu properties ve seen yet season 2 upted the ante to 100 this time in hells kitchen we got vigilante on the loose taking out warehouses full of irish mobsters and whatnot detective daredevil is on the case seriously though probably 4 or so years ago really got into these mcu netflix shows remember rewatching daredevil season 1 around 3 different times loving it more and more each time and remember watching jessica jones season 1 which was nice change of pace for this gritty hell kitchen but remember sitting down watching this season for the first time and remember being absolutely astounded and now coming back all of these years later revisiting and reviewing this season of daredevil is particular has me feeling so freaking hype where do even begin first off the punisher is the perfect pairing for this show making this one of the most violent seasons of any mcu show film as of 2021 pitting pairing both of these vigilantes develops juxtaposition both ideologies they hold one believes justice through the court system while the other believes killing is the only way to stop them for good the graveyard scene in particular was such an emotional scene perfectly acted by jon berthal develops picture of what emotional trauma he going through what great origin for the punisher now don let me forget about elektra omfg can overstate enough how much better casted developed this character was compared to jennifer garners incarnation the flashbacks of her and murdock meeeting for the first time and eventually to where she leads him to his fathers killer was bit unexpected but this showed the kind of relationship they both shared one that doesn mind killing and the other against it in present time we see both murdock and nachios infiltrate roxxon corporation to try and stop the corruption the yakuza have done it also revealed she is the black sky supposed mystical being the hand worships which wasn familiar with at all yeah t gets real in this but of course not as real as her ultimate demise in the end by nobu or is it then we have the return of stick who reveals to murdock about the hand and how he the leader of the chaste group of warriors who try and stop the hand from unleashing it ultimate weapon while also mentioning that elektra is part of this chaste showing by flashbacks of him training her when she was young keeping it from her that she actually dangerous weapon the hand wants all this time another big baller in this season was of course the big and bad that is vincent ofreinos kingpin it gets us up to speed from what happened after season 1 showing him garner respect from fellow inmates and guards until he basically owns the place of course he recruits punisher while he at it so there sure is bloodshed to be had but what was really special with kingpin this season was the scene with him and matt murdock in the prison one of the best scenes in the show so far with some hefty promises made that nelson and murdock will feel fisks wrath once he out of prison going about some side characters character that returns from dds1 and even jessica jones season 1 is brett mahoney the deputy who was bribed with cigars from nelson this time becoming detective for turning in the punisher like this relationship he and daredevil share reminds me of the batman gordon relationship little bit another side character that returns in nobu except the dude is now dead yet alive so t is complicated sweet little cameo from hogarth from jessica jones pops up with nelson working for her firm now and finally of course claire makes her return with her dealing with murderous ninjas and quitting her job att the corrupt hospital she works for this season was definitely game changer for the lawyer trip tho as the team breaks up we re left to wonder if they ll ever reconcile again such complex season of television and lemme tell ya one of my favorite seasons of television ve seen yet cannot wait to watch the defenders season 3 of this show but with all of these other netflix marvel shows it might be second season 3 so after about year or 2 ve finally gotten around to finishing season 3 of this show after small hiatus while won be as descriptive in this season review still think it one of the best the mcu has with this season taking place after the defenders miniseries we see damaged and inflicted matt murdock who is now suffering from injuries relating to his hearing this season almost seemed like it wanted murdock to go back to square one again with him basically retiring his red devil suit and going back to the original black outfit he wore in season 1 with this season we see fisk make deal with federal agents so he can be released out of prison in doing so we get introduced to new character that becomes very important character throughout the season dex poindexter he a damaged man and fisk brings him under his wing as one of his fbi henchmen occasionally dressing up as daredevil to kill cause crime to discredit the daredevil alias the season also expertly continues vanessa fisks story revealing she isn as innocent as she may seem think my favorite part of the show was showing nadeem fbi agent that is forced into this crime conspiracy and the conflicts he had with becoming dirty cop his entire arc was nerve wracking and albeit sad rounded out amazingly of course all the recurring characters such as foggy and karen are integral to this season too with karen even becoming huge asset to the plot this season definitely concludes amazingly well but obviously from the cliffhangers some of these characters were just getting started in all this show is probably my favorite superhero show and definitely one of my favorites in general the gritty expertly crafted world that shown in this show was top tier comic book material that any fan of the genre should check out the characters all matter to the story the plot lines are seriously so good and of course charlie cox portrayal of matt murdock daredevil is some of the best casting ve ever seen 100 recommend this ', ' not marvel fan but really enjoyed this hopefully season 2 does not drop off like so many other shows lately ', ' if you ve been keeping tabs on the mcu latest brace yourself for wild ride and not entirely in the good sense picture this movie that feels like it battling an identity crisis trying to merge four different films into one that the vibe got from this sequel that honestly should ve just stayed as an idea in the production room it as if they gambled on what direction to take and ended up lost in space with multiple delays and bloated budget you expect smoother flight right kamala bless her shines through the tangled mess rising above script that did her no favors she the mvp in game where the rules are all over the place the action sequences flip flop between oh cool and wait what am watching testament to production that seen better days the movie like that one joke that falls flat in quiet room every character trying to be the funny one and it crickets all around even with the post credits scene it more of meh than wow and don get me started on the cgi it so glaring it practically another character we ve got brie larson who seems more at ease in her superhero gear but even she can salvage this ship nick fury turned into punchline and the villain so forgettable m already asking who was it again but the real razzie worthy moment scene that a low budget homage to the wizard of oz it like the movie problems got their own featurette and that cat scene let just say it a whole song and dance that nobody asked for in short this one a tough sell even for the die hards it a bit of heartache to see the mcu hit this note especially when we know the symphony they re capable of here to hoping the next one finds its way back to the magic we know and love ', ' the origin story of carol danvers otherwise known as captain marvel found this movie quite enjoyable for the humour spectacle and character moments the plot involves the title character origin which is reasonably good but quite exposition heavy at times this is told within the context of kree skrull conflict and the origins of the avengers initiative it all works fairly well but feels slightly overlong with certain aspects seemingly bit rushed to make room for everything it all adds up to lot of screen time for what is essentially popcorn flick there are plenty of good points all the character focus on danvers nick fury and the rambeau family works pretty well brie larson looks and acts the part of great superhero she makes danvers likeable main protagonist and has solid chemistry with the likes of akira akbar lashana lynch and samuel jackson jackson has one of his biggest roles in an mcu movie and is as entertaining as ever if you take marvel too seriously you might be disappointed by the level of humour in this portrayal of nick fury but enjoyed it the kree and skrull characters are reasonably good and their inclusion builds more worlds within the marvel cinematic universe ben mendleson and jude law are both good in their respective roles the 1990s cultural and technological references are great fun and for forty something like me this is probably the best aspect of the film some of the musical choices are bit obvious but if you like bit of nostalgia it does it fantastically well as you would imagine female characters are portrayed strongly and there is an obvious theme of empowerment running through the movie this feels like it pitched at the younger female audience members particularly in the fight sequences childhood flashbacks and the scenes that make use of popular music to make them cooler in this sense think there is bit more style than substance however it had the desired effect on my 6 year old daughter who was suitably blown away by danvers powers and then said she is her favourite superhero visually it is as colourful and impressive as you would expect from marvel with creature effects space battles alien worlds and superhero spectacle the fight scenes in particular are very well done some using the shapeshifting characters to comical effect it is quite an important movie to see before avengers endgame and the wandavision television show due to the characters that are introduced so would recommend watching for mcu continuity ', ' the graphics of the movie are amazing it includes many awesome scenes such as fighting immense action scenes transforming of tony stark and hulk other themes of the movie are the attitude of tony huge star cast action packed scenes and many more on the whole you get the pleasure of watching nice movie and the time just passes by when you watch this movie but the starting of the movie is somewhat dragging when the characters come into play one by one the movie gets interesting it also has some comedy scenes it is the first movie to have more than 3 marvel characters if you are lover of visual effects you must definitely watch this movie ', ' love black widow was upset that they decided to do thor 2 before black widow then wondered why do ant man 1 and 2 before bw then captain marvel then realized they were going to waste the first female avenger with prequel and knew it would not be an endgame but was at least hoping for decent stand alone movie but it fails the characters are boring with minimal chemistry the main villain isn it much it is generic plot and it is hard to care about because bw was killed off never to return the only thing it did watch give us new black widow that while carrying the mantle of kgb femme fatal doesn have the poise or grace of her predecessor ', ' the series was really crazy and brutal lol jon bernthal did frank castle an incredible job playing role as sociopath with no remorse and no compassion for his enemies he portrayed his role very well very good acting ', ' m gonna keep this short as many people here have already posted how bad this movie was written how miscast brie larson is etcetera for me this was the first movie ever where thoroughly thought about walking out of the theater fear deeply for phase 4 ', ' love marvel but quite frankly by 2nd episode was bored by the violence the lack of any back stories character building and the unbelievable storyline go and watch something else instead something like better call saul or breaking bad ', ' m really impressed by how creative it is and the inspiration taken from spider verse being pakistani d say the resemblance to our culture is quite accurate yes of course since the character being born and raised in america not pakistan so it definitely makes sense for her not to be like that 100 typical pakistani but as an pakistani american it very accurate the only nitpick is with the urdu they sometimes used was like yeah that not how we speak but it not used much so not really big deal ', ' finally got around to watching this and remained with it until the end really wish could get that time back can help but feel as though this character and this series we re created to capitalise on the msheu movement feels as though this show was made for children but was also trying to garner the attention of young adults as well particularly gen as result it a bit of mess and doesn quite settle but bounces between playing to both audiences and not flowing well at all the cgi script and acting are all pretty poor seems to be thing with marvel these days even my children called it cringy wouldn be so bad if the show was engaging and could maintain it plot marvel projects have been nosey diving for while now and this is no exception save yourselves some pain and precious time and avoid ', ' this is typical pointless disney film disguised as marvel mini series where nobody dies there are no real villians the bad guys just escape in the end its just filled with clich and plotholes the acting is average music was little better but irrelevant at some points the first few episodes felt somewhat okay but as it progressed it feels not worth putting in the time and think atleast 70 of the people who watched the climax must have said this is it ', ' tbh don understand all the hatorade thought this was an enjoyable movie with lot of great action didn find the movie to be slow at all you have to suspend belief for any super hero movie and this is no different natasha is bad but she still has heart thus her sacrifice in endgame plus we all know that families real or contrived have their own dynamics that bring up lots of baggage also enjoyed rachel weiss in her role find it to be another solid entry in the mcu the best no entertaining absolutely ', ' fight and comedy on point you will love fight scene ', ' at first it was interesting to see jessica jones character different from other super heroes however the character seems to learn and accept nothing throughout the time pretty sure the writers intended for her to be below average incompetent nobody with super strength but this is like watching spongebob with massive power and didn nothing besides messing things up all the time kinda boring aka wasting time ', ' an interesting and spectacular show that does not disappoint daredevil is one of the more interesting characters and what makes him interesting is his complexity and layers he is driven by the desire for justice and sincerely wants to help others and he is driven not by the desire for revenge but by his convictions and faith the series is really great the characters are fully developed and the action is spectacular and believable as much as it is possible in the superhero genre for me personally maybe the second season is the best in which the punisher joins who was excellently embodied by jon bernthal he kind of daredevil opposite and yet they find themselves on the same side the punisher is driven by the desire for revenge while daredevil is driven by the desire for justice the characters are excellent and the casting is almost perfect fairly faithful adaptation of the comics they managed to transfer that spirit to the screen vincent onofrio is great as wilson fisk an interesting and complex villain the action scenes are excellently directed and the whole series is real visual spectacle what makes this series great and bit different from others is precisely that combination of drama and action and the fact that the action is different from the usual pg 13 action that we are used to seeing in similar shows and movies the action here is brutal and gory and fits perfectly with the overall tone of the series an excellent screen adaptation that is definitely worth watching ', ' very boring uninspired heroes villains the premise is awesome has compelling mystery some very strong moments but loses steam as it progresses the easter eggs are unnatural the plot seems bland lazy very boring uninspired heroes villains the premise is awesome has compelling mystery some very strong moments but loses steam as it progresses the easter eggs are unnatural the plot seems bland lazy very boring uninspired heroes villains the premise is awesome has compelling mystery some very strong moments but loses steam as it progresses the easter eggs are unnatural the plot seems bland lazy ', ' almost fell asleep watching this action movie can believe had to wait so long to watch this movie ', ' this movie is so good with characters all of the family characters are so themselves seeing them adapt throughout the story is just chefs kiss the sisters dont have mushy goodbye because they wouldnt do that there were some cuts that felt not great and the plot was good sometimes and okay sometimes but it was enjoyable ', ' just big fat no absolutely no don do this again nothing interesting nothing good there isn anything in it that was gonna be fabulous the rest will also be like this who knows what else ', ' marvel legends always offers viewers brief summary of various characters per episode this is good because the majority of people probably don know where disney marvel is going with their mcu phase 4 at the end of each episode there is reference to what you should watch to find out what happens next myself find the content of mcu phase 4 so far plan and aimless it seems to me that disney focus is primarily on politically correct representation of current issues less on the entertainment of the viewer so if you want to get into mcu phase 4 you should watch marvel legens to get started everyone else should wait until phase 5 which will hopefully offer more entertainment again ', ' ok get it feminist and minority propaganda in movies are the new marvel initiative but the casting in this movie wasn the best there better female actors out there that could ve done much better job the movie gets really slow toward the middle at which point fell asleep in the theater marvel movies used to be exciting but lately they ve been more political than anything other than the best parts toward the end the movie dragged on and didn really capture my attention like the older marvel movies ', ' enjoyed this series one was winner two dipped bit and 3 brought everything together and finished nicely it was satisfying conclusion to the series and the audience was left feeling content jessica character was played very well and so was trish the storyline throughout was well written although the second series was bit of let down after such strong first season the third season redeemed the show and was riveting watching love the pi solving crimes genre and the super powers did not detract from that but rather highlighted it it is not light and breezy like other similar shows but rather darker with little comedy apart from the sardonic wit of jessica herself maybe it is one you either love or hate not sure not one for the kiddies or people who want light airy fairy stuff but it is to the taste of people who enjoy the serious and some depth in their viewing the setting is sombre as well with not many bright colours used so may be little depressing to some people who prefer comedies and colour on their screens it is multi dimensional so allows for some thinking and reflection if you agree with my description then it is one you will enjoy or at least be drawn to and watch all three series ', ' loved the show but dont like he is being beaten by dex ', ' not good show boring childish bad writing bad acting everyone wants to give it praise for diverse cast makes sense but the show is painful to watch ', ' dont get it why the hatred if this is about the hatred towards certain belief or group you guys sucks mean it if you have nothing nice to post then better to stay still ', ' kamala khan iman vellani is muslim teenage girl in jersey city new jersey her mcu idol is captain marvel she and her best friend bruno are eager to attend avengerscon and enter the costume competition her protective loving parents do not approve she sneaks out and brings along family bracelet which shockingly gives her superpower iman vellani is pakistani canadian newcomer like her and she has great feeling of new fandom energy the show brings sense of new energy this is mcu trying some indie work within their vast globe dominating entertainment enterprise it a six episode limited series this could go on if they want but the character seems to be headed for captain marvel big screen movie enjoy this character ', ' this was no marvel movie after such long wait we get ff type movie it started off well the intro was good and then it just turned into an orgy of superhero fighting but with no superheroes you gotta do better the red guardian was ok had some laughs at least ', ' between massive advertising blitz and some none too subtle hints that marvel has been dropping in their films for the last four years joss whedon avengers adaptation is one of the most eagerly anticipated blockbusters in recent memory with most of marvel flagship characters played by some of hollywood biggest stars assembled together in big budget production co written and directed by the man responsible for buffy and firefly the premise alone is enough to make fanboys swoon this is project with some very high expectations to meet and having seen it for one would say that it has met them it would not be much of stretch to say that the avengers is what every summer blockbuster wants to be given few hundred million dollars and near total creative control what director wouldn want to make film like this in its two and half hour running time it delivers coherent storyline several likable well developed protagonists and enough action and explosions to show up michal bay mention this notorious director because his transformers films particularly the latter entries have made millions on the idea that brainless fight scenes gratuitous pyrotechnics and more than little a are all it takes to make an action movie no acting writing wit or originality needed but avengers shows that that not true like certain other superhero franchise due to release its final installment later this summer avengers works as much because of its human drama as its action and special effects one of the main reasons the fantastic four movies didn work aside from weak screenplays and wooden acting was that we never bought the idea that the actors on screen were team in the first film they utterly lacked the kind of chemistry that would be expected of friends and co workers in the second entry the chemistry was so forced that they seemed like sitcom family avengers suffers from neither of these problems chris evens chris hemsworth robert downy junior scarlett johansen samuel jackson and mark ruffalo not only shine on their own but also work seamlessly together as part of team playing of each other strengths and personalities between stark cynicism casual arrogance and roguish charm cap loyalty and earnestness banner demur unobtrusive nerdiness and thor zeal and new found humility all of the leads get the chance to establish themselves as well rounded characters and to remind us why we liked them in the first place and like real team the characters don always get along from the moment they first meet they keep secrets they question each others motivations and commitments they get on each others nerves and they certainly let their egos clash in fact some of the best fight scenes are between the heroes but like real people they put aside their differences and their egos they learn to trust each other and work together in way not nearly as sappy or clich as it suddenly sounds when m writing it the casting of samuel jackson as nick fury continues to seem like better and better idea all the time he might not be able to go all out what with this being pg 13 production but there were moments that for me at least very much invoked fond memories of pulp fiction tom hiddleston also does very good work as the villainous loki his air of condescension and supreme self confidence makes him instantly loathable and the hint of jealousy and subtle desperation in his voice together with his piercing wide eyed stare gives the unmistakable impression that something is definitely not right inside his head watching the heroes give him the beating he deserves is supremely satisfying experience and like said the action is great too the numerous fights and shootouts are excellently choreographed and filmed and the climactic alien invasion is stunning in its size and complexity it like non sucky battlefield la and the cost must have been astronomical m also highly impressed at how long the film was able to keep the action and sense of excitement going from start to finish the final battle lasted roughly half an hour without getting bogged down or becoming overly repetitive add in some typically whedon esque humor and fair number of insider references to the comics avengers is mighty entertainment and everything that fans could have hoped for look forward to marvel inevitable follow up and to the director next project don know why it taken so long but joss whedon has finally arrived in hollywood and expect to see much more of him in the near future ', ' show used to be outside but now show is going low budget or something everything is inside it boring ', ' it on right now m so bored and underwhelmed am typing whilst the awful script story no one cares about and cheap looking cgi chug on in the background they just didn even try to make it entertaining ', ' had the extreme pleasure of seeing this movie last weekend at facebook fan screening in hollywood waited in line for 2 hrs to see this movie and was greeted by the surprise appearance of writer director josh whedon stars chris thor hemsworh tom loki hiddleston clark agent phil coulson cobie maria hill smulders and producer kevin feige and let me just say would gladly stand in line for another 2 hrs to see it again the avengers in one word was amazing josh whedon and his cast and crew knocked this movie right out of the ball park and into whole new cinematic universe the action humor and story were spot on the action and characters were ripped right out of the pages and put right onto the screen everything you love about the comics is there and then some it was immediately obvious that this movie was made by the fans for the fans it dozen matter if your fan of comics or cartoons everyone will find something to like about this movie just be prepared for roller coaster ride and a great time at the movies have to say when first heard mr whedon was attached to direct as buffy and angel fan was excited but he succeeded all my expectations and then some anyone says you just can write good script with this many actors and give them all their own story arc should attend the josh whedon school of screen writing mr whedon did phenomenal job of handling each character providing every actor big and small their time to shine the avengers have assembled and can wait to see them again an again ', ' what happened to the mcu mean mcu movies were never exactly the pinnacle of cinema but handful of them were great engaging and most of all entertaining wouldn even know where to begin with this mess it was bad but not regular bad like morbious or black adam this was terribad not thing here was interesting the entire time m sitting watching this hoping something interesting would happen and nope nothing all the way through to the end but you know what movie can bomb all the way to the box office everyone can leave their negative review just like what m doing yet something still tells me that marvel disney will not learn damn thing from it ', ' could write walls of text reviewing this masterpiece prefer to keep it simple tho so will just say that this is one of the greatest series ever made series in general not just in the superhero genre if we re speaking only within the borders of the superhero content this is the best yes it is my opinion but think such saying is quite objectively the truth the story the camera work the acting it should not have been cancelled even if it ended on slight cliffhanger it did at least had some feel of closure but still deserved like solid 5 seasons run watch it ', ' so far ms marvel has been amazing there have certainly been some problems with the disney marvel shows but ms marvel has proved to not be one of them it is so great to have show where the fans and nerds are the heroes also love the new diversity being brought into the marvel cinematic universe the cast is amazing was originally very worried about the change in her powers and their origin from the comics think that it will likely work out to have great story it may be on the more lighthearted side the show has potential to be the best marvel show yet ', ' the scale and the characters are way lower then infinite stone series standard black widow as one of the most important character in avengers deserves way better story honestly can believe marvel made this movie so unthoughtful the only purpose of this movie is generate more money from marvel fans ', ' ms marvel is charming the characters are well acted for the most part episode 1 is super light on plot no nod to backstory of the special that gives kamala her powers etc the show is not perfect but the reviewers giving it 1 stars are doing so just because it dares to have muslim american lead story shudder these folks need to get lives back to the show the lead actress is wonderful she reminds me of younger haillee steinfeld from hawkeye she inhabits that space that straddles many archetypes without squarely landing in any of them kid next door peter parker dreamer kid ferris beuller nerd with strict parents her sidekick is tech whiz played by an actor with an astounding resemblance to young neil patrick harris her family provides hilarious background her brother and dad are hysterical while the mom is an auntie gossping and

amazing camerawork cutting and better fight choreo than most of the new star wars stuff the story is lighthearted with really interesting character backgrounds that haven seen in mainstream us production so far and when my daughter is asleep daddy can be naughty boy and watch the boys on prime ', ' this series is probably the worst so far it boring like hell the only episodes that were interesting enough for me to actually keep my eyes open were probably the last 2 and they were still bad it way too long and it offers nothing if it were 2 hour movie then wouldn be as critical however wasting so much freaking time on this show is simply not worth it personally hate the idea of the mcu series in general but still gave them go some of them are good but they could have definitely made 2 2 5 hour movies instead hawkeye for example they didn need to make whole series movie would ve been way better feel like ever since these disney shows appeared marvel started focusing more on quantity over quality ', ' phase 4 continues to disappoint the quality of the streaming shows is subpar it hard to believe that was once excited for every addition to the mcu ', ' there was real opportunity with this film it could have been gritty backstory about difficult upbringing that would have been interesting they could have made natasha all jason borne up and showed her dark espionage skills that would have been interesting the training of an assassin and the emotional dichotomy of paid killer that too would have been interesting instead we got two hours of unimaginite plot with phoned in dialogue delivered by bored actors riddled with clich and borrowed scenes from other much better movies and bever thought would say that about moonraker the only respite was being able to giggle at ray winstone pitiful attempt at russian accent as he would say on the adverts when the fun stops stop ', ' daredevil is grim violent and reasonably grounded the series places heavy emphasis on staging elaborate fight sequences but it doesn skimp on story and character the dialogue is generally excellent performaces are good across the board vincent onofrio kingpin is an acquired taste but once his character gets fleshed out it difficult to imagine better interpretation there a tendency to recycle dramatic elements but the machinations of various villains and factions keep things engaging whenever the plot threatens to stall the only major downsides are the characterizations of the protagonist best friend law partner foggy nelson and secretary love interest karen the total karen think these two are supposed to give the protagonist moral tether but through no fault of the performers foggy often comes across as needy codependent and karen often comes across as sanctimonious busybody they drag things down considerably but thankfully not enough to entirely derail an otherwise excellent show ', ' fans of the comic book won be let down the show has the same fun feel the comic book has ignore the naysayers this is really kamala khan enjoy the show ', ' the opening credit sequence in this movie is one of the best ve ever seen as far as can remember am big fan of 007 movie opening credit sequences they get me excited however for this movie the opening credit sequence hits you like train from the first second it starts till the end the haunting images and an absolute breathtaking rendition of smells like teen spirit just keeps pulling you in until it smacks you right across the face and makes you question the world we live in at that point you think marvel is not playing around this is going to be something new something dark but alas just another marvel movie with jokes in serious situation and physics defying action sequences they did not utilize the villain properly for this film what could ve been dark impactful movie that would ve been talked about for years became just another semi superhero action movie its good watch though watched it with friends and we enjoyed it but it just leaves you wanting more you ll wish the movie was something very different or you may not that just how felt ', ' market is full of such product sell something new exiting just fight fight fight nothing else no geadnor tail ', ' well it is all an out natasa movie loved to see her in individual marvel space expecting more in the continuation and can already connect the dots on where it is going with bucky new cap and yelena there is big but couldn connect with her emotinally wish they could show her past more the family reunion was good but it was too fast to connect the story has loop holes in many places not convincing at all watched the movie in 3 4 breaks and finished watching just to see post credit scenes as usual marvel always find ways to put humor in scenes kudos to the writers the action sequences are pretty much super heroic it would have definitely give great experiance in theater but on ott platform it is missing that spark in the end it is good bye to great marvel character who has shown emence potential to overcome from any situation without having any superpower blackwidow survived and gave great life lessons it could have been much better send off would love to see scarlet in different roles in the marvel universe ', ' so the marvel netflix alliance ends here not with bang but with bit of whimper jessica jones kristen ritter is private investigator functioning alcoholic and misanthrope she also thanks to some illegal experimentation unworldly strong resilient and tough she struggles with the responsibility that comes with being powerered and is haunted by death of her family which occurred in traffic accident years prior the first season of jessica jones was excellent mostly because unlike some other seasons of both this show and the others in the extended universe it had an excellent and charismatic villain in david tennent kilgrave without having the same levels of action set pieces this first season still is as good as anything that daredevil or punisher could produce the season also introduced us to luke cage which then spun into his own series and mike coulters chemistry with ritter is excellent unfortunately unlike daredevil there was pronounced drop off in quality for the second season and that run had dull villain from jessica past played by janet mcteer drifting away from the private eye type story and into more soap elements didn help this run either we also started to spend even more time with the shows supporting characters such as jeri hogarth played by carrie anne moss though she was great the show feels watered down when we re spending time with these characters and it not related directly to what happening to jessica the second and third seasons also suffer from the netflix problem of making 13 episodes when you have enough story for 8 so plot points are hit over and over again the third season is better though jessica is back with case to solve involving serial killer played by jeremy bobb there more action and intrigue although it still doesn match the heights of the first season it would be easy to see why their hearts wouldn be in this run as the cancellations were announced long before this was released overall feel like the first season of this is must see but the remaining two aren essential the show isn as consistent as daredevil but is generally cut above iron fist and luke cage ', ' am neither marvel fan nor hater even like some of their worse films like the spiderman series but also disliked popular ones like thor like their movies more when they take themselves to serious when first watched the avengers it was on an airplane so beautiful rendered cgi and effects weren influencing me through the small screen so it was mostly watching the story for me and really think its marvels worst loki taking over the earth shield corporations super heroes on pms emotions and obscure aliens even worse were superfluous characters like the black widow it was just huge mess of sci fi and super hero clich so why do give it 5 mediochre rating because it had good acting some funny scenes and when watched on huge screen is pretty it makes little sense but it entertains would say for people who cant stand unlogical stories this would propably rate much lower my sister hated it g and for marvel fans its just nice fanservice ', ' episode 1 was nice ep 2 still ok at ep 3 didn even really watched the show anymore and had it on just to listen bit same at ep 4 but at around min 10 turned it off completely because it was just so boring that it felt like total waste of time and energy am still going to watch the movie since still enjoy the mcu even if it generic but this show is just disappointing ', ' yawn fest at best gave up caring after uber distressing child exploitation at start of film awful characters who you don care for particularly the child trafficking parents such dark and depressing back story should never have been glorified or turned into long slow depressing movie ', ' started watching this series with fair amount of scepticism m not generally fan of marvels watered down spin off series that always feels bit anticlimactic and slightly pointless however did start by liking the aesthetic of this series it looked good it was geared towards younger audiences with the styling whilst still keeping the marvel film look but by the end of the first episode was already rolling my eyes thought it was great to have young muslim girl represented in superhero movies and it hit on some great points but then it quickly deteriorated into every single minority represented series everyone in her family became caricature of their faith just like every black cast movie seems to make their colour their entire personality m white woman and even sighed at how lazy this representation is her brother has literally nothing else about him except his religion ffs gave up after the 4th episode there were opportunities to confront awkward questions of problems with any faith but everything was so on the nose it just felt like box ticking ', ' weak story weak villians and they ruined taskmaster one of the coolest villians from the comics found the action scenes boring and the kids lost interest and went on their tablets the future of marvel movies is looking pretty dismal ', ' weeding out the very obvious social justice messaging here which comes off as cliche any more we have another overproduced predictable superficial cartoon masquerading as something more than it really is the craftsmanship is there in terms of acting production audio mixing etc but strip all of that away and there just isn anything all that interesting to see want to immerse yourself in feminist super hero universe with depth range and meaning skip captain marvel and binge the buffy the vampire slayer series ', ' now liked this movie lot but it didn have the same charm as the solo movies had it was like if something was missing but other than that this movie was great it brings all your favourite superheroes together to fight the big back guy the jokes are funny and the story is ok but there could have been some more character development instead of big long battle at the end but still enjoyed this movie would recommend this movie to anyone new to the marvel universe ', ' the avengers is brilliant take on the marvel comic series that were made in 1964 the avengers is worth watching can say money well spent war breaks out on earth and its good vs evil as the avengers battle for the fate of the earth the avengers is epic film which is one of the if not the best comic book movie it made records taking in 623 279 547 beating harry potter and the deathly hallows it was shocking that the avengers did so well as it was partly disney film and people thought it wouldn do well the avengers was one of the blockbusters of 2012 beating others like the dark knight rises and the amazing spider man the avengers is overall brilliant film and recommend that everyone should watch it ', ' tony stark is the consultant the consultant 2011 is the first film in the marvel one shots series set after the events of iron man 2 and the incredible hulk the consultant explains what happened before the post credits scene of the incredible hulk ', ' usually have very high standards for movies this is curse because have hard time enjoying most movies this movie was such treat and pleasant surprise the story the jokes the combat the acting everything was above and beyond what d expect from marvel movie thought how to train your dragon 3 would be my favorite movie of the year for 2019 captain marvel just took it place and did not see it coming at all ', ' sloppy woke no story no direction boring horrible ve never given review like this wow just bad stop with the every gender and culture is some sort of victim it would make for better super hero show if you didn ', ' the show is good but nothing spectacular was hopeful that it would be bit more thrilling like the movies colson is by far the primary thing that keeps the show going his personality is one that draws you into his character you tend to want him to succeed because he seems to actually care my one complaint is one of personal nature feel like almost every week there is some stab at faith in god nothing diabolical but subtle jabs at those who believe one example is girl who believes in god and the statement is made that people believe what they need to believe another is asked if she believes in god and her response is not really get it am fine with the fact that many do not believe in god many of those object to god being brought into things unless of course it is dismissive like said personal issue ', ' don know where to start really it just dreadful film the timeline seems really poor one film humans have space aliens land on their planet few years films later humans have massive space stations and ships defending portal near earth feels like several decades of time has been skipped the storyline of this film is shockingly poor and predictable the fight scenes look slow motion so the actors can perform them easily and very badly done the acting is sub par young girl is super hero capable of fighting off lots of assailants not likely doesn seem surprised to be fighting aliens or people with guns yet turns into shy girl when she sees another hero the blonde marvel character seems incapable of showing any emotion except for her eyes looking shocked throughout the entire film also having two characters with pretty much the same name is lazy this film along with all their recent ones should never have been made ', ' m 14 years old the perfect age for superhero movies loved the batman trilogy liked the iron man movies and ahh what the spider man movies where okay guess when heard the avengers was coming to the theaters was going nuts liked every superhero movie but the avengers no boring unnecessary complicated story and almost no action why is everybody so thrilled about this movie go watch something real fun with cool story m pretty disappointed hope the avengers 2 will be better m sorry for the bad english ', ' watched few webseries but nothing felt this much genuine it felt sad that it ended on season 7 hope the officials will carry over next seasons honestly saying this webseries have life in it ', ' ms marvel is the top marvel hero at the moment for me add brie larsons down to earth captain marvel and one of her childhood friends from her own movie and boom you got the best comic movie in long time d like to inform all superhero movie purists that it is comic movie featuring superheroes as comic movie is not supposed to be your all action no fun movie but comical action movie the comical spirit of ms marvel versus captain marvels and captain rambeau disciplined spirit is the best combo thought we would never see from marvel anymore with the guardians as the only exception but it seems was wrong and it seems that james gunn finally has competition in nia dacosta at marvel m already looking forward to adil and bilals second season of ms marvel ', ' really don understand the bad reviews enjoyed this film very much epic action and emotional scenes that made me cry for me an amazing film loved from the first to the last moment ', ' over the five series the sites has had some great moments and some awful ones overall the cast is very strong mix of talent and you can always find few gems in every episode the dynamics of the character development has been great and despite the occasional blip on each series they always end strong if marvel want to continue to have tv presence marvel agents of shield is definitely flag ship project ', ' an american fantasy action adventure story about stolen mystical artefact that if activated will bring about an alien invasion spymaster brings together team of superheroes to defend earth from the impending attack the film has satisfyingly humorous and lighthearted touch with robert downey jr and others delivering fast talking one liners that break just at the right time some of the humour comes from the battle for supremacy among the avengers which is also gratifying that said while the visual effects and stunts keep the viewer engaged it does lag from lack of imagination in the plot the fighting is repetitive and while cgi is used well some of the cartoonish manoeuvres made by hulk in film trying to keep some semblance of scientific plausibility are frankly implausible tom hiddlestone menace is engaging with his wide piercing eyes and sibilant line delivery but unfortunately he plays second fiddle to the prime villains who are featureless ', ' highly recommend it it provides window into the every day life of muslim teenage girl very eye opening can not wait for more episodes am hooked ', ' admit m not the biggest sucker for marvel but do love good action and was expecting more from the trailer than the movie could fullfill the acting was not in par with the effects and the storyline was not good at all ', ' really enjoyed the story and the focus on women believe everyone will like this movie peace brian bruce ', ' as finished watching the avengers the main thought in my head was why on earth did they get joss whedon to write this whedon is master of witty earthy dialogue and anyone who ever watched buffy angel or firefly knows that he can direct action scenes and powerful interpersonal character connections often in the same scene who directed this bland one dimensional shoot em up and what have you done with joss whedon this humorless cgi fest could have been handled by any number of robotic hollywood hacks looked forward to this movie because was over the moon with excitement at the thought that it couldn be typical jump cut screaming video game and that pretty much what we have here the jokes are flat and the dialogue is embarrassing thought scarlett johannsson was charming and usually don like her too much but even worse is how the always incredibly watchable mark ruffalo was rendered total snooze how is that possible robert downey is sarcastic as always and fun to watch but god it was just so not good real letdown all around like potential greatness flattened and made super dumb by the hollywood crap machine ', ' let me be clear the acting is alright but the plot is by far as boring as it physical can be it a high teenage life growing up series with special effects if you want to watch such show watch something different that is actually good disney can be glad that they don have rating system on thier platform if you haven seen it you miss absolut nothing in life and can be glad that you didn lost lifetime watching it ', ' attempted to watch the marvels contemplating whether cinema visit might have been the better choice intriguingly the film features cat in seemingly pivotal role this feline character is not merely background element it prominently meows throughout almost as if to constantly remind viewers of its presence perhaps even enticing them to purchase related merchandise however this recurring meowing inadvertently distressed my own cat leading to rather frustrating viewing experience for me expecting cinematic escape instead found myself managing my pet anxiety and confusion caused by the illusion of another cat presence regrettably discontinued watching after 20 minutes hope that someday cat owner within the marvel studios team will recognize that such repetitive animal sounds are unnecessary and can be disruptive for household pets until then viewers like myself might face unexpected challenges in enjoying their films ', ' probably the most ordinary marvel movie yet there was nothing to take away from this movie the acting was average and the storyline was mediocre and felt rushed apart from few funny moments from supporting actors and the visual effects this was just ordinary and has been done before ', ' the marvels begins with an interesting idea what if superheroes switched places every time they used their powers but that concept never seems to reach its full potential as it merely minor inconvenience for the characters this movie also suffers because the muddled plot is so entangled with other mcu shows you ll need to watch at least captain marvel wandavision and ms marvel to fully understand what going on also since kamala kahn is practically the only character with charisma the movie relies on her little too much enjoyed parts of the marvels but not the movie as whole ', ' black widow is blast well worth the wait for this character to have her very own movie do wish it came after captain america civil war in 2017 but that fine lot of action drama and just pinch of comedy in there and this made me feel tad bit more connected to natasha romanoff if you haven seen this film watch it it well deserved ', ' this was fantastic movie and great story people that have anything less to say are overly critical and have nothing else to do but complain awesome movie ', ' whenever new tv series or movie is announced based on one of my favourite comic book heroes try not to get my expectations to high but can help it most days and come up with how think it should be with daredevil did the same and wanted it to be darker layout than the rest of marvel but most of all to have long intriguing story and wasn disappointed from the get go was hooked the show manages to leave behind the faults of other programmes with their repetitive nature and instead include ongoing narrative with sub plots that weave into the main story the acting and casting is perfect that makes you actually feel for the characters unlike with gotham with the humour of foggy being relief from the tortured soul of matt murdock onofrio is perfect as fisk and is different from any villain ve seen and karen page is great character who has fallen victim to the violence in hell kitchen there are shocks and twists to enjoy but it the fight sequences that amaze when you see episode 2 you ll understand bring on season 2 ', ' 2 hours of patriotic home grown russians who lived in russia their whole lives talking to each other in english but with painfully forced russian accents m not even russian and know their accents are comically off good to watch if you can ignore it ', ' it has the american pie song so 9 just for that also fell in love with yelena just make her the female deadpool wanna see red guardian fight captain america while telling stories of his father and wanna see olga be more taskmastery in more movies without the mind control of her father and without the mask as for black widow well always loved her so no changes here sad that there will be no more of her ll miss her but seriously 9 for american pie ', ' having actors and actresses that are not russian is the biggest problem with this movie its sad to seeing on how much this movie does not like to rely on authenticity but instead relies solely on commercialising the movie with american and british actors instead the plot is average and the action we ve seen before like the movie tries to play smart but instead it turns out to be boring affair and ray winstone seems to look like geordie instead of what one assume to be tragic garbage performance as russian ', ' this is the first marvel show that has me constantly grabbing my head poiting logical inconsistencies multiple times per episode understand shows having few logic mistakes across season but after only 2 episodes this is just too much think the target audience for this is at most 12 yrs old really hope it will be stand alone thing and not spillover in the main cinematic universe so don have to keep watching this to keep up ', ' although am more of dc snyderverse fan black widow didn disappoint it as good as captain marvel but fun and funnier tbh wasn sure about the johansen and pugh tandem would work out but surprisingly it did most of all love that it wasn trying too hard to be something bigger than other mcu movies this was seamless and perfect also the end credits got me really excited thank you marvel to all the negative reviews and trolls stop watching movies on your phones ', ' any comic book movie worth its salt far as budgets go can give us terrific action with mind blowing cgi and special effects marvel the avengers the culmination of the work of five movies one of them sequel to the first iron man is stuffed with good load of action and mayhem and climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes captain america incredible hulk thor and tony stark plus relative newcomers black widow and hawkeye with nick fury and agent colson in the wings and if you want to get your money shots joss whedon doesn skimp out but the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasn just for name cachet though it probably helped what whedon done over much of his career in tv and other films and webseries buffy firefly dr horrible angel etc was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical supernatural other worldly alien forces but making it always about stakes humor horror drama and solid conflicts villains don just act nasty they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do and if they re not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters full of the stuff that makes them great to watch especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone e the mayor on buffy for those that recall so here we get loki previously villain in thor and later sort of brought back for thor 2 and is by far the highlight of the film as tom hiddleston chews up scenery but does it in kind of elegant theatrical relishing way by the time he spews out muelling quim you re on the edge of your seat his performance what he does with every moment of screen time is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky and yet his ego and petty mindedness does him in and whedon has lot of fun writing this character making him threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstances this is one of the best of the marvel films just by the way that whedon goes about the sort of ghostbusters ninja turtles formula the four main players each distinct playing off one another but things could turn on dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that along with hiddleston downey once again makes tony stark helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters and johansson actually has few really great scenes whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other complex male characters to shame and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on she stands out especially widow scene with loki ruffalo too does lot with little until he gets to the other guy don know if avengers is great art but it does what want to see when go to big giant behemoth like spectacles provide me host of characters who have to work together and gives them interesting entertaining and believable things to say at 142 minutes it goes by at great pace as well not too fast not too slow nothing drags here and that counts as well along with the first iron man and the recent marvel netflix show daredevil this is the mcu at the top of their game ', ' had high hopes for this series hoping it be different from most series on tv sadly it just slow paced intrigue about an ex soldier trying to find justice along the way we meet lot of clich justice officers bad guys and military ex military m at episode 6 and it the most can take it badly written don care for any characters and you can see everything that going to happen before it happen from miles away m huge punisher fan but d be surprised if came back to finish to watch it ', ' in short it was an okay movie not bad but not good part of this is the timing of release we know she will be dead in the near future so the stakes do not seem very palpable this could have been much more compelling and flavorful movie but instead we got another fast film that primarily serves to move to larger plot of the mcu along ', ' man this movie is so generic meaning identical to thousands of others that could actually predict every single scene 10 minutes on this are too much time it better spent cleaning the bathroom ', ' this show is for kids and could be the worst ve seen when it comes to marvel avengers not surprised the 2nd movie flopped enjoyed every marvel spinoff but this was hard to watch hope they don keep going down this road avenger movies shows were never this corny you ll enjoy it if ur kid but kids don belong in the avengers even though it all fiction disney will put anything out now to make buck smh don like hating on peoples work because it takes time and dedication but would rather skip rocks wanted to make this short but it won let me my rating was actually 1 but couldn hate that hard ', ' the marvels is sad example of how promising combination of characters and universes can be ruined by excessive banality and infantilism the film tries to capitalize on the success of characters like carol danvers kamala khan and monica rambeau but ends up drowning in chaotic and incoherent plot the very premise of the film with characters swapping places every time they use their powers seems like it was taken from an episode of children tv show while attempts to explain this strange dynamic through quantum concepts are commendable the end result is more confusing than engaging furthermore the characterization of the characters seems to have been simplified to the extreme turning potentially interesting heroes into flat and stereotypical caricatures brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani do their best with what they have but they can work miracles with such superficial screenplay even the action sequences usually strong point of marvel films fall into the territory of repetition and lack of inventiveness battles against the kree villains seem more like an excuse to showcase special effects than central element of the plot in conclusion the marvels is disappointing film that fails to fully exploit the potential of its characters and premise with confusing plot flat characterization and uninspired action sequences this film remains among the less memorable chapters of the marvel cinematic universe ', ' thought another coming of age new migrant series was on tap and was wrong learned more about pakistani culture in three hours than in 6 decades of slogging about the world very entertaining ', ' finally this is great marvel tv series and by far the best the previous marvel offerings have been very dismal to say the least luke cage jessica jones defenders runaways iron fist but punisher is brilliant deep gritty and adult jon bernthal is fantastic in the role and can imagine any other actor doing it as well he gives the role the power and charisma that is required congratulations to the casting team for getting this one right definitely the only marvel show to watch ', ' it was fine overall didn like anything about the first captain marvel movie so never expected to even watch this one eventually saw some footage that got me interested and ended up liking some parts ll agree that the script never should have been approved with such an underwritten villain and that the story was impossible to care about the thing that carried it for me was that was enjoying the three main characters together kamala was the key without her there was no reason for this movie whatsoever hope they can use her in something better eventually at this point however ll be fine if marvel just holds off for while ', ' great cultural representation and storyline ms marvel although super hero movie is relevant to current times great work at relating to the current generation good portrayal of intercultural challenges too in funny and quirky way actors have done great job ', ' this one should ve come out next to black panther it too late now the post credit scene made me roll my eyes ', ' this movie taught me to lower my expactations as much as possible it was good movie entertaining funny in some ways would watch it again no wouldn the action in this movie was great the costumes were perfect and the plot twists were exciting over all the movie needed little more wow factor it was somewhat underwhelming considering it took marvel 10 years to give black widow her solo movie pugh and johansson had amazing chemistry hope to see them together again ', ' this show is for young teens and doesn seem to tie into anything going on in this phase of the mcu m super disappointed as it had potential and if they decide to do young avengers movie later on down the road disney will absolutely ruin it m currently on episode 5 and it so damn boring it unreal ', ' think this was very good show and in many respects better than the first season there is villain or two but this time it much more insidious because it comes almost from within the second season of jessica jones takes deep dive into things hidden and buried and affords us good look into the central character background psychological make up and everything that defined her so far suffice it to say that the issues tackled are very difficult and of course painful this is what makes the second season of jessica jones so emotionally gripping and powerful m happy that it was renewed for third season ', ' its fun show where its overrated at best like it but it just lacked flavor season 1 was good great season 2 was good season 3 skipped because knew who would happen and didn want to grind through this show think netflix could do so much better by adding more fun rather than going full gloomy its basically the same with all marvel netflix m kinda happy that these shows have ended only punisher really like ', ' im huge marvel fan watched all the mcu movies and series and was so excited about this one seen all the episodes and hoped for some positive effect on me but the plot is disappointing music is just so cheap the special effects are shocking for what possible nowadays and the acting is questionable just really hope that the upcoming connected plot in the mcu won be that painful to watch sorry for the downgrading review many have great rates for this show and understand all tastes are different so is my opinion on this one sadly ', ' movie is only and only for ages between 6 16 anyone with any expectation from cinema should skip this one movie for video game addcits no clear plot everything is foreseeable nothing new just piled on to make difference too much of mediocre ends up creating something less then mediocre pity the time and the money spent on this usual hollywood garbage think people should wait for it to come on tv not even worth the dvd or bluray everyone here with positive comment has fantasy world where super heros are logical if the movie was shorter maybe could let myself go but it is tooooo long brother telling you skip this one and thank me later ', ' the best series and the best character and the best sniper and the best beautiful punisher this series and they they chose the best choice because they chose john bernthal ', ' wanted to like this but the unbelievable melodrama and the lack of any discernible character development just killed it for me this should have been 6 episode story arc that might have been good as it is just wanted it to end for the last 8 episodes at least the individual eps are generally enjoyable enough but the overarching storyline is lame and artificially elongated over and over again the writers are probably largely to blame but most of the actors fail to do much beyond recite the lines the sole exception is david tennant like the actors involved but they fail to convince me they are their characters it was long for the sake of being long and it suffered immensely for it 6 ep run would have allowed me to forgive most of its other weaknesses also the choreography was weak almost none of the fight scenes are enjoyable or entertaining to watch ', ' the film vot nothing except for rachel weisz acting ', ' prequel to all the other mcu movies captain marvel shows us the early beginnings of nick fury and introduces us to captain marvel watching samuel jackson for 2 hours as nick fury is what you would expect it to be funny bad ass and stylish the movie is great set up for endgame and links up the end of infinity war nicely while beginning the last part of the story in the epic mcu have seen people give this movie just 4 stars but urge you to look past them as this movie came just before endgame and people were so hyped for it they just let this one pass them by but this movie delivers no less than any other mcu movie with great introduction to an epic character in the mcu ', ' going from the loki series finale this morning to the marvels this evening was for lack of better word bonkers the finale was perfect and beautiful ending to the show while the marvels is complete mess it honestly given me whiplash the marvels is just an all around bad movie the script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed which both have an impact on how well the characters and in turn the actors come across on screen the action and humour are kind of alright and the vfx are definitely better than anything we ve seen in an mcu project since doctor strange in the multiverse of madness with the obvious exceptions of guardians of the galaxy vol 3 and loki season 2 but that still doesn exactly make it look great this movie is just painful to watch at points early on it has some really fun moments and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining but that feeling vanished as soon as it came it barley better than ant man and the wasp quantumania so you can do with that information what you will ', ' can understand why this show has so many good reviews some of the actors are actually not bad but the overacting of some of the main characters is so shockingly bad and the story just keeps on dragging along 13 episodes could easily be halved what disappointment ', ' complete disappointment and disaster of movie first when saw the cartoon part and the beginning it was sing do not watch but as big fan of marvel ve decided to give it chance that was second mistake movie is made for children with for me no connection to what marvel is supposed to be acting average except for samuel jackson how did good as it gets introducingto many new characters confuses viewer especially one who is fan of avengers iron man hulk captain america spiderman who is customed to old characters or at least mian character story is interrupted with switching stories between characters definitely expected more for marvel rip stan lee ', ' which was comprehensive story and good action season 2 is just bland talkfest and little actions not really deserving the original punisher the lead actors seem to be as bored as the viewer seriously am unable to continue watching this stuff ', ' not sure who the target audience for this movie was but it didn feel like the usual would think it aimed more for early teens the way it was done not great humour not fantastic acting and the plot and story just felt little disjointed and not very deep it was hard to follow what was happening at times and quite few things didn make sense or were difficult to understand the effects at times were impressive and fun to watch but that the only positive thing at least to the standard of mcu we are used to just one opinion but didn enjoy this at all did really feel like this was aimed at much younger audience ', ' joss whedon finally gets an enormous budget to play with as he co writes and directs this slab of super powered fun highly watchable from the first scene to the inevitable easter egg whedon made the crucial decision to please the fans at no point during the mammoth 142 minutes play time does it feel unnecessarily dragged out robert downey jr again excels as tony stark iron man however the other cast members deserve lot of credit for not letting his performance overshadow theirs mark ruffalo is near perfect as bruce banner the incredible hulk taking the role from ed norton who played the less than jolly green giant in his last big screen outing as friend said at last they got hulk right indeed the hulk provides two moments of pure comedy without insulting his mythos hurdle lots of comic hero adaptations fail to clear cgi is used to enhance rather than substitute for plot something other blockbusters should take note of people unfamiliar with the marvel characters could be confused as to who who and why but m sure after little bit they ll be able to sit back and enjoy there is glaring continuity error though in some scenes the arc reactor in stark chest can clearly be seen glowing beneath his shirt as it should be because if it wasn glowing he be dead then in other scenes whilst stark in civvies no arc reactor can be seen in film of this magnitude and budget this seems quite negligent avengers assemble will be the movie to beat of 2012 in terms of sheer entertainment we saw it in max which unlike normal 3d is worth paying for if you love super heroes you ll love this movie ', ' couldn find anything redeeming about this one got bored half hour in and vegged out for another half before turning it off saw some other reviews mention you need to watch one of the series to understand what going on in this movie and that helped me understand why felt like was constantly missing some context for the plot unfortunately none of the marvel tv shows pulled me in long enough to get through more than handful of episodes and ve let them pass by for awhile now d think creators would know by now it unwise to make movie that can stand on its own and has to use another form of media as crutch for people to follow along or become invested ', ' review from pakistan 1 star for iman 1 star for fawad 1 star for mehwish 3 total 3 stars for few pretty and famous faces kindergarten story awful action and clueless cgi if this is becoming part of main marvel then mcu is ruined no doubt kamala is beautiful m in love with her but innocent expressions are not guarantee of successful series wish to see her in different genres in the future good effort overall ', ' not counting inhumans as never watched it this is probably the worst of the mcu they ve completely dropped the ball on this one this would ve probably worked as cute teenage drama comedy but like all the superhero stuff just ruined it which is obviously problem as it a superhero show there just far too much going on to cram into 6 episodes and one of those is even flashback episode new protagonist her friends religion culture family school love interest probably more stuff and being superhero on top of that it was just never going to work the only saving grace is iman vellani as kamala khan she plays the character so well she so fun and energetic just how kamala should be let just hope that when she appears in other properties they re better than this show feel like this is one of those situations where journalists are too afraid to actually speak their minds about how bad this show is in case they come across as racist ', ' seriously can rewind life by two hours and not watch the film swore wasn bothered about seeing this film but having son who a big marvel film fan we watched it turns out it received lukewarm reception from him as well why is goose the best thing about this film why is there so much hype about this film truly don know thought needed to see this film before endgame so was suckered by the son into seeing it both of us wish we hadn bothered my son and both love marvel and dc we say marvel for films and dc for series but this well honestly it felt more like dc flop of film not what we have come to expect from some amazing marvel films ', ' even if you ignore the virtue signalling its pretty slow and boring attempt by disney to cash in on the marvel franchise my three kids all lost interest in the series and did not want to watch it anymore ', ' such enjoyable and interesting series everything is great ', ' this movie is the work ve ever seen m not kidding after this don want to see any more films in my entire life have seen everything that can be possible in film mindblowing fantastic thrilling funny excellent marvel has done something no one else have ever done before putting together all these different superheroes in one fantastic franchise and making it work wonderfully it might seen little over powered but the feeling you get watching all of these personalities fight together makes it work marvel have actually made me do something ve never done before write review kind of on imdb and you have got to deliver for me to do that kind of things just the best movie ve ever seen 10 10 ', ' missed the opportunity to see black widow at the cinema and now regret that decision thought it was going to be forced effort soaked in pc bull it is good action movie with the sequences as good as you could hope for and its family drama part at least resembles an effort of human being what m most impressed about is that shortland managed to put her personal stamp on the project and still make movie that belongs to the mcu some of the indoor stuff reminded me of the soviet cinema story and characters are believable enough that you care which is think rare feat nowadays especially in something as mainstream as marvel harbour is cliche but an adorable one weisz is charming as always and pugh continues to be revelation and one of the better actresses to emerge over the past half decade or so the accent play left me ambivalent florence hard comes and goes and as slav am allowed to be snob about it also don know what to do with dreykov daughter on that note when are we going to have an actual russian criminal play movie russian criminal instead of all these winstons and brannaghs m just messing with you m mocking these voices that have gained steam which suggest you can do anything outside of what you are if you re white at least well woke ladies and gentlemen of 2021 that called acting and ray makes for convincing russian roughneck he even looks like one it good to have small scale super hero stuff here and there it brings the things down to earth everything slows down and you can enjoy and appreciate the details something liked about the 1st season of daredevil at the end send my love to scarlett dozen years in this universe is madness ', ' watched the first 4 episodes overall very boring series with bad dialogues bad writing bad acting from all the actors bad humor tasteless aesthetics full of cliches and stereotypes about superheroes teens muslims huge marvel fan but ll pass on this one ', ' too much family drama and cliche story writing overall it a worst addition to mcu black widow deserves better ', ' 2 hours of cringe complete waste of time not only did it take hundred years to get released it took forever to get to the end of the movie terrible cgi weak plot mon could even tell how terrible the movie was going to be when watched the trailer ', ' the times when iron man captain america and the avengers were made are gone no more quality marvel movies are done now the acting and screen play are really bad the marvel fans could have come up with better ideas for this script than these so called writers and directors the movie looks like cheap version of star trek mixed with power rangers couldn last more than 15 min really wanted to give it chance in spite of the bad reviews have seen am glad waited the movie to come out on disney and didn go to watch it in cinema hopefully disney will change their thoughts and perspectives for the next upcoming marvel movies unless they keep wanna disappointing the fans of the franchise ', ' shocking glammed up disney twaddle completely ruined the marvel universe can say enough bad things about this film turned it off at the musical if this is the sign of the things to come after being fan of the books for so many years you can count me out why are disney so intent on glamming things up like mary poppins movie have no idea who is employing the script writers but they need sacking long for another judge dredd movie or series or the punisher this type of movie is an insult to marvel there is so much material out there producing something like this is disgraceful and unworthy of marvel title ', ' the best superhero show that ve seen and seriously have seen so many but nothing like this the fight scenes are awesome the more you go into the series think the elektra part was not the best but not bad and the main villain is just perfect idk why theire cancelling the show is it the only one that annoyed me from all netflix cancel stuff ', ' ve just completed watching all of season one of daredevil didn start watching until the whole season was out and ended up pulling marathon viewing of all 13 episodes because absolutely could not stop this is one incredible show the casting is perfect the fight scenes are superbly choreographed the story is gripping it is dark brutal and gritty ve been fan of hero and superhero films and tv shows since was child ve rarely been so impressed by any that have come before this is an absolute must watch for any comic fan honestly don think anyone can watch this and not love it the only negative is now having to wait for season two its going to be an excruciating several months but at least it gives me time to watch season one several more times bravo to all persons involved in bringing this to us bravo ', ' find it very difficult to write review of superhero films the reason for this is what are they really other than the cinematic version of mcdonald meal quick and easy to produce look good fill you up but ultimately do very little that good for you only you don realise this and then repeat the experience hoping next time will be better this was fine it passes the time it got all the bells and whistles you ve come to expect from marvel film and this one has the ever likable chris evans in the lead so that elevates this slightly it not good though it fluff utterly forgettable fluff wish the whole genre would disappear quickly ', ' it the best show ve ever seen it is my favourite but saddly it got cancelled ', ' this series started off well great characters storylines and action but as always in todays american shows levels of emotional incompetence direct storylines the ideas are good the acting flawless as is the cgi and the variations of events can be quite engaging but its those moment of stupidity which spoil the scenes military agents suddenly become soap opera victims over little things displaying over the top responses to enemy plans and selfish decisions to save their plans for the world great show to watch and definitely worth seeing to the end if you don mind the odd days of lives moment here and there and the occasional bold and beautiful reaction ', ' first of all will not be referring to this film by the crap uk name of avengers assembled the film is the avengers and that all it needs to be called this is biggest and most anticipated film from the last few years it is sequel to the marvel films iron man 2008 iron man 2 2010 thor 2011 captain america 2011 and the incredible hulk 2008 but is it possible to make one film starring them all would it work with all of them in lead roles the film brings together iron man robert downey jr thor chris hemsworth captain america chris evans the hulk mark ruffalo along with h e d agents hawkeye jeremy renner black widow scarlett johansson and nick fury samuel jackson they join forces against thor brother loki tom hiddleston who has unleashed an alien race upon the earth so he can conquer it as many of you will know by now am huge action movie and comic adaption fan so this film exactly what was looking for kept away from many reviews and possible spoilers however had to see the trailers after seeing them and being blown away got little worried for the film many trailers use so much of the action and plot that they show most of the good parts of the film really hoped that this wouldn happen with this one wanted this film to be good after the first 5 minutes was worried the film started out well but there was really really bad camera cut edit for film fan it stood out and slapped me in the face started to worry that it was sign of things to come however my fears were soon dispelled as the film sucked me in with outstanding direction visuals and 3d effects like have never seen before the way the film was prepared starting out with iron man in 2008 and then tying in all the following films together are big lead up to this one huge gamble but it really paid off the outstanding cast work so well together with all these larger than life characters already having their own individual stories told all what was left was to bring them together but first they start out against each other their individual egos explode as they battle each other with explosive devastation soon they all share common goal and start to band together then the film really lets to up until this point it was amazing when they finally start working together that when an amazing movie exceeds all expectations and takes the superhero genre to level never before seen this is also the point then the 3d effects take on whole new level prior to this they were used for depth and clarity of the film very well but now it bring you in to the film and doesn let go the greatest effect is an alien ship appearing from over your head it actually startled me as it appeared above my head before it was on the screen never before outside of theme park has 3d film managed this fortunately it didn just meet my expectations it exceeded them more than ever thought possible really can find the right words to convey how good this film really is it has moments where you laugh so hard you cry amazingly the best of these involve the hulk there are moments where you find yourself holding your breath at the sheer scope of what you are seeing the action raises the bar for the genre to maybe unattainable heights this film is so very good usually rate films on scale of 1 10 but 10 feels inadequate for this so for this one am using 1 100 this film scores 99 only losing out on 100 due to the single bad edit at the start of the film joss whedon has managed the impossible with this film and pulled of film no one expected to be so good for this reason and for the first time my stand out performance is the director joss whedon for creating perfect superhero movie you have to see this on the biggest screen you can find and in 3d ', ' just came out of the cinemas from watching it on the first day and have to admit it was better than expected expected an action movie with awesome graphics and fight scenes and that what you get world class entertainment enjoyed the character development and subtle hints that give bigger meaning also this movie has chunk of comedy not the annoying kind but the kind that blends into the movie perfectly to give you laugh but not take away the seriousness of the film too much it was clich but what can you expect the actor are flawless and keep up with who they are meant to be the only part really didn like but also didn expect was the lack of feeling lot of the good movies watch come out feeling different like the movie has effected me but felt nothing except for one part but it wasn enough to give real feeling to the movie all in all this is an action packed movie sure to give you entertainment not boring at all funny has some smart moments and must see movie for anyone ', ' well if there were any short comings offered by this movie the superb cast and their excellent performances hid them additionally am certain there were massive egos to contend with but the director joss whedon did superb job keeping that aspect in tow can say this movie was well worth the astronomical cost per person nor the wasted time watching tv commercials but it had more value for the buck than some of the other tripe sat through in the past the storyline was fast paced the cgis did not outperform the actors actresses and the pontifications were eclipsed by things blowing up and all those awful bad guys getting their butts kicked gladly spent the big bucks to see it in the theater and will purchase dvd copy that way can watch it few more times without breaking the bank this was an excellent swan song for the avengers on that note would suggest sequel no way why spoil good thing let these stars characters exit on positive note as american wait not just american but world heroes instead of bunch of drum banging narcissists supporting some whimsical divisive hollyweird agenda that only they can afford to care about sorry that is such sour note to end with good job or bravo zulu one and all ', ' the beginning did not catch my attention enough and always treasure good beginnings however the story progresses very well and is told in careful manner some humour is definitely there as well but can tell if there too much of it or too little the plot twist is quite an important feature and you will never see it coming that what got me the most excited in the middle of the movie brie larson plays the part quite well juggling between the robotic soldier she was made to be and another part of her that existed long time ago maybe some scenes are just little too robotic compared to her other kree companions overall it definitely good movie to watch and there is lot of different opinions about it some people love it some people hate it am sort of in between ', ' buy far the worst marvel movie by now wasn expecting too much anyway ', ' it used to be good these last two seasons have just gotten way way off in story lines getting worse the writting has fallen off the acting is always good but seems as if though they need to get back on track and follow along with the major movies ', ' this fantastic film has spectacular balance of the inevitable darkness of natasha history comedy and action it is one of my favourite marvel movies and don understand how it has such low ratings ', ' this show is terrible see lot of people getting mad at giving it 1 but too many are also giving it 10 regardless the one thing that is trying to be pushed is the girl background by all means show it but the number one thing should be to make good storyline with deep characters this is clearly not if that was done and just keep whatever her background is that would have been totally respected just like miles morales of course some will call me hater m not just realist this character had few series fail over the last few years ', ' marvel is changing up their formula and adding more politics worldview and agenda instead of just great movies and storytelling must be disneys doing this would be good minus the crazy amount of culture pushing they are trying to do here the script feels lazy and plot doesn land casting is decent but again it feels missed because they are trying to do to much instead of just tell story quit pushing agendas and just make good movie let people think for themselves disney is not the hero ', ' 20 for samuel jackson 18 for brie larson boring uninspired cashgrab good luck buying tickets from yourself disney ', ' thought captain marvel would be the last worst marvel would do but they prove me wrong with that last black widow nothing like we expected the kinda of action we know black widow for is absent really bad character development they literally wasted every single one of the new characters in that movie the screenplay and storyline are obviously the worst so simple basic nothing really entertaining same old stuff we see every single time first marvel movie was impatient for it to end just don get how disney is making around 60m with disney and 150m in theater with that disappointment of movie would recommend only for educational purpose just to know what happened but it wont affect in any way your understanding of marvel storyline since the movie is after civil war events and black widow died in end game so if you don want to watch it it really fine deeply regret those 2h of my life mean since end game don get what marvel is trying to do with wandavision captain america and the winter soldier or loki really don get it except making money cause the effort put on those stories are really poor it nothing like everything before end game except captain marvel that was hard to watch really hope they ll stop thinking about money they already have and focus on what kind of story they re giving out there ', ' well this was certainly much awaited movie of this summer had lot of expectations from it and it delivered even more my friend had no knowledge of avengers and he went out with me in the end he clapped with the audience now about the movie just one word to explain it its entertaining its long movie but it kept us stick to our seat din realize when it ends the strong point of this movie is its humor every characters are funny in their own way esp tony stark don want to tell you the story you yourself watch it watch it even if you are not comic man you will enjoy it ', ' put simply ms marvel in the comics was good cause she superhero who just happens to also be pakistani the mcu ms marvel sucks because she a pakistani who just happens to also be superhero as massive ms marvel comics fan they nailed her casting but destroyed her story and changed her actual powers really hate disney for this with passion knew it was gonna happen as soon as heard that instead of hiring an actual experienced director with talented crew they limited their hiring to only those of pakistani descent and that immediately was the nail in the coffin didn even matter if the cast or crew had even read the comics or had any experience creating similar scripted tv shows or superhero content before they just had to be pakistani like wow disney thanks for using my race as an excuse to destroy the story of the only superhero from my race also feel bad for the actress iman cause they nailed her casting but gave her literally the worst storyline and script to work with honestly couldn have cared less if the cast and crew were all white male and felons if they could ve written an actually decent storyline that didn make her entire shtick just about her being pakistani would ve prefered it ', ' first of all never give anything 10 because that means perfection and giving the movie 9 also leaves some kind of room for improvement for any potential future avengers movies with that in mind may even give this 9 5 after movies such as spiderman being disappointment and having the newest batman series to compare to the avengers wasn sure what to expect also taking into consideration that the latest marvel movies such as the men origin movies and individual avengers ironman 1 and 2 thor hulk seeming to have fairly good ratings or at least good movies to me was almost curious if this was going to be disappointment after streak of good movies at the same time usually walk into movies with low expectations so if it is let down m not as let down as other people are however with this movie couldn help but to have higher expectation seeing previous marvel movies so being really excited for this movie during and after the movie was thrilled with it it blew my mind and seriously felt like kid in awe and they did so well taking childhood characters and making it possible to be watched by any age for the tough critics if you are not fan of comic book superheros or just not fan of any of the marvel dc movies would recommend this film if was to try to change your mind know some who were let down by thor and or captain america and couple people who were slightly disappointed by iron man then believe the avengers movie will fully redeem those disappointments for you if you also haven seen any of the individual avengers movies thor ironman 1 2 captain america hulk it not an absolute much to watch do believe it sure does help though so if you re going to see any movie this year this will be great one to watch ', ' watched the movie last night if there is an imax theater in your area recommend it liked the effects and the atmosphere it felt let get to the movie the movie introduces the subject quickly which may make some viewers feel like it already fait accompli in fact since it is the sequel to captain marvel it is very normal for it to start fast mcu followers will not be unfamiliar with the subject anyway the duration of the film is ideal if it were longer the dialogue scenes would be longer note there is only one after credit scene at the end of the movie there is no second scene you do not have to wait you may feel little different after the after credit scene ', ' ve just came out of cinema and to share with you my thoughts why because really don understand all this situation about the movie and brie larson can understand why many people got angry for her speach which was taken last summer yes she was uncorrected in her words and maybe she should apologize but come on anybody can be wrong no needs to blame her in all sins and brake the movie rating judge the movie not the actress s capitan marvel was awesome carol danvers it a badass emotional girl with her own interesting character and hope that in future we will get close to her p marvel studios want to see goose in the future please ', ' don know why everyone is hating on this show other than the fact that she not white superhero news flash there are tons of superheroes that are different races and religions as well as women m not diehard super hero fan like some but loved this show and that it showed other religions and the history of pakistani people the only fault found was that the actress playing kamala wasn great at first but she grew on me and as this is her first job think she did okay but it definitely felt like the other actors actresses pulled the show along ', ' what cars 2 is to pixar the marvels is to the mcu captain marvel was arguably the weakest mcu addition at the time of its release the sequel is much much worse the marvels feel like one of the cheaper disney tv shows stitch together to the length of movie everything about it is subpar cringe dialogues terrible cgi infantile script the movie is all over the place to the point that it feels like bunch of 12 year old boys stitch up the plot together on one of their afternoon play dates after quantumania love and thunder and now this mcu seems to be heading in the same direction as the f series disney should stop focusing on forced diversity and start saving its most valuable ip ', ' this has to be one of the worst tv shows of all time and its about the comics reed all the time stupid kids have no idea what acting is its pretty much like they said hey heres 90 000 episode you don have to do anything apart from say whats on the script its not even about the core of h e d its just again bloody kids if it was going to be about the actual shield it would be roped around nick fury and most of his assistants we all know and love if marvel wanted to make good show the would have done it on lesser none character such as black panther even ant man instead of making movie marvel has dropped the ball so hard in the last couple of years and it may will be disney pulling the strings on everything don watch this ', ' the only marvel show that continues to get better with each season the acting was on point loved the story line between fisk and matt every one of the side stories was interesting fisk is portrayed perfectly matt gets better with every season ', ' im happy that cap got sequal she deserved it and of course its always wonderful to see the beautfiul brie larson grace my tv screen again its been some time now and captain marvel is trying to ajust to the new life around her her nice monika is an astronaut after last seeing her in wandervision lot has happened and now she has powers but along with these two marvels there is also miss marvel in the form of kamela shes pretty great addtion and is fun to watch liiked the fighting scenes with them switching places it was well choreographed the additional flurkins were very cute great cast and overall lot better than the last couple of mcu movies ', ' ve yet to see movie based on comic book character that deserves more than 1 or 2 stars this one is beyond belief good cgi that true but the film is an endless succession of clich scarlett will look back in few years and be ashamed of being in such film some of the action scenes seem to have been thought by 5 year old the terrible villain uses some sort of super energy to turn good people into bad people but knock on the head just brings them back how simple how convenient see it if you can handle 2 and half hours of predictable senseless and bad entertainment time much better spent on good walk on the park imdb 8 2 you gotta be kidding ', ' loved the first episode ms marvel is amazing adaptation of the comics it perfectly captured the style of the comics and hopefully will be great start to more diverse additions to the mcu love how this isn a carbon copy of the cgi fights and male driven storylines we have literally seen in every other marvel movie this show isn made for 40 year old dudes and film bros it made for the younger generation of marvel fans it their turn to have the spotlight with diverse stories about their lives you don have to relate to being 16 year old pakistani girl to appreciate this show and if your own biases stop you from enjoy this side of the marvel comic world then your more than welcome to skip this show my favourite part of the episode was the relationship kamala has with her friends and family and the struggles she has with balancing her passions with her family expectations the aesthetic design of the show feels like your waking in comic page with bright colours and 2d drawings coming to life kinda reminds me of spider man into the spider verse can wait to see more of how she will wield this new power she found love the direction phase 4 is going with the marvel tv shows so far and hopefully you will too ', ' this is truly fantastic film the acting is great and nearly every scene was truly spectacular there are not many settings in the movie which is what ve always wanted in movie and the movie really focuses on the plot there were no additional useless scenes which makes you think of how much of tremendous work was put into this film don really think there really anything else to say about this movie if you haven seen this movie yet you better go see it it truly marvelous it not disappointment it is movie worth money fabulous job marvel and disney hope the sequel will be as great as this one ', ' the movie seemed like it tried to cram three black window movies in to one couldn tell if it seemed like there was too many or too little antagonists but overall pretty solid solo movie it is forgivable coming off of the last 2 movies being endgame and far from home as said solid movie though ', ' oh dude the cringe level of this one is waaaay above bearable her facial expressions are between bad jim carrey on very bad day and hailee steinfeld when she thinks she is good actress but actually she is very far from that horrible kinda understand it was made for 8 10 years olds but are they really this dumb does her character and this acting really relatable for anyone these forced lame jokes and arabic clich are really not offending anyone am not middle eastern but even feel bad watching it ', ' never thought d rec bad movie but this movie is fun and hilarious some of the scenes are so wacky that they re low key quite creative and was honestly impressed the movie itself is kind of all over the place and couldn tell you what the plot is but it good to have on in the background because the funny scenes are hilarious the actress playing the teen is hilarious and makes me feel old but also love gen kids lol giving this an 8 10 purely bc think it worth watching if you want light ridiculous movie not bc it an actual 8 10 please have good taste in movies lol ', ' good show for building bridges it could be bit more fast paced it takes while for the story to unfold and feel it could ve been done better but overall it great ', ' worst mcu movie maybe normally don give negative review as like to see something positive from the movie but this one was waste of time there was no reason to release this movie now after endgame plot is near to none half of the time you will not understand why there is too much of action first half of movie is too boring second half is at least watchable wandavision loki are much better than this movie ', ' m generally joss whedon fan but this film is truly awful now before m pilloried by the marvel fanboys let me explain why 1 the first hour of the film is spent gradually very gradually at points reintroducing characters from the previous marvel character films which this is to be expected it happens not in any organic way but in very perfunctory forced manner by introducing the crisis immediately as the film begins this is disconcerting for number of reasons not the least of which is because it leaves you very little room to go up from there there no build up to the introduction of the enemy it just there 2 for all of this often needless exposition there is little if any character development within the first half of the film which left me feeling cold towards any of the main characters just don care if they die kill em all 3 because the action starts at the beginning and doesn really stop every moment of exposition feels like it takes year just to get going what is often intended to be humorous springy dialogue is delivered in scenes that are utilitarian at best and just leaden mill stones at worst the script is well written and the actors do very serviceable jobs delivering their well written lines but the truth is that because the movie started with action and kept going no one really cares what they have to say will it entertain some people yes but frankly it just not worth paying monthly subscription to watch on netflix much less purchase it to own ', ' usually watch series on tv after referring to imdb primarily and did the same with this one looking at crazy 8 rating but was utterly disappointed and bored every series catches pace with seasons and this one slowed down and so much weightage and power to fisk that the show would ve made sense named fisk instead of daredevil super hero who gets weaker with seasons and the last season he doesn even have one and keeps getting beaten up by normal man who just super strong their law firm can do any good the daredevil can do any good they can save anyone or anything with blind goal of getting fisk arrested through all seasons only for him to be stronger and come screw everyone ', ' this has to be the worst marvel film ever made even worse than the failing fantastic 4 films even worse than the dc movies black widow is just boring character never liked her in avengers so this stand alone film was always going to be awful ', ' one of the worst marvel movies out there did any of the producers actually see this movie before release the level of cringe drama sets new record high make sure before deciding to watch this that ou won get that time back ever ', ' first of all the negative reviews this show has been getting led me to think that the tv adaptation of the antihero of marvel comics whose character was always almost realistic was dull and boring one but m surprised to find that it was not only entertaining but the best adaptation of the punisher ever they say its long and boring but wasn bored for even second everything the show is is exactly how it should be mean its an origin story it should show how he turned up as this ruthless brutal vigilante as we all knew it is slow paced action thriller with brilliant screenplay the directors did their part the acting was perfect one can never miss jon bernthal magnificent acting never knew that this guy had this much potential give this guy the right material and he ll bring you an oscar the subplots with lewis and all was amazing actually its frank castle tv show rather than the punisher it clearly depicts the mental tension faced by soldiers the state of mistaking the battlefield as their home and the tendency to once again to get back into action overall the tv show has so much potential as we can see there is more to come more ass kicking to see and the season however ends with hint at what to expect in the possible next season so can wait for the next one ', ' it all over the place very messy continuity in the storyline nick fury seems to be playing caricature of yourself carol denvers takes backseat in her own sequel it genuinely looks like huge chunks of the movie were cut the movie has some fun moments iman vellani performance is alright and the vfx aren bad but overall it just very painful to watch and just mostly below average 2 3 incomprehensibly unlikable leads nonsensical script and woefully incompetent director are why this movie is such failure the latest marvel film arrives in jumbled and scattered manner leaving little to entertain you with the cats were good though ', ' this has got to be the most stupid marvel movie to date great cgi however poor acting and childish storyline that made me roll my eyes over and over again ', ' m not the biggest fan of either comics or marvel productions but can surely appreciate good series that has many amazing and unexpected elements such as compelling story that keeps you interested great acting along with likable characters but best of all is the realistic action sequences that have yet to see in most movies or films very grounded and just precise camera work rather than special effects cgi this show should be highly recommended but hear from others that it can bore them bit from the beginning did not mind do not want to compare daredevil to other superhero shows however it does set high bar each of the netflix solo series are quite awesome in their own way and are usually more one genre before being superhero related which is dope direction for filming and it breaks lot of clich ', ' the story was disinteresting and the action over the top these are girls not gods if thunder they should be in intensive care after the first 30 minutes ', ' this is one of the best action films have ever seen but it not the best superhero or comic book movie ever bests are tdk sin city and history of violence to me anyways m being very nitpicky here so when say some things m not saying it a bad movie loved it it just that it could have been better and speaking being better the film could have done more on thor and loki relationship thor is very underplayed here as character he is wiser and cooler than the last film but he has no character or chemistry between others sure there are some scenes where loki and thor are doing shakespeare in the park but it could have gotten lot somber er or emotional to us plus loki was very one dimensional here his goal is very stupid and am actually glad that whedon took note of that but he could have at least try to make loki interesting he is cool and all but his objectives are so pointless he basically joke in this film whedon could have made him lot more terrifying and less cheesy although whedon goal probably was cheesy for this film the scene where black widow is interrogating loki is awesome he should have been more like that he really threatening but he also an indirect comic relief another problem had with this film was the dialog there were lot of funny lines but whedon could have done sooo much better the dialog for cabin in the woods was just fantastic it could ve been like that here but it just became corny all the serious lines are sooo corny and sometimes unbearable and although there are some negatives whedon does do great job at sometimes making some corny scenes pretty funny and those are my negatives about this movie m not going to write lot about the awesome things about this movie because ll be repeating what everyone has said yes this film is beautiful yes it is action packed fun yes it is funny but if had to add anything else whedon did terrifically by making this film feel right it a movie for everyone definitely recommend everyone to see it it a wonderful film it doesn have an amazing story to tell and in fact the story is very commonplace it like indiana jones seven samurais everyone will enjoy this film 8 5 10 ', ' m huge fan of the punisher comic books so was little wary of live action version given previous disappointments was impressed with how the introduction of the character in daredevil contained scenes straight out of the comic the punisher tv series also didn disappoint think the casting of jon bernthal was perfect and he plays the role brilliantly although not completely true to the written version the tv version of frank castle and his story is enjoyable and brutal and look forward to watching season 2 ben barnes is also great as billy the beaut russo aka jigsaw ', ' if you re looking for fun time at the movies this weekend look no further there was just tremendous amount of hype for the film mean couldn go anywhere or do anything without seeing some sort of ad but m very happy to say they met my high expectations and then some firstly the bad stuff the first half of the film is bit too slowly paced felt whedon spent bit too much time on ramp up and origin story especially when each of the important characters had their own origin film for that purpose maybe he felt the need to do so because not everyone would ve seen the other films but as someone who made the time to see them felt this was unnecessary once things picked up in the second half it was definitely worth the wait there quite lot lot to love here there are some fantastic action sequences and battles pretty much the whole second half few moments where you just say that was awesome surprisingly frequent number of laugh out loud moments my crowd even had few spontaneous outbursts of clapping as well the script was very cleverly written and the story was engaging albeit very simple there something for everyone here it amazing the film was almost 2 5 hours long because it didn feel like it dragged slowly paced start withstanding and felt that whedon did great job at allowing each character adequate screen time for you to be connected to them this is rare feet in films where there are so many characters as it very hard to do yet whedon handled this perfectly didn feel there was single character who didn belong or was just filler see the men films every character was necessary every character played pivotal role every character meant something again can say enough of how much appreciated this loved the performances robert downey jr was once again brilliant as iron man and really is the most interesting character in the film he steals virtually every scene he in sam jackson puts in stellar turn once again as nick fury chris hemworth and mark ruffalo were on point as well but the surprise for me was chris evans as captain america really was disappointed in last summer captain america and felt he was miscast because he didn feel as authoritative as expected captain america to be and not as grizzled or mature but he was clearly much better here as actually believed him this time around than in the origin film combined with the other performances really felt this lifted the film be sure to stick around after the credits although really you should have this figured out by now it a marvel staple there not one but two extra scenes to be seen the 2nd of which is quite hilarious while it not at the level of the dark knight it pretty damn good as stuff gonna blow up summer film it just great way to start off the summer movie season hopefully the rest of the summer lives up this head out to your nearest multiplex get your popcorn ready and enjoy this action gem for more of my reviews and general movie discussion check out my blog http andretms blogspot ca ', ' this movie was good movie it had good base but it simply wasn this game changing movie that people seem to think it is it just one of those action packed no intellect required movies for this to be 34 in the top movies of all time is shameful m sure many people can think of 250 movies that re far superior to this one the acting itself was fine although it did seem little awkward at times the dialogue did get extremely cheesy although it was good cheesy but good cheesy doesn cut it in 8 movie altogether if you re looking for one of those visually striking entertaining movies go see this one but don expect to be awestruck when you leave again good but not amazing ', ' must confess that m not really massive fan of the comic book movies don normally go and see them at the cinema but someone dragged me along to watch avengers assemble the plot is predictably simple with an alien enemy threatening security on earth this means that team of superheroes are required to defeat the enemy the superheroes that are recruited include iron man hulk thor captain america hawkeye and the black widow the thing that disliked about the film is the fact that didn really care whether any of the characters survived or perished there are plenty of funny one liners in the style of the bond one liners it also appears that the actors had good time making the film scarlett johansson looks particularly good in cat suit throughout the movie the guy that dragged me along to the movie absolutely adored the film so if you are into comic book movies m sure you ll have blast ', ' when first saw the promo for this film airing on the disney channel was excited it seemed to have fresh perspective on the young heroes trope and overall looked decent watched this film recently on disney xd and from what ve seen it was quite underwhelming the story tone and pacing weren too bad the show kind of looks fine and the overall feel is somewhat refreshing the problem the characters are bit dull and leave little impact and the story of young team fighting for justice just feels rehashed and done before it almost like disney marvel take on teen titans or young justice but not in refreshing unique way more like in paint by the numbers rehash seen there been there kind of way while don think this film is the absolute worst nor amongst the worst of marvel it certainly wasn one liked wanted to like this movie but all the way felt myself yawning and pretty disappointed wanted to see more of spider gwen like how we did in marvel rising initiation predecessor to this film however this film isn the best but it isn completely terrible it just rehashed average film that been done before and in better ways really wanted to like this one but by trying to be too much at once and not adding its own spin on trope that been done so many times before it becomes below average experience to watch do applaud the team for changing up the art style bit and giving us something to work with however it still gets score of 5 6 10 average it looks like promising marvel film but turns out to be yet another average tv film from disney and marvel entertainment believe you can do better than this disney marvel still have faith in you legofan ', ' can get over the amount of creative shots and sequences in the first episode alone the pacing is slightly slow but the fun characters make up for it easily also great to see pakistani character but that doesn affect the score ', ' let just say that the story arc for medani totally shocked the out of me the entire cast have delivered bravura performances and the writing this year has been great am sitting here hoping for series 3 oh please give us series 3 and 4 and 5 maybe even bring back daredevil and luke cage know jessica jones is coming back so here hoping if there ever was bunch of shows worth continuing it these the give us something we don get on regular television and that is quality excitement and charisma ', ' expected great marvel movie but no it was kinda boring feel disappointed ', ' there are not many films that are good enough in my opinion to make me go and see it five times at the cinemas however from start to finish the avengers was an excellent example of how to develop reasonably detailed plot line whilst maintaining an unrelenting series of action sequences the chemistry between each of the already well established characters was fantastic getting good balance of all personalities with wholesome and righteous from captain america sarcastic and nonchalant from iron man zen and rage from bruce banner they really managed to cover all the sides of human emotion and hero stereotypes at the end of the day if you want the most unexpected ground shattering storyline with serious real life connections tho may not be the best movie for you however if you want brilliantly laid out series of action sequence funny one liner small plot development action sequence action sequence and bigger action sequence this movie is going to rock your world ', ' as pakistani this show is the best representation have ever seen of pakistan girl and family it felt like show about me the music outfits dialogues and characters were sooo spot on the first episode has me hooked and already know this will be my favorite marvel show by far am so excited for the rest of the episodes and to see how the show plays out ', ' was just bored directed by woman which is fine but this felt like hallmark movie with few explosions not horrible but not one ll return to ', ' the beginning had ppossibilities then it just fell flat black widow was side kick and it just seemed that she didn need to be in the movie the action was so forced and the cgi was dreadful complete waste of time ', ' in light of the fun and fame of the avengers the show about the agents of shield looks pretty lame and average strictly aimed at kids it could improve but doubt it will and some things have better to be hidden and stay behind closed doors with so many shows and even better alternatives out where don give the agents many chances to become series will follow for very long am sorry would have loved little action fun in front of the tv but now just wonder and almost don give dame not marvelous or memorable in any way with great powers comes little or no results ', ' this movie was an absolute disappointment from start to finish it failed to engage or entertain the plot felt disjointed and poorly developed leaving me confused and disconnected from the characters motivations the acting was subpar with performances that lacked depth and emotional resonance the dialogue was clich and cringe worthy making it difficult to take any of the characters seriously the cinematography was uninspired and the special effects looked outdated the pacing was painfully slow and found myself checking my watch repeatedly hoping for some semblance of redeeming moment even the soundtrack failed to salvage the viewing experience as it felt mismatched and out of touch with the film supposed tone overall this movie was regrettable waste of time and would strongly advise against anyone subjecting themselves to such lackluster cinematic experience ', ' the marvels 2023 may feel like relatively minor mcu but it honestly better than quite few of marvel other recent projects it getting bad rap seemingly because superhero fatigue is settling in as it really no worse than or all that different to any of the other lesser yet still enjoyable entries in its wider series its poor box office performance isn really anything to do with the movie itself as the weak marketing campaign has meant that lot of people just don seem know it actually out and those who do would rather catch it on disney when it inevitably drops there in couple of months speaking of the soon to be more expensive streaming service the picture does kind of feel like something that ought to have premiered straight on the small screen it not that it bad but rather that something seems ever so slightly off about the whole endeavour the narrative never quite gels together into something truly cohesive or indeed essential the parts are all there and the to to of it all lines up perfectly fine but lot of it feels like it retreading old ground and the newer elements don really get all that much time to shine for example some scenes play out like the culminations to character arcs that just aren in the film however despite its legitimate rough patches and general haziness that gets all the more prevalent in retrospect the picture is quite bit of throwaway fun once it gets going this is mainly thanks to the compelling central concept that sees the three heroes switch places whenever two or more of them try to use their powers at the same time this leads to couple of really entertaining action sequences that are impressively choreographed and consistently kinetic with the first major switching fight being the highlight of the entire affair the other major reason the piece works as well as it does is iman vellani whose kamala kahn is an absolute delight whenever she on screen the enthusiasm of the character seems to stem from the genuine enthusiasm of the actor this energy seeps out of the screen and straight into your heart putting smile on your face whenever ms marvel gets moment in the spotlight the other two leads brie larson captain marvel and teyonah parris professor marvel are both solid as well don get me wrong and the supportive dynamic between the three main characters holds the story aloft even in its weaker moments the youngest of the trio is clearly the most endearing though and kind of wish the piece had focused more on her as proper sequel to her series the villain is very weak and some elements of her plan don quite line up but she does what she needs to and acts as formidable foe for the good guys without threatening to steal single scene from them the other side characters including kamala family and nick fury are as enjoyable as they ve ever been and raise the quality of what could have been fairly weak plot as does certain cat like creature ultimately this really isn a bad effort it perfectly serviceable popcorn entertainment that competently constructed from familiar materials even if it lacks the style of some of director nia dacosta other work it as fun as it is forgettable an enjoyable if undeniably minor entry in an ever expanding cinematic universe it pretty good and it certainly better than you may expect given its generally poor reception ', ' every episode builds beautifully on the previous thickening the plot and facilitating rich character development slower start that focuses on family relationships seems to have dissuaded fans of the marvel universe that expect nonstop action patience is rewarded ', ' ve been seeing lot of articles mentioning this is the best marvel show yet ummm no like that it diverse and they tried something new with the animation but that not enough to make it the best it really feels like cheesy disney channel teenage angst show m going to hang as long as can but these kids are too dopey this is even more juvenile than hawkeye the dialogue is awful too m hoping for redemption by the end of the series ', ' with the high budget this film had should not be noticing the staging ok mark you stand there and look annoyed but knowing scarlett look like you re pondering chris focus on keeping some of the accent but not all of it there was no scene in the film where didn see with my mind eye the director on set barking stage direction perhaps if the script had been stronger wouldn have noticed but pair weak script with long series of obviously staged and very non dynamic scenes and you end up with more flat scenes than can count character development with this cadre of fun and interesting actors and the huge budget that hired them you think you end up with quality oozing out of the screen no robert downey stark was one note snarkie and that it few fun lines but zero cleverness and no depth the same with the rest of them except for mark and scarlet they were the only two who created anything interesting with their parts and of these two mark created genuinely interesting character in banner cgi big budgets mean you shouldn notice the cgi in one scene in particular it was obvious that the actors were in front of green screen with the cgi added later they should blend into the cgi not stand apart and obviously in front of it script could the script have been more plodding and obvious it was not smart or clever script it read like comic book perhaps that all marvel can do well ', ' it about time the pakistani culture got accurately represented in film and disney has exceeded my expectations and done superb job with ms marvel every character has been cast perfectly and the the storyline is uniquely modern and captivating it a great series for the whole family to watch and there a character everyone from every generation can identify with m so in love with the characters and this story hope disney makes more films and series like this to represent world cultures ', ' never thought this movie would be this boring action sequences are pretty bad also you don feel anything towards the characters could have been an amazing action movie ', ' daredevil premise is loosely based on events that have happened in the mcu in the past specifically avengers in one of the shots of ben urich one of my favorite characters office there are front pages from both the battle of new york avengers and one of the hulk from his stint of destruction in movie that happened so long ago d forgotten they considered it canonical there are mentions of other things like wesley my favorite character of this season vague descriptions of thor and ironman which are shown in one of the trailers other than little hints there is nothing in the show that has been explained elsewhere that is pertinent to your enjoyment 4 is it better than daredevil 2003 yes was more or less comfortable with the daredevil myths going in so can speak very much to the ease in which they introduce information except that there is still more to learn about matt murdock past even though the season is concluded there are allusions to the future story lines of season 2 for those looking for the mystical story line it really doesn pick up except in episode 7 also elektra is teased for fans of elektra but is identifiable as major plot point for season 2 under the assumption they get season two which obviously think they deserve even foggy mentions her in flashback m assuming here there may be connection m simply wanting to make while the battlin jack murdock story line is somewhat interesting m glad it was no longer than what it was it stayed it welcome and left with enough reverential nods to the fact his dad was major part of his life to cut it off villains wesley is solid character and personally the best villainous character on the show he not great at being villain he just gopher in all due respect but he witty and he can get down to blood spurting business when he needs to the russians early main protagonists they are stereotypical but very weird and interesting the brotherly bond is about the only character development they have though vladimir gets little more interesting as time goes on wilson fisk feel like he simply okay which might be problem for some people early on really dug him and he was one of the reasons kept watching so vehemently however feel like vincent onofrio gave up the ruse of playing troubled character into playing villain in the back half of the season which is weird considering his arc at that point he specifically makes choice with his voice making it more cartoon it just through me off in what was otherwise really cool performance solid cast and don hate anyone except maybe vanessa but personal preference rosario dawson as claire temple was my stand out favorite early on in the series but have feeling there was scheduling conflict or they couldn pay her enough for the story they included her in vondie curtis hall as ben urich was my number two automatically and like his arch and his character and his pizazz foggy is fair and well cast in elden henson he funny when he supposed to be and was more than adequate in the dramatic scenes there is bit midway through the back half when felt he and karen were little whiny but think that was the writers and not the actors karen was good but must admit have soft spot for deborah ann woll so take this with grain of salt karen character connected with other sub characters lot better than someone like foggy and felt she was integral to exploring those plots most of the time out of the three members of nelson and murdock foggy definitely has his place firmly set in the firm which miffed me when the writers weren letting him do lawyer things charlie cox does great job with his american accent and even though there are small times when hear him irishing up at the end of sentence he is supposed to be somewhat irish not enough to have any accent whatsoever but let me have this one he not red headed at all but his acting as matt murdock is solid would have liked to see them make the blindness more believable and think they had this brought up to them because they keep needing to have the characters remind us he is blind ll take this time to mention the child actor playing young matt in the flashbacks did great job daredevil was solid investment in solid story as fan of dc comics and the marvel cinematic universe this along with arrow really fill that inward need of having live action batman show on television think that the dark tones of this show with the focus on crime instead of strictly super villains really fit what would want out of batman year one type tv show which makes sense because this is more or less an adaptation of frank miller man without fear there is enough grit and violence to really instill sense of mortality in this world for me if broken protruding bones freak you out would recommend watching with friend who can tell you when to look back at the screen look forward to jessica jones which comes next in the defender series ', ' just watched captain marvel last night and it was big boring letdown it ll be one superhero movie ll probably never rewatch went into the cinema hoping to see an mcu version of wonder woman instead what got was paint by number effort with no real effort to distinguish itself it not bad movie it just boring wonder woman has rating of 7 5 on imdb and captain marvel is 7 1 as m writing this this is doing massive disservice to wonder woman wonder woman has great characters action humour pacing resounding music scores enthralling fight scenes captain marvel has little of those and made worse by brie larson inability to emote as carol danvers her expression is just one big meh ', ' if you have been fan of the core marvel studios films since 2008 iron man where the beginnings of the avengers initiative were first teased and carried through into the 2010 sequel as well as the incredible hulk thor and captain america the first avenger then the avengers will not disappoint in fact it very well might make you question why the other franchise films weren as good as this fast paced funny superhero showdown marvel has been very focused and dedicated with the development of its properties under the disney banner and they no doubt wish that the spider man and men franchises could return to their fold as it was the success of these earlier films that brought marvel comics out of bankruptcy and has been providing solid entertainment from its creators and stars alike by odin beard sir kenneth branagh directed thor enter joss whedon who created weekly tv show in buffy the vampire slayer that was near perfect example of live action comic book to deliver heavily anticipated yet so easy to fail production of getting such diverse character set in movie that worked and worked it did the film gets off to slow and even somewhat murky start as loki thor mischievous half brother played with anthony hopkins worthy sneer by tom hiddleston appears escapes from and is responsible for the destruction of shield hq as well as the spiriting away of few supporting characters including stellan skarsgard dr selvig also of thor and jeremy renner hawkeye getting the full movie treatment here all under the semi impotent glare of samuel jackson one eyed spy nick fury obiously loki never saw samuel s wallet from another film the movie picks up with the re introduction of scarlett johansson black widow as whedon has some fun showing what moves he could have presented in buffy if he had an avengers sized budget backing him up but it truly gets bright when the three protagonists iron man captain america thor finally appear and of course get into wrestling match to prove who has the biggest repulsor shield hammer once the team finally assembles insanity and the hilarity that often follows ensues oh and mark ruffalo proves that the hulk can indeed smash joss whedon adept skills he also writes the screenplay prove to be the other superhero powerhouse as he successfully created production that pleases the hardcore fanboy who is aware of thanos the mainstream movie audience who thinks that tony and pepper are destined for each other and his own loyal core fan base of browncoats each hero gets their own time to shine in situations worthy of comicbook splash page the rough up dust up of third act that entirely deals with the assembled team involved in street level brawl in nyc against what else an invading alien army could very well have became tedious as admittedly the obligatory interstellar menace is faceless forgettable and seemingly invented for the sales of action figures but the action humor and allure of these powerful heroes is truly something unique and that magic is perfectly captured on the screen 2008 saw the release of both iron man and warner bros dark knight the result was that both films set the bar that future genre films would have to follow in 2012 that bar was set yet again what remains to be seen is if the upcoming dark knight rises film as well as the sequels for iron man thor and captain america will continue to raise that bar or if they will all just assemble ', ' marvel daredevil is real marvel it is netflix original and currently available on netflix instant download streaming the actors include charlie cox deborah ann woll elden henson vincent onofrio toby leonard moore vondie curtis hall bob gunton ayelet zurer and roce johnson it is the marvel comics characters coming to life in color and surround sound just as desired by the many fans of this genre it is directed by phil abraham and farren blackburn writers include bill everet drew goddard stan lee steven deknight douglas patrie gene colan luke kalteux roger mckenzie joe pokaski marco ramirez and johnny romita the story is that of blind attorney matt murdock and his colleague foggy nelson of the firm by the same name who are out to save the city of new york from the forces of evil that lurk in the shadows gave it 9 stars dale haufrect ', ' this movie has many objectives to achieve at least for me 1 building hype for the endgame 2 introduction of capt marvel 3 introduction of nick fury for me all objectives are achieved didn notice that brie acting is bad at all from being uncertain of her powers to being empowered by them she shown great range of acting she has an oscar after all young nick and old nick of course has different personality for me they are not totally different it like see how my young dad becoming old of course bit of him changing but it still him anyway m hyped for endgame and wish to credits are different 2 credits tho they are not world changing credits but plz sit ur ass down ', ' morale of the movie is men bad ladies good too much talking emotion ray winstone is awful in this his russian accent is terrible taskmaater is just another rubbish marvel villain feels like this is just too little too late ', ' loved the first episode kamala is funny and the actress is very charismatic it really different from other mcu series and think it great because you don get bored with the same stuff all the time actually m really happy to see an adhd character saw lot of myself in her and it a very pleasant surprise can wait to see the next episodes ', ' sure the special effects are amazing if you remember the ff movies that are just decade old they appear now totally outmoded if you compare with the transformers that are more recent sure the movie is better visualized it isn a change of shoot each second it more focused about the characters and less on pure crazy action thus you can follow what happens sure the casting is experimented and it was cool to see that johnny storm has become steve rogers as the actor was really cool in the aforementioned ff movies sure it has some good lines about legolas real understanding of those icons example hulk trying to move thor hammer original new mysteries who are the shadow people sure it adapts one of the best comics stories the super hero who turns bad and destroys shielb base was millar enemy of the state and all this for only 4 yes because the first hour is totally boring have even slept in this black night also because the screenwriter of super heroes lacks the talent of the comics writer stan the man who invented the avengers could tell the same story in 22 pages it was fast easy to understand here the plot is unintelligible uses and abuses of scientific concepts and stupid name tesserac also because have the feeling to have missed movie what about the story about black widow and hawkeye also because the alien invasion is just destroy for destroy so the last hour is an astounding but hollow action scene in conclusion it finally better than daredevil but faraway of the classic raimi spiderman ', ' ve been eagerly awaiting black widow movie since paramount picked up the rights before the mcu even existed while the first half of the movie has some strong beats and hits the mark in some ways the second half of the movie really goes off the rails what should have been very grounded spy thriller forgets what it is and becomes superhero film the cast is excellent but the story just doesn feel like it was crafted by people that understood the character very disappointing ', ' m not bug fan of the mcu have seen some of the movies but not all of them really liked this one as an origin story it had unexpected twists and turns larsen and jackson really did have chemistry and the supporting actors did good job what shone through and really made it worth watching was how they conveyed the sense of hope that is essential to good superhero movie ', ' have in sense religiously watched all marvel movies and shows m marvel fanboy or shill if you will this show made me finally feel the superhero fatigue that everyone proclaimed back in the infinity saga definitely feel it now especially with the disney plus shows and ms marvel felt like the nail in the coffin loved ms marvel in the comics and was extremely excited for this show wanting to go in loving it and tried the show feels so tonally confused with being family show teen show culture show and marvel universe show it doesn fulfill or flesh out on any of these points it feels like it could ve been separated into two seasons and should ve fleshed out each plot point some have said it felt too childish even spider man homecoming at times felt childish but the coming of age story in that felt more solid as it focused on one strong narrative with characters and villains fully fleshed out can say the same for here this has become my least favorite disney series ', ' saw it while back and forgot to review it then so no longer remember the details and will keep it short still thought it worth giving my impression captain marvel as disney princess is an amazing idea having her be princess of planet where everyone communicates with song and dance is to me stroke of genius and deserves movie of its own showing how she became that instead of just small section not that trust disney writers to do this justice even if it appeared and apologies to anyone who feels cheated over this because marked this review as not containing spoilers felt it not too much of spoiler even if it the only part of the movie that felt was special unfortunately beyond this this is movie that answers question nobody asked what would happen if every person had the mind of 12 year old girl so while the movie has some action and some humour and not least kittens it was basically cringe ', ' the storyline make no sens acting is horrible wasted 2 hours ', ' avengers is 2012 american superhero film based on the marvel comics superhero team of the same name produced by marvel studios and distributed by walt disney studios motion pictures 1 it is the sixth installment in the marvel cinematic universe the film is written and directed by joss whedon and features an ensemble cast including robert downey jr chris evans mark ruffalo chris hemsworth scarlett johansson jeremy renner tom hiddleston clark gregg cobie smulders stellan skarsg rd and samuel jackson in the film nick fury director of the peacekeeping organization h e d recruits iron man captain america the hulk and thor to form team that must stop thor adoptive brother loki from subjugating earth the film development began when marvel studios received loan from merrill lynch in april 2005 after the success of the film iron man in may 2008 marvel announced that the avengers would be released in july 2011 with the signing of johansson in march 2009 the film was pushed back for 2012 release whedon was brought on board in april 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by zak penn production began in april 2011 in albuquerque new mexico before moving to cleveland ohio in august and new york city in september the film was converted to 3d in post production ', ' don know why didn like this series maybe got bored watching superhero series movies you can watch it if you want ', ' terrible writing predictable and bad direction total waste of time ', ' an entirely pointless film that was made to fit ever strengthening toxic agenda the writing and acting was abysmal other than brie larson no new ideas seems to be that marvel are just milking the cash cow after each release with this as no exception as positive would say that it a better production than ms marvel and she hulk but that obviously wasn difficult seems that the fact that people are bothering to watch these movies is fuelling the incentive of the cash cow that is now marvel until truly exciting new production idea is made by marvel definitely will not be wasting my time again ', ' ve been big fan of the marvel films long before iron man but this is the worst movie marvel studios has put out besides being just plain out bland lay most blame on brie larson utter lack of personality at no point was remotely emotionally invested in her character she easily right up there with kristen stewart and hayden christiansen for utterly lacking in any ability to emote if this is the character they re going to base he mcu around going forward good luck to them ', ' would have loved to given this 10 it was fantastic show karens to whiny dragging friends into her drama getting them killed she uses her sweet cry baby sympathetic ways to manipulate men into getting what she wants was even more disgusted when she said she was from vermont she nothing like vermonter no accent like we have hoped shed get murdered for the murders she caused to happen every time saw here got nauseous electra was amazing in the moves she performed she really added to the show foggy was also with good humor felt badly at times for him he was treated with such disregard by matt an karen besides her loved dare devil recommend it ', ' this is one of the best shows ever all the actors and crew dedication and professionalism show in each episode it is visually powerful humanizing and entertaining the chemistry between nelson murdock and page is magical charlie cox and vincent onofrio were born for the roles of matt murdock and wilson fisk the characters are not perfect but they make you fall in love with them with all their flaws ', ' never expected marvel to do this bad this movie is totally unnecessary and have no link with other movies ', ' thought it is an origin story of natasha romanoff aka black window but am disappointed by the storyline didn expected this poor storyline ', ' black widow 2021 is one of the weaker entries in the marvel cinematic universe it actually rather forgettable to be honest set after the events of captain america civil war 2016 the film follows its eponymous hero as she teams up with her long lost sister to take down the people in charge of the red room the brain washing facility that natasha herself was forced into as child the picture starts out feeling quite different to the other entries in its franchise with somewhat dark tone and bourne esque vibe eventually though it deteriorates into the same formulaic sort of thing we ve seen countless times from marvel studios with big cgi set pieces and forced in humour the comedy often clashes with the flick tone and is frankly sometimes quite annoying whereas the action is far too infrequent and intangible to be fully satisfying ray winston villain is also the most bland and uninteresting of any baddie in the mcu and yes that even includes malekith the dark elf from thor the dark world 2011 the film isn bad don get me wrong there are few entertaining action scenes the performances are all on point and the story is generally engaging it just feels like pretty passive experience though it isn massively compelling and quite few of its plot points fall totally flat still it enjoyable enough to be worth watch once however can see myself revisiting it any time soon and because of where it falls in the mcu chronology don think really need to 6 10 ', ' finally watched this film after much anticipation and this movie is nothing but over hyped overpraised garbage imdb you should be shamed by letting all these obviously underaged virgins that wouldn know true filmmaking if it bitchslapped them in the face all you people are concerned with is special effects and unnecessary action if those two elements are in film for you the character development creative ideas acting script and cinematography doesn matter which is very sad and leads me to worry about the misleading rating system for the future of filmmaking this amateur film is currently rated 101 on imdb so you suggesting that this film is better than batman begins heat pans labyrinth blade runner rosemary baby the deer hunter jaws warrior let the right one in and the list goes on if you think that the avengers is better than the small list of films mentioned then feel sorry for you because you are mixed up in that group mentioned earlier all the other truly brilliant films that are being unappreciated you still have one true film aficionado that will always separate the great from the garbage ', ' yesterday completed the series loved all of it episodes after watching whole series can say relate to it moreover it the best marvel series and must watch totally recommend it ', ' wonder if this show is taking place in another parallel universe you know multiverse and all this show appropriates the indian culture and shows it all pakistani pakistanis in this show speak hindi not urdu there is indian classical music playing in bgm most of the time there is no burqa wearing women in sight in entire karachi there are ton of bollywood references this show seems an extension of real life pakistani opening indian restaurant in us which happens all the time anyway it would have been more authentic if they showed some pakistani culture for change am sure there will be at least few things good and worthy about pakistan the girl playing kamala is cute but overdoes her expressions which start irritating after some time ', ' this was absolutely the best interpretation of comic book character as of yet this had heart and violence all wrapped into one this is how the marvel shows should be done loved it it also brings up real world view of how our military is suffering from the affects of being overseas this should hit the heart of every american just can say enough of how good this show is can wait for season 2 ', ' worst part of the movie was the actress larson seem like she didn want to be there she didn get in the rolo and fail to convince me that she was captain marvel pretty much she just stood there and smirked and gave teenage like juvenile responses story was weak the conflict was well juviniel went with my two daughters and they both walked out saying it was boring and stupid honestly makes me not want to watch marvel movies anymore black panther was overrated but at least that was decent movie but this was just horrible ', ' my honest advice is to wait until it comes out on streaming video uninspiring that the best way to describe it plot script character interplay everything plodding and forced larson is stiff 1 dimensional and brings complete lack of warmth or humor to the character how much of her terrible lack of emotion is bad acting and how much is poor direction and writing is open to discussion suppose my niece marvel fan as well was unimpressed and noted several times that parts were simply stupid it sad fans have invested 12 years and many dollars in the story arc it would be shame to see disney marvel blow it on character nobody wanted or is likely to care about marvel says this is to be the new face of the mcu if that the case count me out trying to create strong female characters is laudable but this mary sue dumpster fire isn the way to do it take your cues from dc wonder woman that was just plain fantastic ', ' superhero movies have been ruling the box office especially in the last 3 years with both the avengers films and the recent spiderman film taking the theatres like storm the grand scale an ensemble cast coupled with mouth watering cgi and action sequences are they key ingredients of these multiple course michelin star cuisines but what makes marvel stand out from all the movies in the superhero genre are the complexity of the characters one such character introduced to us was the daredevil k matt murdock brilliantly portrayed by charlie cox in 2015 he wasn a part of the broader mcu of disney marvel studios yet spoiler alert until the latest spiderman flick ensured the fan favorite indeed enters into the mcu hadn watched daredevil until recently and boy was surprised it was superhero show unlike any other superhero show 9 year old matt murdock loses his eye sight in an accident and lives with his single father who fought underground boxing matched for living much of his time is spent in sewing up his injured father after brutal fight and to add to the character misery his father too is taken away soon after you might be thinking this provides sufficient material for plethora of self pity and self indulgence for lesser creators but the creators of daredevil used this anchor to define the character and he taken under the wings of another blind person who possessed exceptional fighting skills and that where matt learns to see the world through his blind eyes where the show stands out is at no point do you feel sorry for the kid his disability is shown in matter of fact way which is too endearing to see matt and his best friend foggie nelson graduate from columbia law school with summa cum laude and come back to hell kitchen an unforgiving part of new york and decide to make the city better place with their legal skills this is where the show shines in showing the fight for good versus evil and what does it take to defeat evil is there line one should draw at fighting evil or it an all hands on deck approach that is needed to bring evil to an end charlie cox matt begins his fight by hitting out smalltime thugs in the dark alleys of new york which are some of the finest action sequences with the camera that moves forward down the alley as the fight progresses and gradually climbs up the value chain of crime to see who is actually pulling the strings enter wilson fisk k the kingpin who is played by vincent onofrio in his career defining role have watched ton of superhero movies and have gone to rabbit holes of reddit pages to read about super villians like thanos and ultron but none of them actually scared me as much as vincent wilson fisk did he was human just like matt murdock but here was one giant literally of man who has no qualms about using violence to meet his goals his only weakness his affection for art aficionado vanessa marianna played by the gorgeous ayelet zurer with fisk at the helm of the metaphorical tower of darkness it poses some serious questions to catholic matt murdock who must find way to stop his biggest nemesis daredevil is very personal story of matt and wilson two people with troubled childhoods both introduced to violence at an early age but both take different lessons from their experiences wislon fisk dialogues gets under your skin and matt skin as well and this creates mouth watering set pieces which will be loved by any performing arts enthusiast let alone superhero comic book fan the darkness in matt life literally and metaphorically clouds his choices right upto season 3 and he is almost convinced by the means of wilson fisk but does he do it take another life d want you to explore this answer through 3 seasons of this masterpiece you ll binge watch this one so grab your popcorn and soda and be prepared for roller coaster ride of emotions humor drama action and lot of introspection for the choices matt face are representation of the choices we too face each day and what we make of those choices you will fall in love with each of these magnificently crafted characters good or bad and cherish the journey matt makes from law graduate into the daredevil ', ' nia dacosta the marvels blasts onto the screen with the exhilarating promise of an intergalactic adventure propelled by stunning visuals and pulse pounding action yet like kree starship navigating chaotic asteroid field it encounters narrative turbulence that threatens to derail its trajectory the film unquestionably soars on its technical merits dacosta visual direction paints the cosmos in dazzling hues from the shimmering neon of hyperspace tunnels to the crumbling majesty of kree architecture action sequences crackle with kinetic energy particularly as captain marvel unleashes her cosmic power in finale that pure popcorn munching delight iman vellani shines as kamala khan injecting the film with the infectious enthusiasm of wide eyed fan girl thrust into cosmic odyssey her ms marvel is the heart and soul of the film reminding us of the sheer joy of discovering superhero greatness within oneself however the narrative struggles to maintain its stratospheric flight the plot careens through timelines and planets leaving viewers disoriented and grappling with shifting motivations character arcs particularly captain marvel journey from cosmic protector to reluctant guide feel undercooked and their emotional payoffs unsatisfying teyonah parris is captivating as monica rambeau but her role feels frustratingly underdeveloped the film hints at her powerful connection to both danvers and khan only to leave it unexplored tantalizing possibility lost in the narrative nebula ultimately the marvels is cinematic enigma it a visually stunning spectacle with thrilling action and charming leads but its narrative flaws prevent it from achieving true greatness for mcu fans seeking dazzling space romp it a diverting journey but those hoping for deeply satisfying superhero tale might find themselves navigating celestial plot black hole ', ' this is the best thing marvel have done in while and the first thing they ve done in ages that had heart and soul parts of this didn even feel like superhero tv show because it had strong lead with personality and life and friends and family kamala was so likable because she so relatable and feels like real person which is also testament to iman acting the storyline was interesting and even when it moved slower was still interested because was so invested in the characters as people the diversity was amazing and centering asian muslim women was beautiful and needs to be done more when heard marvel are unsure if to renew this show was heartbroken horrified but not surprised considering how little time stories like this are given however nobody can say this is bad tv show and so if this does get season 2 everyone on this show can rest knowing they created an amazing tv show dare say the best tv show marvel has ever made ', ' show made for teenage girls gossip girl is better even the new one after infinity and emdgame feel that tje mcu is on the downhill hope not for long ', ' fantastic for preteen and teenage girls if you aren in that demographic then this show isn for you the protagonist and rest of the supporting cast aren likeable in the slightest and the story is just boring there nobody to cheer for and it hard to find anyone relatable not to mention ms marvels powers are highly ambiguous it not clear what her powers actually are because it never fully explained the lead actress is good actress and it clear she trying her best but good acting cannot save the poor script poor characters and poor pacing of the show 1 10 unless you re big marvel fan skip this one ', ' first of all big fan of marvel comics and shows daredevil in my opinion has one of the best story lines was very scared to see it brought back to life after the big failure of 2002 movie and yes also the fact that netflix took the initiative and now can say m extremely thankful they did the first teaser already gave me major hopes for the show and they certainly paid off to not spoil the main actions of the series was positively astonished that there was no character shipping and the main focus was on the character essence the actors the screenplay the music and most importantly the action scenes all made this show so likable must watch they better make season 2 or else ', ' found ms marvel to be lacking in all areas story writing epically all bad ve been marvel fan since was little kid don want to see this ms marvel want to see other marvel heroes male or female with better story lines not trying to please 1 crowd or group of people ridiculous how marvel or disney is only trying to please small part of their fan base and not putting out better mini series than this subpar show please go back to entertainment no this garbage ', ' this movie should be in begining if all avengers movies like thor or iron man not after the avengers movie that to bad ', ' if were 12 year old girl m sure would love this but m not and don very much aimed at younger audience too cheesy too woke the only thing missing is canned laughter soundtrack ', ' its not best its not top but still its watchable this movies was required for upcoming marvel projects but most of all its clears why monica hates captain marvel and wjy cap marvel was not there to help or care maria when she needed her most except from these this movie also explore the story of kamala khan aka ms marvel she also took the main highlight of the movie carol shows her best and she was looking good and doing good from her last marvel movie maria aka photon actress has lot to do and she was not so much connected with this entanglement like other two cap marvel and ms marvel ms marvel actress shows us that she could be the heart of upcoming marvel shows ', ' we respect every single religion but its too much in just 2 episode video transaction is too heavy video editing is poor story is ok but its just seems regular teen age drama ', ' not sure how to write reviews really m real fan of the choreographing in this film from my eye it looked as like if the actors remained stationary they would have been hit g nat 1st fight scene lifting leg knee to avoid fatal strikes feels more believable definitely think this compares well with winter soldier ', ' clich storyline tokyo underworld being wrecked by monkey and ghost kids would love it could nt bear past the first episode wonder how shows like this get almost an eight point rating it getting unreliable this app progressively ', ' while the best part of the movie is its shortened length the movie itself suffers from lack of attention to detail it feels as if the director had no clue how to make believable sci fi fantasy movie battle scenes lack continuity while one persons attack can render total destruction while the same attack barely knocks someone off their feet the ladies never really hit each other and their hair is always perfect after scramble and not one scratch on their pretty faces the relationship aspects of the film felt disingenuous and forced there is just too many instances of the movie that leave you scratching your head and asking yourself why did they put that in the movie with that said it wasn as horrible as expected it was just poorly directed which resulted in subpar acting performances ', ' unfortunately after the first episode have to say that it doesn feel like marvel it kind of feels like m watching over enthusiastic disney show have already speculated on how the series is going to end up and would love to see if it happens theory ms marvel is going to have big fight where she is going to the loose the bracelet destroyed she will then go one to sulk for bit get pep talk from her mother realize that the power has been inside her all along and end up saving the day and going to prom or something this could be hard copy and paste from captain marvel where she realized she had the power all along ', ' honestly it boring poor script 3 10 making 4 10 entertainment 2 10 too much useless stuff think it was for some selected people not for everyone ', ' ve grown up on marvel comics ve been to just about every marvel movie on the big screen the marvels does not do it this feels like hashed production for netflix the plot is all over the place the script is atrocious and nobody in the theater laughed or even moved except to use the restrooms where have the excellent writers gone the imagination the ideas the main villain is weak the heroes are weak and this all looks like something we ve seen before albeit less exiting hands down the most forgettable marvel film ever produced wait for it to pop up on disney in couple weeks hope that someone can save marvel some of the happiest moments of my life were watching the multiverse of characters but this one falls flat in every regard ', ' the movie has lot of action scenes but it lacks cohesive story perhaps those viewers who are dc multi verse fans can make more sense of it the entire context of the primary character does not even start to come together until the end of the movie then the movie ends leaving the viewer begging for the rest of the story ', ' all all need to calm down this is an origin story compared to the origin movie of captain america or hulk even thor black widow is above par the first movie is always little bumpy but thoroughly enjoyable plus they dared to touch on some deeper over arching themes of child exploitation and family dynamics all m hearing is we wanted the exact comics puhlease grow up ', ' slow dumb not entertaining made me think of how great the first iron man was and how this movie never captured my attention like it did ', ' what epic waste of my time never again oh please never agein ', ' the avengers is an okay superhero movie that it great deal of the problem is that there are too many characters at once the viewer doesn get any time to understand most of the characters backstories or motivations they are suddenly called up for duty to defend the earth against the scrawny and mysterious alien supervillain based off of norse god most of the superheroes were not interesting as their personalities were not that well developed the exception to this is iron man who is wonderfully played by robert downey jr iron man is depicted as wealthy sarcastic playboy who isn necessarily hero for altruistic reasons the smarminess and smugness of iron man character may turn lot of people off but hey at least it a character there are few scenes where the hulk is really funny but that is only as the hulk persona rather than as bruce banner the rest of the superheroes are bland and undeveloped as characters the film is also confused as to its tone it tries to take its superhero world seriously like the tim burton batman but also adds in tongue in cheek humor and makes attempts to be self referential and campy like the joel schumaker batmans the balance is uneven at best the film characters with the exception of the incredible hulk do not have enough fame or notoriety like that of superman batman or spiderman to be familiar to general audience this film is catered to an audience intimately familiar with the marvel comics universe and all of its characters which will leave an uninitiated viewer utterly clueless about who who who the heck is black widow nick fury why do thor and loki speak in bizarre overly proper form of english is it because they re aliens why should we care it is merely personal matter of taste but cgi has not evolved to the point where the special effects look entirely real the closest computer animation has gotten to being realistic is james cameron avatar where the aliens have genuinely human expressions and movements the cgi in the avengers is ugly to look at particularly the ship the avengers use as home base as well as the alien invaders towards the end it is not worth it to pay extra for 3 glasses to watch grey ugly aliens riding grey ugly spiny snakes while emerging from grey ugly bland modernistic monstrosities that pass for alien spaceships the ultimate irony is the cheap gorilla and diving suit from robot monster haven seen the movies just stills looks more creative and inspired than the effects in this movie the point is that there is little color and beauty in the cgi and it always looks more fake and lifeless than rubber puppets or furry ewok costumes ever could would go so far to say that the greyness and blandness of the alien and avengers flying fortress design totally detracted from the power of the action sequences notwithstanding the distracting cgi the action scenes as stand alone pieces are engaging and entertaining to watch in short the avengers lacks interesting characters and while not entirely the fault of the filmmakers technology still has long way to go in 2012 before anything approaching realism can be fully realized so my criticism in unfair in that respect the cgi wasn pleasant to look at watch the avengers for the action scenes and for hulk and iron man who are funny and interesting it a fair effort but nothing that approaches timeless action classic at least the christopher reeve superman movies were infused with tongue in cheek humor and had an undeniable camp value the avengers takes itself too seriously to become nostalgic classic like superman ', ' m quite disappointed in this movie first of all because she my favorite character and second because for the mcu it leaves lot to be desired think the movie should have addressed lot of issues not only in the beginning but throughout the film black widow is character who was always very mysterious and reserved so this movie should have surprised us more and put the protagonist in her corresponding place far above what was put in this film ', ' ms marvel title is big responsibility and am not trying to bias as pakistani to support this show this is amazing and you will learn something new as marvel in films always do culture tradition and live style of the asians iman has that different and lively personality and she is earning by her efforts am super happy for her and the team beautiful background music go kamala go ', ' recommended to watch human love the scene such poser ', ' black widow is terribly made utterly ridiculous pointless cgi fest with occasionally some good moments in it the film has promising and tense opening finally giving us an insight into natasha past and her background and then it opens again with some credits and music and takes another 10 15 minutes to actually kickstart it story and plot the screenwriters never really settle on particular thread and keep juggling different ideas and story beats resulting in mess of film the action is cartoonish and quite pathetic natasha spy normal human falls off three storey bulding and hits her head twice on some pipes and gets back up immediately without scratch the actors do their part but the script is haywire and there seems to be lack of creativity from the people who helmed it everything just comes across as mundane and flat the villain well taskmaster shows up occasionally the film tries to tie natasha and the villain stories together but it is done in such an odd haphazard way that ultimately it leaves you feeling frustrated instead of emotionally capturing you the movie is genuinely uninteresting and is an abysmal send off for one of the most beloved mcu characters and actors the editing is fine the cinematography is bland the music is forgettable david harbour and florence pugh may be the only positives in this film along with scarlett presence all three of them have genuinely good chemistry which does bring few laughs and emotions from our side the film has weird and twisted morality and clear and obvious undertone which it didn need and quite frankly leaves sick taste in your mouth don waste your time with this go watch winter soldier instead ', ' didn sleep the day before went to see avengers was so excited before it started said to myself it better be worth it and it was more the avengers is not justa perfect movie its masterpiece can believe action movie can be so funny throughout the movie there was smile on my face brilliant characterization screenplay acting and action this is revolutionary movie as it has raised the bar for upcoming action flicks take out all the action and its still worth watching can guarantee one thing that this movie will expand the fan base of hulk he is much more believable than the previous ones and no character is prefect the one amusing thought for me was that how can petty humans like hawk eye and black widow can contribute in the arsenal of superheroes buy was wrong this is must see movie for all ages go see out tonight ', ' introducing the family of incredibles brilliant marvel of movie signifying the freedom of self ', ' expectations were sky high because of the excellent reviews for avengers flooding the internet during last week it forced me to watch the first show and it was worth the price of the ticket truly amazing thats what you can call this film in terms of entertainment film doesn fall short of entertainment and actors this is genuine multistarrer and the fans of superhero movies cant afford to miss this one there is no point in going into the story of the movie its just regular stuff villain trying to take over the world and superhero fighting him and saving the world but in this movie there is not one but 5 6 of them trying to save the world including black widow and hawkeye the film begins with attack from loki the villain on lab and stealing the power source loki also takes control of the doctor and hawk eye nick fury goes to assemble the superheroes ironman black widow captain america hulk and together they fight loki to stop his plan of raking over the world though there is an unexpected visit from thor during the first hour the rest of the movie is full of guns shootouts missiles and breathtaking action scenes which will hold your attention the last 40 50 min is full of action and entertainment the film also leaves chance for sequel the first hour is somewhat slow in the middle many dialogues were not much audible but the movie later picks up the introduction of characters took long time indeed there are many to introduce still that hampers the pace of the movie the dialogues of iron man to captain america was great there are comic scenes here and there the 2nd hour is the unlimited action full of thrills and fights the special effects are awesome 3d was really effective found myself blinking on approaching missiles ironman and all that is something really miss nowadays in 3d films 3d was worth after all in pathetic theater on going to the performances everyone did their part perfectly but the show stealer was mark ruffalo as hulk his intro was welcomed with tremendous applause he rocked in the 2nd hour and his confrontation with loki was hilarious and one of the best scenes of the movie didn like the incredible hulk but in this one hulk was excellent after hulk credit goes to none other than one of my favourite actors robert downey jr his dialogues were cool and his performance was super cool as always my pick is his scene with loki am not adding spoilers but just watch out for that scene when loki tries to take control of him and next one that was the best scene in the movie chris hemsworth as thor did his part well his intro was good than the others and also fight scenes chris evans as captain america was ok nothing much to perform though samuel jackson as nick fury was good scarlett johnson as black widow looked great and performed well tom hiddleston as loki was convincing as the routine villain and jereme renner as hawkeye was ok direction was slow in the middle but later picked up and the 2nd hour was entertaining with comic and action scenes dialogues were good and funny fight scenes are well shot and blended in the movie and even though 2nd half is full of fights its does not become tiresome and boring special applause for that all together avengers is spectacular superhero showdown that should not be missed for fans of superhero movies and also for regular audience in the box office this one is sure to break collection records as said sequel can be expected as the film gives hints about it in the end credits go with 4 5 for avengers and it really is worth the price of the ticket rating 4 5 entertainer ', ' agh really wanted to love this movie m huge fan of the first one and the phases before this one but it another marvel movie that leaves me feeling disappointed yes there were some funny bits some good fx but ultimately poorly written and directed ms marvel was great and carried it for me she was interesting and actually displayed range of emotons which was refreshing in this movie for me the main villan was the worst part one dimensional and wooden there was no back story or depth she was just pointless villain for the sake of having villain but still love samuel who never disappoints and am intrigued by the post credit scene fingers crossed that the next marvel outing after this has better writers who have read the comics ', ' when watched the first episode of ms marvel was struck by two impressions the first was wow what creative new take on the marvel hero ms marvel takes up on late stan lee project before his passing that focused on everyday superheroes the creator himself saw the legacy of superheroes as inclusive empowerment ms marvel is at least in the first episode an endearing and engaging story of an everyday teen superhero coming to terms with both new found superpowers and the real american experience of first generation immigrant family can relate to that my second impression was to wonder how the story of non white muslim family and non superhero superhero would fare with american audiences after all she not from krypton or the object of scientific experiment gone wrong or even the product of an alien abduction nope she just found magic bangle worse she an immigrant kudos to disney and marvel as lifelong sci fi and marvel fan was not that excited by what though would be kid superhero series stand corrected and educated was truly carried away beyond my preconceptions this is creative young adult show with message for everyone ', ' series with many script flaws the damage control agents and villains completely ignoring the heroine in many scenes do the villains open the portal and in the end just give up totally meaningless ', ' first of all the movie is pretty good and definitely worth watching it is keeping up with the spirit of marvel cinematic universe it is nice movie and im damn sure r gonna love it screw the haters and one last thing it is not at all like any superman movie from which it was being compared by its haters ', ' quick review of captain marvel it way way better then wonder woman sorry though wonder woman sucked and really can understand why feminists went mad over it an ex model who can act to save her life in film where she needs group of men to help her and man ultimately saves the day yes real women power movie ffs anyway captain marvel isn this at all it a fun entertaining action film in the 90 style it not non stop modern action which gets bit tedious is it the best marvel film nope is it the worst not by long way don understand the bad reviews or the criticism of brie larson it funny ok younger viewers are not going to get quite few of the jokes as its 90 based the special effects are top notch the story is ok the acting is top notch as you expect it funny has the twists we ve all come to expect and cat steals the show what more do you want ', ' ms marvel is amazing show like the design the cgi effects everything is excellent m waiting for the newest episode and please renew for second season ', ' so for our first trip to the cinema in over year and half my son and were looking forward to seeing the mcu back on the big screen and seeing black widow sadly never thought would say this as massive die hard marvel fan but this was the most boring and pointless mcu film to date the first hour was extremely boring and this film added nothing new to the mcu having established its time frame we knew the ending before it even got going and that added to it being even more boring and predictable evan the action scenes were boring and predictable and nothing new to add to the experience on the plus was nice seeing william hurt again and made us really want him back chasing the hulk this may have been better coming out few years ago say maybe before infinity war but not now sorry marvel but this film is the weakest of the mcu and maybe few years to late to arrive ', ' really enjoy this show the characters the twists and female leads ve watched since season one great show and ritter is great ', ' it started good in the beginning and started to excite that it gonna be bang but that last one hour is so boring that felt to stop watching action in good in the beginning but climax action is like junk video clips added together ', ' hate this show expected daredevil to be badass and everyone cheering him on and him being badass to everyone and stuff but no he doesn even do the dd symbol on fire in the ground thing he doesn even wear his suit till the end he not even badass nobody even knows who he is they hate him know you re trying to be realistic or dark but just stop you might as well just call it boring crime show if maybe the creators just made the show less boring more fighting more of daredevil in his suit being hero and everyone cheering him on you know respect you guys for trying but cmon this is just boring screw you netflix ', ' no story as other marvel movies only action scenes can be appreciated this movie made to introduce new characters that it ', ' yeah folks this is boring movie there was absolutely no reason to make that film once you see it you will know maybe the agents of scarjo convinced marvel that she has big following and they said ok lets do this movie or they put the stats down and said that there is lot of momentum with female heroins now and that will defo make extra to poor marvel studios so who cares about quality anymore right they ve done that part already quality been there done that lets get some more cash think that the writers went for real cash grab here and marvel and everyone else around this film ', ' the story is mind numbingly unoriginal the movie was boring and tideus to get through almost dozed off in the cinema which is surprising since the last time that happened was when was 5 years old don know what expected and deeply regret paying money to go see this don know what it is with marvel they just write the same story over and over this is the last marvel movie ever watched on cinema by the way who made the special fx its literal garbage that being said the actors did great job portraying their characters and should not be held accountable for this trainwreck of movie ', ' what can say the headline says it all how this script ever made it to the screen is piece of wizardry that dr strange would be proud of and would make gandalfs head spin m actually embarrassed for the actors in this film and for the execs at marvel because this dross will certainly have damaged their reputation and shows the end maybe in sight for the mcu sad to see it sink this low believe there is plot in there somewhere but it pretty ridiculous even for marvel suspect the target audience is the under 7 and some of them would probably turn this off many reviews describe this as messy think that a massive understatement ', ' muslim superhero really with the way their religion treats women children and dogs have witnessed that treatment firsthand in iraq and afghanistan nobody asked for this pathetic character except for bunch of way to skinny white guilt ridden liberals refuse to pander to them and so this is the first marvel feature will be completely skipping ', ' m huge fan of the marvel universe but was so disappointed in this movie it seems like marvel is over doing it with too many shows and movies coming out all the time basic storytelling is being lost for this movie it felt like everything about it was rushed and not thought out well enough lazy script writing and no emotion kept looking at my watch in the theater waiting for it to end some of the situations wrapped up too neatly with no real context on how that happened hard to explain without spoilers but rolled my eyes several times and ve never done that in movie theater if you want to see it wait for it to come on streaming paying all that money to see it in the theater was such waste the only good thing about it was the end credit scene ', ' ill start by saying that the music and animations were the only things that we enjoyed pressing play started off strong with the opening song but quickly turned full 180 was constantly checking if was watching marvel series thought it was going to be interesting with me having no idea what the series was about no trailers no reading no anything but nooo this left scar it my first time to write my opinion on imdb and m sad that it had to be this ', ' at first thought the show was mediocre the first 2 episodes are really annoying the way it set up makes it seem like one of the kiddie nickelodeon shows like henry danger not fan of how they had things pop up on screen but m episode 3 they really start developing the story and it actually ends up being good if only the first 2 episodes had the story telling the last episodes had this rating would be higher ', ' used to be huge marvel fan but the last few have been huge disappointments found the movie to be quite boring characters were nothing exciting the only saving grace was some pretty good action scenes but beyond that rough hour and half thought they brought some absurdity without the comedy toward the end which made me keep looking at my watch just waiting for the movie to end thank goodness its not long movie it would have been even more painful than thought was on the verge of leaving the movie theater and going home early can recall the last time movie this was on consideration ', ' it kinda interesting when the story come to pakistan zone many of history and traditional got the spot light kamala family just basiclly so good and that make me feel comfortable with how ever it doesn seem to be poor superpower movie so think may go poplar in kid ', ' by far this is the worst show coming out of marvel tv shows am not getting what exactly they trying to show everything is so artificial in the show somehow survived episode 3 but 4 can rated as one of the worst episode in tv ', ' had good time with this movie was invested throughout love the characters especially the new additions of yelena and alexei the characters have great chemistry and laughed lot florence pugh and david harbour rock in this movie florence pugh continues to impress me her acting skills are top notch see midsommar and already knew she could kick butt see fighting with my family there are couple of acting moments she has where was like damn one literally brought me to tears and felt exactly what the character felt and david harbour plays his role amazingly so funny likeable in an unlikeable way if that makes sense there are two things this movie almost does that could have made it amazing one is to go for darker tone and don mean like the ominous feeling of infinity war but genuinely dark tone that would work perfectly with the dark thematic background of the main character and the start of the movie made me think they were going that route it was pretty messed up but the rest of the movie felt exactly like the template mcu movie love that template but it would have been cool to see something different here the second thing that could have made it stand out is the musical score ve complained so many times that the weakest part of the mcu is the music there are few scores like but most are unimpactful the new mcu shows have stepped it up wandavision falcon winty and especially loki when black widow started loved the musical score it was immediately impactful and elevated the prologue it gave the movie character and then the credits show that it composed by lorne balfe who has become one of my favorite composers but as usual in the mcu the music is kept mostly in the background and has very little impact on the scenes think of the music played during the final fight in civil war or during the funeral scene in thor 2 the music owns me and it could have in black widow but barely noticed it for the rest of the movie the action is pretty awesome couple of moments in the fight scenes were unclear but it was mostly well done overall had great time with this movie and liked it even more the second time 3 viewings opening thursday imax 7 8 2021 12 1 2021 4 28 2023 ', ' too childish absolutely not for my taste hard pass mon marvel you seem like you lost the magic since endgame movie eternal is suck moonknight m not sure how you will integrate it with the whole marvel universe picture and now this ', ' by his series marvel disappointed the fans boring and worst series have ever watched don know why marvel given the reference of pakistan shame on marvel ', ' its just awesome not matter how many times you have already seen it it will still give you chills when the heroes first appear when they fight together and between themselves when the final battle happends etc it manages to mix all the heroes perfectly giving all of them important things to do and keeping their personalities from their solo films despite the years its still super fresh and will probably never get old ', ' have enjoyed watching this show and love charlie cox as daredevil and vince onofrio as wilson fisk all the episodes are great and the action and courtroom scenes are all terrific just wish it had lasted more than 3 seasons out of ', ' we loved the show loved the family dynamic and that they explored her cultural background and historical events that was woefully ignorant of going in the cast was lot of fun and really can wait to see ms marvel and captain marvel team up not what some folks may have expected from an mcu series but rigid expectations are the enemy of enjoyment ', ' did you do your homework no seriously hundreds of hours of mcu viewing are required before starting this movie the very best thing could say about the marvels was didn hate carol danvers this go around in fact she was probably my favorite character of the movie and that saying lot as she was absolutely insufferable in her debut movie so much so captain marvel remains as my least favorite mcu movie of the 33 made so far can say much more positive about this mess it wasn the worst okay there a backhanded compliment but ton of this was just dumb it felt like an entire season of some obscure mcu show on disney that virtually no one would watch all packed into 105 minutes oh that another actual compliment it was mercifully under 2 hours the marvels does an incredibly lousy job of introducing reintroducing audiences to the world of captain marvel and her two sidekicks the synopsis is all over the place but suffice to say one lame villain is seeking revenge and trying to wreak havoc on the universe and only these three heroes can stop her never mind we live in universe of countless avengers but digress sorry refuse to do research homework before watching movie if the writers can explain plots subplots to potentially new audience then it is poorly written virtually nothing is explained here and unless you ve watched multiples of hours of backstories you ll just have to accept these people over here are the innocents these are the heroes these are the villains etc no attachments needed just accept what you re shown lot of people praised the ms marvel character and she was fine she was literally female peter parker but didn mind her boring but also fine was the character of monica rambeu nick fury fizzled out and literally no other character was worthy of mentioning commented that lot of this was dumb and one of those ideas was singing race of people wow that was rough scene also dumb false threats like having to evacuate ship for reasons captain marvel being superman 11 in her first movie being reduced to barely superhero this time around until the story needed her to be superman 11 again and while it not the story the editing was dumb and made the movie even more confusing again absolutely hated 2019 captain marvel but honestly might rewatch that one over ever seeing this chaos again at least there was straightforward storyline that was more interesting familiar and contained far more compelling nick fury for all the times the dceu was trying to catchup mimic the mcu at least dc is doing the right thing with rebooting after string of failures truly wish the mcu would take 5 years off and come back with something new ever since endgame there been 11 mcu movies while some were okay most have been awful only spider man no way home and black panther wakanda forever have been great this is truly skip you re missing absolutely nothing by leapfrogging this one and heading right into deadpool 3 final thoughts that all said originally vowed to never see this after hating the first captain marvel movie so much but m not 100 upset that did finally see it as previously revealed actually didn hate her character this time she wasn the completely unlikable or unapproachable arrogant she was in the original this time around she was in fact the complete opposite ', ' marvel fan 10 10 for the normal people 9 5 10 best movie right now to waste your time and enjoy it ', ' thought it was great first episode breath of fresh air to the mcu and thought it was good to see the mcu from normal persons view in universe looking forward to seeing what the show has in store for the rest of the season ', ' well the finale was tonight and just got to say watch the show the whole way through it a wild ride and one of my favorite shows ever bitter sweet ending but the show ended on high note ', ' black widow 2021 for much of its 113 minute running time feels like what one might expect from lifetime direct to video movie dysfunctional family struggling to overcome personal and interpersonal issues to embrace traditional middle class family values movie goers who have eagerly awaited star wars prequel featuring ma and pa vader and baby darth will probably enjoy black widow while fans of the franchise will likely be disappointed the characters talk about the avengers tony stark and captain america but not even brief cameo or an avengers logo is shown with many in hollywood apparently still clinging to discredited allegations of russian collusion the villains are russians more or less the main russians are played by british performers ray winstone rachel weisz and florence pugh and americans david harbour and scarlett johansson to avoid any allegations of cultural appropriation none of the performers with the notable exception of harbor seems to act very russian even while drinking vodka and speaking russian part of the reason the actors don seem authentically russian may be attributed to the self conscious diversity among the throngs of evil minions russia is generally considered somewhat less racially tolerant and inclusive than the antebellum south but the throngs of elite female assassins in their leather bondage outfits are ethnically diverse as they prepare to turn tables on men who treat women as subservient unlike most movies they wear no hoods or masks to fully display that they are female and diverse but the notion of russians tolerating racial diversity among an elite corps of commando assassins seems improbable leaving the impression of pandering to progressives which also seems incongruous in film featuring extrajudicial executions assassinations unauthorized wiretaps enhanced interrogations et cetera the movie seems to be about 40 family drama 30 feminist female empowerment 20 action and 10 gratuitous cgi effects with generous measure of misandry throughout the plot is an absurd contrivance based on radical feminist talking points exaggerated to comic proportions the villain actions make little sense unless one ignores logic and assumes he is an insane misogynistic megalomaniac it also makes little dramatic sense as the action is reduced to manipulating images on huge computer display in fashion worthy of dr evil the villain made sure his years of preparation could be undone with few keystrokes and built his secret fortress so the slightest damage would trigger sequence of cataclysmic explosions as is common among many recent hollywood productions there is no typical story romance offering instead tale of sisterly love between two girls who aren really sisters and aren particularly lovable there are several well choreographed action scenes including several fights among female martial artists harbour performance is noteworthy until he is sucked into the maudlin family drama the movie is disappointment on several levels the family drama is so bogged down in the mundane that the fantastic aspects of the superhero story seem less credible particularly due to numerous gaps in the plot beyond that the film seems harbinger of future disappointing efforts by film industry that increasingly seems more concerned with virtue signaling posturing and proselytizing about political correctitude than entertaining audiences ', ' if you like spiderman multiverse then you ll like this too the animation graphics with real action are awesome the story is truly coming of age and does an excellent job of introducing us to different culture and religion unfortunately some people are given it 1 star as they don like muslim super hero well why not representation matters and believes it important it well written it well researched and the cinematography is blast to watch watch it for yourself ', ' well think it lived up to its hype and finally black widow got satisfactory movie and kind of back story in an all family way the story is about how natasha running from the h e d after the sokovian accords deal the fun fact is most of the movie takes place between the airport fight and escaping the raft scene in the civil war the movie doesn linearly focus solely on the character black widow but also on the introduction of several characters and how it lays the foundation for the next phase the family saga was very good at the beginning and they all had very good chemistry and the comedic relief was brilliant the antagonist was like always the cliche mcu one where he has the picture of destroying the whole world and pocket it the problem was the power of the antagonist was let down in weird way had an okayish ending and satisfactory post credit scene was really impressed with the directing the acting was just superb special mention to pugh and harbour the comedy was spot on and really great opening credits the storyline was kinda flat and predictable but loved all the easter eggs and good movie for all mcu fans ', ' this is drama show by episode 6 was ready to stop it not enough action predictable boring plot with no twists and no suspense too much talking and everybody feeling sorry for themselves nobody should have to wait to the end of the season for things to pick up dont watch this season for action ', ' the movie is just spectacular from the beginning to the end you will enjoy every piece of it every character played its real role showing everybody special powers without overdosing the expectators the staff is outstanding watching samuel jackson robert downey jr chris evans scarlett johansson mark ruffalo chris hemsworth and tom hiddleston performing together was just amazing the story the special effects the sound the role of each character were just fabulous and would dare to say that is the best superhero movie ve ever seen in my whole life better than each individual movie of iron man hulk captain america thor and other famous superheroes it worth spend the time to go to the movie theater and watch this masterpiece enjoy ', ' ms marvel is show about young pakistani american girl who discovers she has obtained superpowers the show is cute but very bland and both the plot and the action are not very exciting especially when comparing to the brilliant writing some other mcu series have demonstrated additionally it seems the show is more concerned in shoving liberal progressive indoctrination down the throats of viewers rather then entertaining them the result is both in alienating and counter productive to the immersiveness of the show as was more annoyed with the backdoor attempt to educate or brainwash me as the viewer then what actually happens in the show disappointing and at times infuriating ', ' it was so refreshing to see this movie it fresh not preachy and the story is solid and logical all the way through besides being played by very well chosen actor captain marvel is the first woman main character in movie without any romantic involvement presented she is only focused on saving the world no cheesy romance to motivate her and no preachy or sentimental self realisation through emotional blah they stripped away all the usual gratuitous and boring tear jerkers and only left the essence of what superhero movie should be loved the story behind fury missing eye gave it 9 stars because there could have been more fight scenes ', ' black widow does not disappoint at all it was worthwhile wait do not understand why so much hate about it from the beginning of the movie personally got directly hooked the plot began to unfold in such an elegantly clear way and it always returned the emotion of tension joy fun or even drama the action sequences are spectacular the melee fights were very cool and in general the action of the movie is maintained from the beginning to the end the best thing in the whole movie was to see scarlet johansson in all her splendor in her character as always making it wonderful but florence pugh also complements this sister sister chemistry in such beautiful way and manages to make this adventure entertaining to the end also david harbor and rachel weisz make good roles as interesting funny and serious secondary characters but without much relevance in certain parts of the plot the script is not the best or original that marvel has presented but it is still good for movie with female protagonist even though have already known this character long before the villains are also not perfect and have previously seen objectives but therefore they did not make me the worst villains in the marvel universe as for the production the film is very well done some special effects have heard that do not look completely perfect compared to other films but it did not make me ugly in itself in conclusion black widow fulfilled my expectations of what expected in solo movie of this wonderful character of the wonderful scarlett johansson and although it is not perfect it does not make me the best marvel studios movie the film managed to awaken my emotion towards what comes from these superhero movies in the future and leaves me with good feeling of happiness for future sequel to this film and wanting to see it again ', ' the avengers is 2012 american superhero film based on the marvel comics superhero team of the same name produced by marvel studios and distributed by walt disney studios motion pictures now want to review the avanger movie for the action and the visual effect are good the emotional of the storyline think it is good enough but at the beginning the story is too fast and the ending is unclear but this movie is very amazing and didnt make me feel disappointed ', ' this version of kamala story is so wrong how she get the powers at the avenger comic con they should have kept fidelity to the original story or at least the video game story sorry disney marvel but this time after so many years you have managed to made it wrong ', ' the first season of this show is on par with some of the greatest shows of all time it was so unique and completely unapologetically brash season 2 started out promising but sort of lost it charm as it progressed and season 3 inexplicably went in completely different direction and left me wishing they hadn made it it gets 7 stars because of how good the 1st season was but it does peak there ', ' this series is lot of fun iman vallani is charming as the teenage superhero there is great supporting cast the story arc is true to course and the threat is convincing the writers also spent considerable effort to capture the culture and history of kamala khan community which found fascinating found this an all round entertaining project which should appeal to wide range of ages but especially younger audiences give this series 7 good out of 10 superhero adventure ', ' this show is just poorly written boring mainly for kids and teens possible that even they also hate this show disney plus mcu tv series have been amazing so far but this one is surely their worst series as an actor iman did very good job she is cute and funny but everything else about this series specially the storyline is soo bad boring pathetic that it becomes unbearable to watch hope this series either don come back ever as season 2 or they actually put some interesting thrilling story to watch ms marvel is disaster for mcu ', ' it geared towards kids shows more about cultural aspects than superhero aspects which is what we are watching for the children thing understand is there to rope in younger viewers but not when the characters are going to be in movies adults want to watch now we are forced to watch this garbage to know what going on when we watch movies with these kids in it it just poor concept ', ' don know remember ss1 to be really good then ss2 kinda lost it for me but ss3 really got me mean there so many cool scenes and lines so cool that sometimes just got to replay it just to appreciate it fully sorry watched ss3 few weeks ago couldn remember how felt all could remember now is some really cool scenes remember me screaming so cool to the screen oh and sorry but couldn help it to think that if dexter were there things would be so much simpler or like dexter would just kill him already duhhhh that remind me got to do the world favor and go comment on dexter warning pp to stay away from dexter final ss sr bit off topic daredevil great should watch love it ookay ', ' actually walked in kinda skeptical but it really got started well so then after its foundation was laid was rather impressed by its progress and the fact that it sustained its premise it takes some time to let its meat marinade but it gels and is worth really fun ride stay for the after credit scenes enjoy ', ' pointless filler wasted 20 on this and spent most of the movie waiting for the end credits in the hope that something interesting would happen explosions and dated action punctuated log drawn out conversations that added nothing to the movie filled with boring dialogue there about enough plot here for 20 minute cartoon and the rest is mediocre padding if this wasn a marvel movie most people would have switched it off halfway through let stop pretending otherwise ', ' the marvels is disappointing and dull sequel to the much better captain marvel 2019 the film tries to juggle too many characters and subplots resulting in messy and incoherent story that lacks focus and direction the film follows carol danvers brie larson monica rambeau teyonah parris and kamala khan iman vellani as they team up to stop kree threat that involves mysterious wormhole and rogue skrull faction the film is directed by nia dacosta who fails to inject any flair or originality into the superhero genre the film biggest problem is its lack of character development and emotional depth the three protagonists have little chemistry and personality and their motivations and arcs are poorly established and resolved carol danvers is reduced to bland and boring hero who has no personal stake in the conflict monica rambeau is generic and forgettable sidekick who has strained relationship with her aunt carol kamala khan is an annoying and naive fan girl who has crush on carol and idolises her as role model the film does not explore the potential of their powers or their identities as women of colour in male dominated world the film action scenes are also uninspired and repetitive relying on cgi and explosions to create spectacle the film does not offer any memorable or creative set pieces and the final battle is clich and anticlimactic showdown with generic villain the film humour is also forced and unfunny relying on cheap jokes and references to pop culture the film attempts to be relevant and progressive are also superficial and pandering as it tries to appeal to diverse and young audience without any substance or nuance the marvels is wasted opportunity to expand on the cosmic and fantastical aspects of the marvel cinematic universe it is bland and boring film that fails to deliver on its promise of being fun and empowering adventure it is film that does not deserve the title of the marvels give it two stars out of ten ', ' perfectly enjoyable superhero flick by comparison only the marvels is one of the weaker mcu movies there are still 6 releases that d rank lower mind but there still no doubting that had fun with this one brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani are trio that work well together vellani is especially good liked watching the story unfold it told in sharp enough fashion that wasn ever bored at what was in front of my eyes the more humerous stuff is solid the cat stuff particularly so the standout being the let them do their thing scene zawe ashton antagonist could ve been done bit better though think her dar benn is more than decent m intrigued to see where they head with that teaser of an ending ', ' it was really entertaining watched the behind the scenes and it made me like it more always love when the person playing the character was always fan of the character read some of the one star reviews and you could tell one person did even watch it they claimed it was made for tv retelling of captain marvel try again ', ' it seems that following the success of captain marvel disney decided to make another female lead marvel film because disney cares about feminism and social justice just like they care about tibet and xinjiang there was of course potential to make good film but they didn even try it was just cgi without any substantive plot it was almost like watching john wick film except this film was unironically being so shallow the script itself was also hollow dry and forgettable conversations between characters felt forced and were either used to inform the audience of information in very artificial tasting way or to just be filler for this hollow corporate production to take up the film timeslot so that disney could eventually cut to the chase of selling merchandise but hey we need to still respect this film because they sorta made it about women being strong and standing up against the only two three forgettable main male characters in the story right well no this isn a substitute for actually having storyline the real question we should take away from this film is whether it will take two months or two weeks for people to forget about it ', ' this show is good it has just started and everyone for some reason is giving one star rating it just started at least marvel is giving us new content every month to watch be great full and just watch the show ', ' well you have to watch it to understand the marvel universe they say but hallelujah this is disney and not marvel good luck watching it to bad just little bit more action would do the thing ', ' first thing holy crap does ever ever look like her mom while unfortunately not as ravishingly beautiful as milla was as pup literally recognized her as milla child and had never even seen her before and looked it up and sure enough tada wow some very genetic milla eyes always felt milla should have been cloned also appreciate what they tried to do casting natasha sister you want to get someone similarly proportioned but don want to outshine her which could be difficult given scarlett isn your typical supermodel build or beauty it would have been interesting to have seen oleysa rulin in the role tried my best to invest myself in the story but it was little simplistic and linear and by the time they got around to doing anything significant just didn really care what was happening anymore this sort of storyline concept would have done much better if it was drawn out into longer television series you could have put lot more stakes on the whole mind control thing and ultimately made the rest of the widows into characters worth fighting fighting for and saving here they try to condense the concept into film but what happens is just volley of plot information followed by bunch of action sequences and there is never much investment aside from the very forced attempt at the familiy drama surrounding black widow red guardian and the fam one of my biggest beefs with the decisions made making this film was opting to make all the characters speak with poorly imitated russian accent honestly at that point just have everyone speak english with their normal accents or whatever because the accents were so poorly acted that none of the characters could develop any semblance of nuance making them very cardboard like really wanted to enjoy this far more than ww1984 but it was very comparably mediocre it like they just want to throw budgets at fluff and see who comes to pay for it particularly with films of the superhero variety these days honestly post avengers men thor it feels like the well has run dry and sadly the best of the superhero films from the major comic companies are behind us and we re sliding into another superhero film dark age as the best the genre has to offer has now taken the form of tv series like the boys and jupiter legacy which follow in the footsteps of great series like heroes playstation network powers and netflix daredevil honestly black widow should have been series same budget longer investment and more depth to the story as is it wasn very interesting and certainly was no better than one of the hulk films which were widely considered bust though personally still very much enjoyed ang lee ', ' it about time when the mcu is starting to get heros from different regions and the story is just absolutely on an other level loved it appealing to the younger audience ', ' want to see again daredevil any movie aur series and wilson fisk after hawkeye best character and wilson have best villain background storyline m very impressed ', ' am writing this about the punisher but could be writing it about any of the shows aside from iron fist it starts dark brooding and serious program meant for adults moving between the heft of the actions that are committed and the ramifications on the lives they corrupt but ultimately it turns into show for kids with adult violence so skewing perfectly for those suffering from arrested development you watch each of the marvel series it is always the same death of character in the series ultimately results in the show becoming cartoony and losing any beauty it once had rinse repeat for each ', ' have watched all of mavels shows and movies but this could not watch any further have seen 1 5 episodes and just had to stop it was to boring it seems like it is amed for kids between 10 13 year of age ', ' decided to watch ms marvel thinking that it was going to be horrible based on others reactions but was surprised the show has some great moments but also has some cringe worthy moments that make me not want to watch it think this show isn for everyone but can see why people give it higher rating because it try to be different which is good time thing it too early to judge the whole show when we only have two episodes out but so far think it isn for me but m willing to watch it ', ' honestly just at episode 3 but it kinda boring the story line is weak too many characters trying to be the main it feels like it the bit of movie before the title scene but it just slowly moves along it not something think ll finish the season ', ' watched it not all that good at all for example why does hawkeye have more than enough arrows while fighting against the avengers but as he joins em in their fight runs out of arrows why does hulk go berserk against everything on the shield flying boat thing but fights with the avengers at the end without real reason given even saving iron man hawkeye isn even real super hero but hits with every arrow without even aiming at the end there a scene where he blindly shoots to his right of course hitting the target sorry for the random rant liked that film either way but could ve been better and of course spiderman was on vacation while new york was invaded by invincible aliens duh ', ' the direction seems good in the first episode but then the director goes into depression and gives up on the series any high school talent show would give leading actress an acting class it not too late for him to think about another career the series loops endlessly into itself without going anywhere you ll feel your life being sucked out as the couch drags you to the bottom of hell in short if you have the slightest bit of love for life never come close to this series or ignore my advice and agree with me in the future marvel used to be better ', ' must start with saying that this is the worst mceu movie of all dont know what they were thinking while making this everything here is way below marvel standard no storyline very plain acting fight scenes are not impressive at all they should be considering its black widow movie flat and uninteresting dialogues bad direction and screenplay everything is below average it was long wait for this movie and the end product we got after this much wait is disappointing one ', ' this show was awesome really enjoyed every minute of it was so mad when they cancelled it ', ' supposedly disney bought the marvel and lucasfilm ip because they had the disney princess market share locked down and wanted more male audience members they quickly destroyed the star wars property but for brief period it seemed that marvel might go by relatively unscathed with insanely good super hero movies like winter soldier and infinity war released after the purchase but the movies and shows were apparently lagging indicator with the comic book source material showing us where this property was actually heading skipping several decades of good characters and storylines kevin feige and victoria alonso have apparently decided to re enact the plot of thor ragnarok and cause the ultimate destruction of the beloved mcu by adapting new characters from the last decade that no one particularly likes and have decided to turn marvel into yet another disney princess property so what was the point of buying the marvel property in the first place if not simply to destroy it you had that market cornered already couldn you just have done another frozen sequel to profit from that audience am an adult male long time marvel comics fan really expected to watch this so can keep up with the serialized nature of the broader mcu cause that not gonna work out what is the point of this is disney marvel intentionally trying to get rid of the original pre disney marvel fanbase here an idea let compromise ll continue to watch ms marvel if disney hires me to direct the next frozen sequel and gives me free reign to do whatever want with it but after turning it into the unrated badlands natural born killers knock off that would personally want to see you still have to market it toward the original audience sound fair m genuinely looking forward to their new warriors film adaptation with snowflake safespace and the ultimate destruction of the marvel brand huffing all that internet gas has rotted this company brain ', ' the story is boring stupid and repetitive like all these movies so im guessing the fans connect to the fantasy of being super hero join the military take up martial art learn how to use weapon go help someone superheros and superhero movies are stupid ', ' live in indonesia and ve just seen it since it aired today the action scenes are good the de aging of early shield agents are great can really notice in seeing fury that it those are the good things about this movie brie larson comes off as snobbish when she quips like tony stark but became boring and unlikeable the more she does it there are moments in the action scenes when it all cgi that looks like it came from ps3 game comedy is sub par worth of nose exhale at least to quote laura clifford captain marvel is boring mishmash of ideas from score of other movies and franchises ', ' the first time saw this movie thought it was well crafted superhero movie but when seeing it the second time you start to pick up on somethings and it just isn that good now am not downing this movie since it not as entertaining as the first time seeing it but you just notice some weaknesses now when it comes to the plot there really isn anything all that original certain team needs to get their act together and not quarrel bicker and fight amongst each other in order to fight and win against battle or game when the odds are against them seem familiar because it has been done countless times but the execution is the most important thing and the execution for the movie is well done and entertaining most of the way through the final fight at the end is worth the price of admission however when it comes to the plot there really isn anything special that makes it stand out the plot and editing in john carter in my opinion is more well done than this in my opinion but unfortunately john carter didn do so well at all when compared to this movie now josh whedon did pretty good job when it comes to the marvel characters portrayed in this movie and stuck pretty close to the comic book materials but in the comics although the characters are arrogant there are other elements that turns it away from it being the main focus for this movie arrogance is the main part of what the characters face and is one of the biggest obstacle in their path what the avengers do is constantly have penis measuring competition with each other when the world is at stake anyways the fighting and action sequences are really entertaining and cool to watch some scenes are like superhero smackdown battles so those scenes were entertaining as well despite it all happening over arrogance and pride so that is why give this movie 7 8 10 7 8 10 ', ' this movie is among marvel best undeniably it holds true to its extended universe elevating marvel tradition of exceptional visual presentation coupled with new highly effective spy movie format this film is wonderful ride beginning to end it sends off natasha beautifully with excellent work from scarlett and particularly shining performance by florence pugh david harbour and rachel weisz are also delightful marvel is back and they ve brought much more to look forward to s would give it an 8 10 in reality but m doing my part to counter act the over reactors ', ' ve been waiting for this movie for soo long and must say this movie was fun and the acting was really great and everybody did their best and the action was amazing it felt so realistic in superhero movie if that made any sense wish could watch this in theatre ', ' captain marvel brie larson gets her powers muddled up with rambeau teyonah parris and khan iman vellani and together they must take on the villain dar benn zane ashton who is ripping open jump points in the space time continuum to transfer air water and light to her planet hala which was originally messed up by captain marvel whilst it has the advantage of being lighter and much shorter than your typical mcu blockbuster it also lacks the emotional heft of the earlier films it is therefore fun to watch at times with some enjoyable and indeed funny moments as well as some imaginative ideas the cats you ll know it when you see it but it is clearly missing something which includes plot which here is decidedly meh ', ' this movie was quite disappointment the acting is one of the worst things throughout the film kamala acting is so unbearably bad the dialogues are also so terribly written especially for kamala teenagers don talk anything like that the cgi was alright but quite bad at times like when carol is flying at full speed don usually care about the music but the music in this movie is so bad and terribly chosen the plot is also extremely predictable the whole fight with dar benn was so short and disappointing the singing in this movie was also so weird it felt like was watching princess movie the transitions are also appalling and outdated ', ' the taskmaster reveal was just too disappointing for me it was like placing apples instead of pineapples on hawaiian pizza though not everyone likes pineapples on their pizza but seriously if were to choose who should have don the taskmaster costume it would be the long lost brother of natasha romanoff mean the story was all about family and the backstory of the natasha then why not make someone from her unknown past join into the mcu in the comics natasha had brother named vindiktor romanov it would definitely be an exciting story to know more about this storyline the movie could have vindiktor transformed into the taskmaster by dreykov as part of his revenge to natasha for killing his daughter back in budapest with all of the brain washing experiments the red room has this would be an interesting story to venture on yelena story won be sidelined to the story as she is the sister natasha have grown to know with thus making sibling competition going into the story the ending would even be interesting as natasha finds out who the taskmaster is thanks to dreykov they fight in the end and taskmaster dies at the hands of natasha or did he this will make new story as future villain for yelena widow character or even better as team partner in the future thunderbolts team the character of taskmaster would have not gone into waste by poor storytelling for dreykov revenge natasha still dies in the infinity war yelena becomes the new black widow and vindiktor or maybe just rename him as viktor resurfaces with the taskmaster character in the future mcu story yes the movie was good but seems rushed and was not fully intended for natasha backstory but simply to introduce yelena into the mcu it could have been better with nat biological brother as the taskmaster but mcu missed this chance ', ' let me first say that am not professional reviewer though am fan of good tv and absolutely love marvel based superhero cinema and television am disappointed with netflix jessica jones about halfway through the series was troubled that very little back story was provided for jessica jones and killgrave only flashbacks and dull conversion focused on the main cast past interactions with the villain the show starts nowhere and goes nowhere in my opinion watched because was waiting for something to happen also very little references to other superheros and the alien invasion to compare and conclude that jessica jones is equal to or better than daredevil or any superhero tv series is travesty this is missed opportunity for what could been an exciting tv series unfortunately because of my one sided opinion cannot even complaint krysten ritter efforts not because of her abilities but because she given poor clich ridden script ', ' had very high expectations for this movie after seeing that it got 8 5 10 on rotten tomatoes needless to say this movie was disaster 65 of the movie was full of them talking about how they are going to kick some ass while the other 35 was them actually doing the deed this movie ending was very predictable and was like every other superhero movie ever created can not imagine why someone would give this terrible film rating greater than 1 10 had very high expectations for this movie after seeing that it got 8 5 10 on rotten tomatoes needless to say this

like every other superhero movie ever created can not imagine why someone would give this terrible film rating greater than 1 10 bad pitiful terrible horrible ', ' the avengers is what we all dream about on reading those superhero comics and watching the movies we always would love the concept of having all superheroes assembled and fighting for justice and that if such thing happens nothing ever could happen to our planet earth however rational thinking would suggest putting them all in one basket would make movie making quite difficult since the logistics of bringing an all conquering villain along with the bonding of the superheroes would change the dynamic of the superhero movie concept and can be double edged sword if not handled properly certainly they cannot make movie where the heroes are summoned to fight evil and they come and finish the job and they leave it has to be more complicated than that for the movie to succeed and it is hats off to the director and writers of this movie since they not only have villain who is manipulative evil and quite powerful with his own army who can provide quite challenge to the heroes but also have handled well the tricky scenarios of putting all the heroes in the same room hulk iron man and thor are all used to fighting outside of the law as vigilantes in their own movies these three would normally have no problem working together the bonding between ironman and hulk was depicted aptly since they are both scientists and vigilantes however the presence of captain america black widow and hawk eye who are all used to following orders and work for the law within this mix creates lot of tension in the air when they start interacting the blame games and one liners are on and believe me the one liners from rdj are really cracking all this makes for compelling first half obviously the second half is all about how they work together to destroy the enemy its predictable but its fun and visually awesome as well visually its spectacle and must be watched in 3d the movie is not without its cons though for one really thought with loki as the villain thor should have had better role to play unfortunately he was severely under utilized scarlett is given an expansive role should say her body in that tight fighting outfit is awesome she is hot which sometimes even outshines captain america and the rest watch it even if its not awesome or amazing or whatever you will certainly enjoy the ride ', ' absolutely love marvel movies however this was just dire the plot and twists were completely predictable made no contribution to the overall story arc and frankly was just boring that a first for marvel movie the lead actress is was overrated in terms of popularity and talent ', ' the avengers was movie have wanted to see since was little kid have dreamed of seeing captain america thor and the hulk on the same screen doing what they do best and the the avengers didn let me down it is by far the most well made super hero movie have been able to watch first don get me wrong like the dark knight series but with the mixture of cg animation and live action flowing so well together had hard time figuring out what wasn real in the scene that what want to see movie where can see exactly what is real and what fake the avengers lived up to it hype the acting within the avengers was couldn have been called anything but perfect with the great one liners and the impressive skill each line is delivered couldn have expected it to be better even enjoyed watching samuel jackson in this film and that is something very rare for me with the acting my biggest fear was each character fighting for the screen time and didn get that from any of them they molded themselves into one unit that rocked the audience ', ' thus far the series is huge disappointment with all the fanfare backing marvel not to mention financing they can write better material pilot episodes should drag you in and this didn do much for me other than feel like typical episode glad don have to pay to view this the bad acting should be balanced with phenomenal plot development and some type of mutant super power each episode ditch agent phil car for better character special effects are costly so introduce more cameo that show the human face of major heroes heroines computer hacking is an invisible plot device maybe go virtual bit more to engage the audience interview the writers of smallville to find out why nearly every episode was awesome ', ' comparing to all other marvel movies this is the worst story is poor you know it just not fit marvel story its not about blowing cars and the building or showing coool vfx if story is bad you not fill the movie think stan lee would be disappointed ', ' this show has stellar cinematography and decent cast but is dragged down by the really bad plot and writing tried giving it try and by the third episode was out of it phase 4 of the mcu has been subpar in comparison to other phases of the franchise and has turned well written story driven cinematic universe into boring repetitive dull cameo driven pile of garbage the first episode was the best of the show with all the following episodes just being horrible ', ' while this is perfectly decent movie it certainly is not the 10 out of 10 some people seem to think it is worthy of victim of the over hyped build up by the studio maybe to be frank found all the avengers themselves lived up to expectations but the overall storyline and plot was not worthy of the super heroes so many have come to love and adore the truth is that with so many central characters their opportunity to shine is limited no matter how well they play their roles the dark knight is in my opinion the pinnacle of the super hero genre so far and the avengers doesn come close sorry guys know will have offended few marvel maniacs with that comment but it really is true if you look deep enough within yourselves the dark knight is one of the best films of all time the avangers is not plain and simple worth watching but not worth the wait iron man captain america are at least equally as good in their own right ', ' lmao through most of what could watch love watching daw act she has great screen presence and foggy is wonderful character disclosure did not come to this after reading current marvel comics but this story arc was so humorous and guess if we were to extrapolate the comics to the screen we would have to have this over the top action and unbelievable acts because they are after all action heros but the kingpin character was entirely entertaining now did fast forward through most of this and managed to finish 3 seasons in couple hours without missing much of anything proceed with zero expectations and enjoy but no way does this get more than 5 stars ', ' this was good show for children but definitely not for an adult audience grandkids all huddled around to watch struggled to even find hint that could enjoy this as am the only marvel fan since the 60 in the household definitely not character who will fit into the larger universe as portrayed think this would have been better as cartoon on the disney basic channel ', ' was so looking forward to series 2 after thoroughly enjoying series 1 however the moment that insufferable actress giorgia whigham amy made her appearance began to lose hope have no idea what she is doing in this series she brings absolutely nothing to the storyline but spends her time loafing around like little girl lost occasionally pretending to look interested recall seeing her in an episode of that other american soap opera for the intellectually challenged supernatural and she was quite dreadful suggest that any money she makes from this appearance she puts towards acting lessons was hoping that she would get bumped off but as she is still here in episode 11 fear that am to be disappointed apart from that the rest of the series is just repetitive and overly violent in my opinion think the decision to make this the last series is sensible one ', ' last evening went to see this movie but it wasn worth the watch watched the tv show mrs marvel and was curious what this movie could add to storywise they could add this story as maybe 3 more episodes to mrs marvel instead of making movie of it hate to say it but seeing brie larson act is pain for the eyes everytime just big eyes and an awkward facial expression like she didn know what to say or how to act people are right to say that marvel is in downward spiral no descent storywriting everything after endgame is bad like marvel doesn know how to move on it repeating past stories ', ' this whole movie was cheesy as heck the concept overall was decent but the execution was completely off sure hope marvel does not let this director do anything else they will regret it deeply ', ' with black widow going solo was not expecting to see something that looked like superhero movie what we get here is an action flick on higher scale not as high as say captain america the winter soldier but that the level they were reaching for but never get there that has lot to do with the fact that black widow could have done some more action in the action film in films with other avengers black widow gives superb action sequence some of the sequences here felt incomplete too much cutting in between the action and the talking not something you want to do in an action film really there was lot of talking lot of understandable talking yes but at the same time wanted to see red guardian do some more captain america stuff not sure how feel about florence pugh good as fellow black window funny when it comes to poking fun of natasha romanoff and her being an avenger but the chemistry between pugh and johansson did not hold the movie as needed ray winstone villainy is step back maybe purposely as the movie takes place in the past not his fault for his portrayal of general dreykov it just that once marvel reached perfection with thanos its hard to watch them turn back to only the hero journey matters and not the foil they face was waiting for the task master to make it onto the silver screen for minute not what was expecting but not fully disappointed just left me wanting more want to point out that this movie is one step up from captain marvel know it should mean nothing but there was very little thing in black widow that was expecting captain marvel to be all about have to admit though did love this action movie but as marvel movie just felt it was missing lot of parts it was cool when they referenced things talked about in other movies but then you had things in the movie that needed to be addressed more overall thought scarlett johansson showed mastery of the character it may not look like it but she was everything expected from black widow plus we got to see her origin played out and as such it was fond farewell to the character ', ' the mcu has gone bit downhill in recent days but this tv show started in the absolute best era for the marvel brand it seemed to effortlessly fit into the films world it took few episodes for it to really get going and for you to really develop interest in the characters but that first season really finishes strong nonetheless admittedly the last couple of seasons got tad out there but their quality was still good my biggest complaint was their misuse of the agent carter character brought in in the last season alas with end game being what it was m sure they were given instructions from on high about that ', ' as the subject states this was the worst marvel film ve watched in my entire life terrible story terrible acting constant bombardment of lame soul sucking jokes ll never watch another captain marvel movie again paid 25 bucks to see it in 4dx m not sure if it was the theater however they blamed the movie the filmed lacked bass lows you could hear the vocals very well but no bass marvel please quality over quantity please save the slapstick humor for thor we don need the lame jokes in every marvel movie also please hire skilled actors love that you re trying to incorporate diverse talent but they need to be talented ', ' ve always wanted to watch tv show that contains serious villain real crimes and not that special superhero powers huge message for the people who dislike or maybe step back from blind person you must respect everybody characters have their weak moves of reality sense but sometimes even art can save souls and there are many points from the plot that love but they would be spoilers great job in acting by the lead roles the script is almost perfect there are some sins and we know there is no movie without sin didn like the ending and the main reason it would be that watch the whole season less than weekend or it would be that the writers didn have options for season 2 which definitely am going to see 10 10 positive reviews by nas neychev ', ' brie larson has the acting range of tommy wiseau from the room even my wife felt restless throughout and wanted to walk out half way through the only reason for 2 stars is that the movie slightly picks up on the action in the second half skip watching this in the big screen and watch it for free on flight instead ', ' am from india and really loved the cultural roots and everything but absolutely hated the series binge watched it and it was so hurtful its like watching spoof with no plotline and dumb have no idea why they decided to make series out of it instead of introducing kamala khan in the upcoming captain marvel sequal and now am having second thoughts of watching the movie ', ' liked it and binged it just some good ol action ', ' it a huge desspointment when look back to the other marvel shows this feels like it been made only for childrens overacting is the most devestating part of this entire series ', ' the origin story of ms marvel thought the art direction overall aesthetic and casting choices were excellent as well as the portrayal of kamala kahn family and heritage however the actual plot and story is quite mess with several plot holes and what feel like inconsistencies nevertheless the series does end on high note ', ' not as bad as we were led to believe but very perfunctory certainly does not create new leader for the mcu as for the rest orange cat good ', ' this show is nether the worse nor the best show ever but it leans more towards worst just little it started very slowly and was hoping in would start reving up into something interesting instead it bogged down developed plot holes and sequences that just didn work the actress who is playing kamala is killing it but she can save this show from bad writing and directing ', ' bitter sweet goodbye this review is overdue because to write it meant finally had to say goodbye to the jessica jones created under the netflix banner have really enjoyed this series the writing has been sharp self depreciating and grimly humorous like it protagonist krysten ritter has brilliantly inhabited this character the first season of jessica jones was my second favourite netflix produced marvel tv series daredevil season one was my 1 unlike daredevil and his team jessica jones outlook on life is not optimistic she battles internal as well as external demons season one and season two are very different from one another so brace yourself the former is about finding team family the latter is about the dissolution of family team and perhaps redefining of family the acting is good david tennent is getting too good at playing the villian the dramatic tension in both stories is palpable the third season was more about what heroism is or does than it is about fight against villainy as is always true with the series the struggle is real and the lines hard to define even though this season had slow start it must have been hard to reset after killgrave all the avenues were explored great writing great plot characters in whom you can invest bitter sweet finale to series truly enjoyed give this season 9 superb out of 10 but give the whole series 10 the best out of 10 superheroine ', ' it really really great feeling to see natasha on the screen again for the last time and undoubtedly she deserved this had it been released in 2014 or before timeline the entire setup and rage for black widow would ve been way higher keeping this aside won say it is one of mcu best but enjoyed bw barring few hiccups in the middle with patchy cgi in couple of scenes cgi part could ve been lot better in the last act as it spoiled the real fun grounded fight sequences would ve made this one more effective as we are pretty aware of bw strengths scarlet is black widow and she served it right all these years being an avenger and seeing her in action again for the last time is really different feeling don know about others but whenever she is in action mode with her kickass pose it gave me good vibes and when yelena uttered you re poser was like yeah she is and we love it when she does it of course jo excelled in her role as usual wanted more of natasha stuff here as it is the last movie but fine kind of satisfied young nat protecting her little sister yelena in the beginning is indeed beautiful scene loved jo and florence bonding such delight florence pugh got great debut in mcu she literally grabbed the opportunity and showcased her talent with her fierce performance and attitude as yelena loved her one of the finest additions to the mcu no doubt and m pumped up to see her in future marvel projects let protect yelena and kate bishop hailee 3 lovely rachel weisz good to see her and did her part as melina along with david as red guardian expected lot with taskmaster part but it is letdown over all nat yelena show all the way and it is good ride that post credit scene though intriguing final bid adieu to natasha romanoff aka black widow 3 love ', ' believe those who are marvel comics fan agree with me that all this year from iron man to end game there was solid storyline where we have such strong background this kind of work is not acceptable can explain all but think everyone noticed these like story character buildup dialogues etc hope next time marvel will focus on those things ', ' after countless delays we finally get another mcu film on the big screen on for the first time in two years the good the cast in here is amazing scarlet johansen has never been better in this role than she is here and love the relationship which she forms with her family david harbour and florence pugh absolutely run the show here and honestly wish that they were introduced earlier this film is all about family and where black widow came from and honestly love that aspect and what they were able to do with it all the action is filmed in way in which really love and is film that just keeps going and never has slow moment the bad wish it came out after civil war instead of endgame also didn like taskmaster he just felt like throwaway character compared to how big of character he is in the comics in the final battle lot of the special effects just looked chap or you can tell straight away that it is green screened now these are only small issues had with the film and didn take away from any enjoyment from the film overall thoughts cate shortland made an almost perfect black widow film with amazing performances wonderful action just wished it came out couple of years earlier overall m going to give black widow 9 10 ', ' daredevil will be the first live action adaptation of marvel universe which actually is dark although it borrows heavy influence from christopher nolan work on batman films but still it raises above significantly from other recent marvel work for both tv and movies which are totally commercial and senseless except for captain america which is better then the rest marvel has made movies mostly about costume action and adventure but daredevil has more drama and intense action which makes it different then its predecessors performances by charlie cox deborah ann woll and rosario dawson are worth watching too ', ' story 2 10 cgi 2 5 10 characters 1 10 acting 3 10 music 0 5 10 action 2 10 made an imdb account just to review this rubbish like whose idea was this hope that ms marvel will not appear in future marvel movies story is extremely boring and weird jokes are so cringe wanna dissapear the stereotype of old lady being close to her phone like that was so bad and unfunny ', ' am big fan of marvel but this tv series is just really awful after watching the first episode gave up my hope for this tv series the cast is really bad except for coulson and the story is like for small children 12 or below admire those people who watched the whole season and survived this tv series because gave up after watching the first episode the show might improve if they added some awesome superheroes also agent ward and skye is so annoying sorry joss whedon but this might be the worst tv series you made for those who are planning to watch this please do not and save yourselves remember what has been seen cannot be unseen this text is just nothing so just ignore it ', ' as far as marvel movies have gone in the past their history is eh sketchy at best but since the avengers timeline bust it way into our screens they have undoubtedly grown and grown in cinematic splendour personally believe everyone likes well made buddy action movie and this is exactly that the marvel universe has made this feature in my mind essentially perfect containing mild feel good humour riviting story line well played roles by well loved actors absolutely mind blowing special effects and jaw dropping goosebump inducing sense of nostalgia that links you directly to your youth irregardless of age or interest in the comic books themselves put it this way folks your kids will adore it and you will also ', ' lot of new previously unseen content and story has been presented here very nicely change from the usual regular stories the first few episodes build characters and the later episodes build on deep story amazing the story feels bit rushed episode 5 could have been longer some amazing intense acting in there the graphics are amazing and the fight sequences in episode 4 are marvel great show especially for younger audiences and underrepresent region ', ' beautifully shown the new black widow the movie was so exciting and cool thanks marvel ', ' complete trash meant for 10 yrs old audience no real story that give you the obsession to watch more episodes please re consider your career as writers ', ' promise am not exaggerating when say that the avengers is probably the best superhero action film ever made from start to finish it amazing m sure everyone knows that besides the dark knight every other comic book film adaption has always has it flaws each movies not being quite there yet but believe me when say this movie is the epidomy of what superhero film is supposed to be joss whedon and zak penn are definitely knowledgeable in writing solid script the plot of course is your typical action film sinister bad guy wants to take over the world and the hero must rise to the occasion and protect earth and mankind before it too late with these type of movies don believe that there needs to be complex over the top plot so if you re expecting something like the matrix or inception you came to the wrong movie first of all every actor embodies their character with such an ease that they were all joy to watch on screen robert and both chris are definitely iron man thor and captain america without shadow of doubt but was really impressed with scarlett johannsen and mark ruffalo portrayal of black widow and hulk the last two hulk movies were okay but ruffalo definitely gave the hulk more depth as character hulk stole the screen every time he was on camera was sad when people booed him after finding out he would be playing the hulk but think his performance left everyone in the movie happy but black widow her cameo and fight scene in iron man 2 definitely made me say this girl is bad ass but got chance to see more of an emotional side of this deadly assassin even though she is lethal there were moments where her eyes would water in the midst of situation and you re like damn love this girl because you feel connected but must say tom hiddleston played an awesome villain may get shot for saying this but thought his performance was right up there with ralph fiennes in his portrayal of voldemort in the harry potter saga also jeremy renner as hawkeye was very impressive and shocker some people didn think his character needed to be in this film but renner definitely proved them very wrong an inhibition have with lot of action films is two things either theirs lot of action but no story character development or their lot of story and character development but not lot of action this movie has both thank you mr whedon every action scene is superb and memorable in it own way unique way it seems like lot of directors like to rush the editing and the story and even the action scenes when there is lot to cover but whedon definitely took his time and made sure the audience was in the moment with each of the character by the way love good standoff moment and the part in the end where all six heroes are standing in circle back to back and the camera is panning around them totally epic the special effects were also amazing and seemed almost real know lot of thought has to go into planning very intricate fight scenes when the it involves six to nine heroes fighting dozens of soldiers or an alien army of hundreds but every shot every action every move was definitely well thought out really wonder how long it took them to film that final battle it was probably the best ve ever seen in my life even though im only twenty three think the best part of this entire movie was that it was laugh out loud funny from start to finish joss whedon definitely has sense of humor and of course each actor brings their character to life and it makes you relate to them as they spit out sarcastic dry arrogant humor to each other it was fun to watch because it was like seeing family bicker during thanksgiving dinner seeing all six heroes together in one room arguing non stop over differences was great on screen chemistry think when directors make an action movie with team they fail to show the connection between them what makes them team why do they stick together but loved the group dynamic it was like struggle of egos in the beginning which was definitely realistic in my own opinion this movie is flawless anybody who finds something wrong with it is probably just uptight or dc universe fan and are scared that the new batman film won gross half as much as the avengers will tell everyone that the best way to enjoy movie is to go in with no expectations and take it for what it is played the avengers game on sega genesis with my brothers when was little but had no extensive knowledge of anything remotely connected to the avengers but this film has made me big fan thank you joss whedon for setting the bar higher than high and letting these other hollywood directors know that they better step their game up or find job at their local mcdonald joss whedon chris evans robert downey jr chris hemsworth mark ruffalo scarlett johansen jeremy renner tom hiddleston samuel jackson and the rest of the cast thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing the world why chose to go to film school left the theater overjoyed and m an men fan hahaha ', ' absolutely poor storyline with unnecessary side plots which don seem to really blend with the central story jessica jones is both weak and strong the series could have closed in perhaps 5 episodes which unnecessarily drags for 13 episodes if only jessica could behave like superhero and take care of the bad guys ', ' by far the worst movie ve ever seen didn expect much as just went with 2 friends who wanted to see marvel film terrible special effects awful acting cringey jokes embarrassingly bad fight scenes and storyline if you can call it that to make you want to jump off bridge even if you were getting paid to watch this movie would still say no as it not worth the torture you will have to go through during the experience would of left the cinema early especially when they all started to sing but one of my friends actually enjoyed it and wanted to watch it maybe suitable for 11 years old and under ', ' poorly executed and forced to add nothing to marvel universe you only need to see the extra scene ', ' what bad acting by scarlet if it wasn for florence this would have been 1 star florence was the only reason it was an okay movie plot is too predictable and special effects often out of cue ', ' as obscure as the idea and premise is this show is absolutely brilliant funny action packed and well thought out each episode leaves you wanting more of you are fan of adult cartoons such as rick and morty family guy american dad south park or more this is definitely show for you the story revolves around vengeful japanese snow monkey and the ghost of an american assassin who embark on mission to cut down tokyo underworld m sure many fans like will be hoping this show is renewed for second season and many many more beyond that if you watch anything this autumn watch this more please ', ' ve been waiting months for this movie must say was very disappointed in this film m big on comic book movies and love scarlett johansson but this film was lazily written liked the action but the plot was rushed and it may put certain people to sleep come on marvel ', ' so much build up and it all leads to this and it awesome know m late in reviewing this and everything has been said in all kinds of praise and this movie deserves it just see it even if you don like comic book movies see it what find amusing is that ironman was never really the top billing of the avengers it was always captain america until now robert downey jr steals every scene that his name is first on the credits seriously he that awesome was also surprised with mark ruffalo performance as the hulk he was great his scenes with robert downey jr are some of the most memorable also haven seen the thor flick but the guy who played them was really good and really seemed into character hawkeye was cool and scarlett johanssen is hot okay the plot bad guy named loki wants to take over the world and does really good general zod impression kneel before me and avengers try to stop him what funny is that he looks tough in the beginning but then turns into rag doll at the end just ask the hulk and whatever injustice the previous movies had done to the hulk certainly makes up for it here just see it it a lot of fun and it what summer movies are supposed to be it a great beginning to summer movies m glad went ', ' alphas was great tv show cancelled last year about team of government superheroes taking down super villains they achieved greatness with limited budget yet giving us great effects likable characters good story lines and villains you wanted to hate basically it gave us everything agents of shield is missing aos is so clich its joke none of the cast gel together they have no main villain and the weekly villain doesn feel like threat worthy of their attention local police should be going after kidnap victims and serial killers aos are suppose to be bigger than that there spy team yet chuck could beat them all without breaking sweat none of the team have any powers or any unique skills what skills they are suppose to have they never use two scientists who haven done any science stuff yet computer hacker who hasn done anything twelve year old couldn do on their phone coulson is just guy with gun most likely lmd by the way you have the knockoff captain america guy who has shown zero spy skills gadgets or stealth its just struggle to watch they live on plane which is stupid for so many reasons there is absolutely nothing spy team about them and other than the logo there are zero similarities between this shield and the one featured in the comics or the movie the pacing is slow don care about anyone and just want it to get better love marvel own all their films tv shows and comics really really want to like this show and yet its becoming chore to have to watch it please make some abrupt changes asap please introduce superhero onto the team or at least look at other marvel superheroes to feature in the story please give us recurring villain who is worthy of an international spy organisations attention ill continue to watch as m marvel junkie but should be desperate for the next episode instead of dreading how it will insult me next ', ' no entertainment whatsoever storytelling is monotonous marvel is only thinking about progressing its narrative and not anymore on entertainment adding pakistani backdrop just checks the diversity box for marvel and does nothing else to make it interesting for the audience ', ' if any marvel movie could be accused of being written by ai the marvels would be the strongest candidate for this the 2023 big budget bomb is an example of everything that wrong with the direction that the mcu is going in nia dacosta take on the adventures of captain marvel miss marvel and professor marvel as they learn to harness their collective powers to stop the new kree leader from wreaking havoc on planetary systems is as vanilla of storyline as you ll get the acting screenplay and even the special effects make this feel more like disney original than theatrical release and it hard to understand what the point of this film was best guess is it merely vehicle to link the mcu of old with the new disney fied era which is not step in the right direction there not much more to say about this film ', ' this is the best show ve seen jon berthonal gives an outstanding performance and fills the role of the punisher perfect him as well as most of the cast were great you can ask for better performances than this the writing and story is surprisingly good and kept me engaged from start to finish across both seasons an impressive feat this coming from someone who thinks 99 of everything that comes out of hollywood is complete garbage in the writing department ve not read any of the comics so it kinda new to me even though caught the 2004 movie really liked how he and several characters had military background and that was tied deeply into the story it made everything more realistic and you know he a badass ex marine and can take out anyone it not just an action flick it has plenty of that for sure but what makes the action scenes come alive is everything in between you get real sense of motivation and purpose why they do what they do from both sides nothing is left to the imagination no major plot holes there are some moments where you could go hmm what his problem but for the most part the story tries to rationalize hostility as much as possible so the bad guys aren just bad guys for the hell of it nothing is more annoying than bad guy that makes no sense at first kind of glazed over the first seasons episodes but the later part really caught my attention and realized how good this show was ended up rewatching the first season and then truly appreciated how good it was or at least how bad it wasn i have hard time watching anything on netflix these days just finished s2 and it was on par with s1 in most regards except lot of it revolves around some annoying stupid girl that you just wish she go away is that mean really hate this choice of characters to play in the main story across all episodes and find myself trying to ignore the show when she is on screen don care what she has to say she stupid we ve already established that why would want to continue to listen to her she not likeable in any way and has an attitude from start to finish hope to god we never see her again ', ' here why the avengers fails so badly 1 wrong wrong director joss whedon is tv director serenity worked because it was essentially tv movie and he has here made the avengers tv movie bad move this should have gone to j abrams bryan singer or brad bird 2 dreadful miscasting only robert downey junior can hold his head high chris evans is as wooden in this as the flat captain america film those playing thor hulk black widow either phone in performances or look embarrassed 3 weak weak villain tom hiddleston plays slight camp character who offers little panache or interest and more closely resembles spoiled teenager than anything else this film needed general zod 4 too much obvious cgi come on it 2012 there no excuse for the george lucas effects like the flying shield craft graphics 5 no drama tension and script so obviously flat that whedon inserts misplaced self conscious quips to lighten the tone for anyone growing up with marvel comics in the 70 chime with me on this we deserved so much more for younger audiences it will pass m sure really can understand though the positive reviews am alone in this ', ' as reflect on my experience tonight watching the avengers one word comes to mind awesome the movie was simply awesome the action scenes were the best ve seen in any recent movie and the comedy was excellent it seems that super hero movies these days have become parodies of themselves and for that reason the movies are even better the audience and the actors are all in on the jokes together and for that the audience feels delighted and laughs to make the greatness of this movie more relatable here is list of things that are equal to the movie in excellence 1 donald trump commitment in losing battle to prove obama african 2 obama actually being american 3 women sports 4 bashing women sports 5 powerful shower heads 6 shower head 7 the lifespan of the nintendo 64 8 the triple chinned woman working at burger king who wears grumpy shirt to let the customers know she is grumpy the woman is in fact grumpy you know what you re getting yourself into 9 that dude facial hair in the hunger games 10 having your cake and eating it too and then going to brag to your friends about the cake that you got to eat but they didn get to eat and then they tell you that all of those carbs and sugar will go to your hips and butt but you don believe them and you don really care because that cake was excellent hope you could relate to at least one of these excellent things to see just how great this movie really is it like mix between fergie and jesus not only will you enjoy this movie but the avengers will also solve many issues 1 relationship problems 2 erectile dysfunction those are actually all the problems this movie will solve in conclusion this movie was awesome and spoiler alert scarlett johansson is gorgeous in this film much love james harden s selena gomez if you are reading this cool ', ' like this show but don love it my main complaint is how the punisher is portrayed in this version he acts like an angry neanderthal with ptsd now before people spit out their drinks and their pants over what just said let me be clear the way he acts makes sense given what happen to him just don like jon bernthal rendition of it my favorite portrayal of the punisher was played by thomas jane he was cold calculating and vengeful but he kept cool head he didn fly off the handle in an insane rage like jon bernthal does which by the way jon bernthal always seems to do in every movie he in he just doesn seem as smart as thomas jane punisher he comes off more as angry dumb grunt then methodical lethal intelligent special forces killer like said jon portrail is fine it makes sense understand why people like it it just not my cup of tea ', ' really tried to get into this show but as of late marvel has been catering to the woke agenda and just trying to convert every mcu superhero into woman role the acting is horrible in this show and it so boring even the action scenes are bland the worst outing for marvel hands down ', ' several reviews referenced how this movie doesn coincide with the real timeline these people are idiots this is comic book movie of course the natasha history is different are you basement dwelling morons serious my god it a freaking movie stop acting holier than thou will never understand you fake purists either the movie is good or it garbage you trolls should be grateful that there is even movie for you watch it insulting that you wet behind the ears dopes give negative reviews grow up and be thankful you are not privileged hell you are not even special you are misguided spoiled brats and honestly everyone one of you are huge joke your opinion doesn mean dick especially because you have not earned one watched this film fifth time and if an intelligent person were to try and see this from the victims perspective one may see what the filmmaker was trying to say ', ' mean didn expect much from movie that came out decade late but black widow still managed to disappoint me the story was basic and black widow was inhuman they also managed to destroy great character like taskmaster the only good part was yelena don watch this trainwreck ', ' the first episodes are like the 80s cartoons then they tried to make them serious it didn worked they still pushed that dead donkey at least for 4 years ', ' don listen to the neckbeards who write negative reviews of this 90 of them are so focused on the comicbook storyline that if the show deviates in the brand of boots main character wears they ll riot this is quite possibly one of the best netflix series ever made easily the best when it comes to the marvel offerings this is definitely the first time that frank castle has been portrayed well he a multi dimensional character living through the pain sorrow and regret of his past he fighting with the demons of whats left in his life advise anyone interested in this show to at least watch the last few episodes of daredevil season 2 to get introduced to the punisher character properly while the new show wont be bad without it there is some continuity and characters that will be re introduced the story is woven brilliantly painfully some of the items are bit predictable but thats the case with hollywood this is one of the most action filled shows ve ever seen struggling now to figure out whats next to watch frank castle the punisher is one of the best anti hero characters ever written this is for the fans of spawn and other similar series its dark definitely not kids program but it sucks you in and each episode is obsessively well paced worth watch there a reason why its rated 9 10 ', ' just came out of watching the marvels do not understand why so much hate it not end game but it certainly is not the worst marvel movie either the movie is okay thoroughly enjoyed while was in the theatre was not bored single time maybe the end battle was not epic as we expect from this universe but it was fun needed multiple sittings to finish the love and thunder this was way more entertaining have watched all the previous series and the movies and kamala khan blooms in this movie from the lost jersey city girl we know her as darben is way prettier in the movie than in the preview as well previews did not do her justice she sounds great and fits the role fine all these hate to drown the movie seems somewhat coordinated if you dissect every single line spoken and every single logic they try to explain then maybe you should go watch something else if you like superhero movies and you are okay with eliminating half the universe with snap and bringing them back again after 5 years then you don really have an argument am glad went to see the movie in the theatre despite of all negative reviews laughed out many times some parts were sweet and some little sad certainly recommend this movie solid 7 for its entertainment value ', ' decided to rewatch the first two amazing season of this incredible show before watching the third season to get me refresher season 1 was great season 2 with the punisher was excellent and imagine my excitement when m about to watch the third season god it stinks dont know what happened to the directing but it got so lame and boring it so weak for the first 6 episodes almost dozed off got so dissapointed at the final fight scene it made me write this review bad bad bad directing editing lost all interest in the show maybe cancelling it was good call if it will be directed in the same manner s1s2 is gem but s3 ', ' the only good thing liked about this show was that luke cage mike colters was guest star on several episodes of the first season he brought ray of sunshine and good acting to the totally dead space that is jessica jones he also brought out positive attitude in the character of jessica jones when they were together the show was lot better the character of jessica jones is usually nasty whiny verbally abusive entitled angry and boring person who solves problems by punching them she is big jerk to everyone including her friends jessica jones is the most depressing and obnoxious character have seen in while she is financially broke because she is too lazy to work she rejects referrals often and only works on whatever tickles her fancy what little work she does consists of going to her laptop and downloading information by magic without any access codes she can get information about anything not even garcia from criminal minds could pull stuff out of thin air like this jones played by krysten ritter lives in filthy apartment that is gross by any tenement standards in the real world it would be crawling with bugs and other vermin she wears the same clothes every day she expects people to do things for her there is no explanation given as to why anyone thinks she is special jones has modest super powers that seem to be about beating up normal people jones super powers are kind of lame this tv series is 99 talking and whining and one action scene where she beats up random tough or neighborhood hoodlum jones even looks bored and suffering when she fights people like she cannot get her spirits up for anything her life is on full time suck mode it is depressing show to watch ', ' don understand why this entry in the mcu has received so much hate from viewers and people who haven bothered to see the movie before expressing negative opinion of it thought this was once of the better mcu movies it was funny and not super serious though the characters and plot were linked to the other movies series it was not so intertwined that viewers needed to watch all of the others to understand what was going on with the exception of ragnarok and the ms marvel series most of the later mcu properties have been too serious and definitely too long this one was joy ', ' they re almost all men ve seen people say the movie has too many fight scenes and that there are not enough fight scenes that the actresses are lazy and that the men were better actors huh wonder what they re really trying to say ve heard people say the plot wasn good enough for black widow send off for some of those people they might genuinely believe that but for others it a thin veil to disguise their dislike of female driven movie and honestly neither of them really understand this movie this could not have been better send off to natasha admittedly the action sequences were not as polished as captain america the winter soldier but that an incredibly high bar black widow cgi was no worse that infinity war or endgame it was believable enough to be good and to have me thoroughly engrossed and impressed it was lot of fun and each of the characters had moments to shine as absolute bad asses natasha in particular the humour was entertaining and genuinely had me laughing if you have siblings you ll totally understand and the found family trope was actually very well done definitely better than the limp attempts made by whedon and the russo brothers in whedon avengers they barely had time to feel like family before he and the russos started ripping them apart with black widow to avoid spoilers all ll say is that there was tension and the characters were complex and flawed but the film doesn forget what its main themes are loved it as for the plot again to avoid spoilers ll be vague if you re woman m sure you ll agree with me that the villain is an absolutely vile creature both terrifying and for many of us so very real if you know and understand natasha romanoff as character at all you understand that this movie this mission is the most important and most personal one she ever been on bar the one in endgame of course and don listen to the criticisms about yelena she perfect she does an excellent job of being the device that propels natasha plot and at the same time she a fantastic character they all are to be honest of course there were some minor flaws but show me single action movie or any movie for that matter which doesn have few niggles here and there overall this was great way to say goodbye to my favourite avenger and for one finished the movie feeling thoroughly entertained and haven stopped thinking about it since don listen to the haters they don get it ', ' really disappointed with what marvel is being making these days couldn watch it for more than 15 mins it just boring and boring it looks like it just addition to mcu because of culture things but they didn really spend any thoughts ', ' am not into comic books have tried to follow some of the movies little bit but didn watch them all to know what was going on with everything what like about this show is that it can stand alone as it own show without anything to do with comics only remember jon bernthal in the walking dead and the punisher know have seen other shows he was in but don remember what he did in any of them thought he was mediocre actor at best in the walking dead just an ordinary actor nothing really made him stand out then in the punisher it like night and day difference maybe he needed to be the star of the show in order to bring something out in him think he does better than the other guys that have played the character in previous movies think this character fits him very well kind of doubt he could play more subdued characters as good like lot of tough guy movies the main character doesn have to say very much at time then there is josh stewart have seen him in few shows and always thought he looked really creepy remember him from criminal minds he is another one that doesn come across as much of an actor but excels in this show maybe he will be the new creep in slasher movies netflix puts on some excellent quality tv shows far better than their movies their movies are usually kind of lower quality and not always very entertaining ', ' all 4 stars just for black widow and her tight suit storyline is 6 year old fans of marvel ', ' after the first two seasons waited for the third for me the third season was predictable most of the time which isn the reason watched the first two seasons ', ' not marvel standard captain marvel is big disappointment expected more from marvel weak story weak acting cgi was ok larson couldn carry the weight of captain marvel ', ' had potential but the writing was clearly written by the producers of the kids programs acting was poor ms marvel was decent herself witty and her character development will get better but in the hands of decent directors overall an easy miss from marvel shame ', ' wow couldn even finish it it so bad so there only 1 boy in the marvel universe yes it an almost all girls show zero characterization ms marvel and others lack anything that makes them really special she feels like propaganda piece the way she keeps popping up even though she not all that popular the plot is dopey and this is their big marvel animated movie it was awful fun for very young girls maybe but they just targeted small portion of their audience with this one utter rubbish in the end ', ' nice to see bit of the back story to black widow cannot wait to see more of this story line ', ' definitely one of the better marvel movies funny punchlines logical actions amazing fighting scenes natural and believable human relations we laughed several times of the awkward but not clich lines from red guardian believe as seen in wonder woman 1984 the relatively low score to this movie is because the movie spent time focusing on human relations and not only fighting due to too much testosterone ', ' this movie is by far the worst mcu movie it almost seem like they they didn really care about this movie when they were making it nothing was interesting about this movie not her past or how she got her powers not nick fury accident if you know what mean not ronin not even where it left off the movie never had my attention to the point where thought hey that pretty cool ant man was way better movie and so was wonder women just in case people think m hating cuz she a women the expectation was very high for this movie and unfortunately it did not deliver considering it right before avengers maybe timing was big factor also if they would have done this film as one of the first ones don think it would have been that bad nonetheless it is definitely not worth watching in the theater it almost seemed like they targeted young girls who are working on their dreams as an audience and maybe inspire them not to give up who knows so many things wrong with this movie ', ' the first episode has me hooked with its unique camera angles creative formatting and colorful art throughout kamala is compelling and relatable character that can wait to see more of can wait to see what the rest of the episodes have in store for us ', ' for the past four years marvel studios has been building cinematic mythology based on their comic books for the first time combining different franchises into single canonical movie universe starting in 2008 with iron man and the incredible hulk to 2010 iron man 2 and finally last year thor and captain america there have been five films building in anticipation to this result the ultimate crossover experience in addition to those four heroes we are also given black widow hawkeye and nick fury bringing our team of heroes to about seven although fury isn a direct player so suppose the team stands at six this movie had lot to live up to it succeeded by god this was an awesome movie directed and co written by joss whedon 2012 the avengers is perfect payoff for fans who have been anticipating this film for over four years now beginning with fury samuel jackson arriving at shield hq the tesseract the asgard artifact used by red skull in last year captain america which has been under lock down for testing opens portal allowing loki tom hiddleston the outcast brother of thor to arrive on earth he steals the tesseract and uses his powers to brainwash several shield members including hawkeye portrayed by jeremy renner it is revealed that loki needs to the tesseract to open portal to allow an alien race to invade and conquer earth realizing they are in over their heads fury calls out to unite the three earthly heroes tony stark iron man robert downey jr bruce banner hulk mark ruffalo and steve rogers captain america chris evans after the team apprehends loki his brother thor chris hemsworth is sent back to earth completing our team when loki escapes and is finally able to open the portal the four heroes joined by scarlet johansson as black widow and redeemed hawkeye must band together despite their differences to defend the world in an ultimate battle the acting in this film is outstanding this really begins with our four leads there is no need to speak about downey he continues to play the role to perfection hemsworth and evans also are given lot of good material to work with in particular evans who gives the character of steve rogers subtle pain and pathos this time around despite having to be strong but the real revelation is mark ruffalo as bruce banner thought both eric bana and edward norton had given fine first class performances particularly norton who really made the role his own in big way but ruffalo surprisingly blows them both out of the water he makes the role of bruce banner and the hulk thanks to motion capture technology his own giving him humor and an incredible depth ruffalo is owed his own hulk movie now in addition the supporting performances are incredible the gorgeous johansson is given lot more to do in this film and she breaths great life into black widow to be honest black widow was at times more compelling than our four leads and johansson proves once again to be phenomenal actress clark gregg reprises his iron man and thor role as shield agent phil coulson and provides some great comedic moments in addition to being the shady government type hiddleston is menacing and dark as loki stellan skarsgard and gwenyth paltrow return in small roles as erik selvig and pepper potts and although their scenes are minor both ground the film emotionally the only slight problem had was with jeremy renner as hawkeye will say he gave fine performance but his role seemed somewhat underwritten in comparison with everyone else he felt little too expendable character and shoe horned in but renner was still good in the role the script by whedon from story he co wrote with zak penn is tight concise and an absolute blast there is lot of humor and do mean lot and ton of action although it never feels forced contrived or unneeded as fantastical as the story is it is grounded in it own sort of reality and logic and feels natural this is an extremely well written fun and generally light hearted film the visuals are blast whedon direction and camera placement is fun kinetic and serves as good companion piece to the other four directors who had previously helmed the individual films the effects are outstanding the sound design is great the score by alan silvestri is fun and memorable this is just competently made film and darned fine piece of entertainment will say that this isn necessarily the best film in the series think the first iron man felt tad more fresh and unique but this is still an absolute blast and you cannot afford to miss it on the big screen give the avengers near perfect 9 out of 10 assemble in line at the cinema and see it now ', ' the first season was fairly good the actors were still getting to know their character but slowly getting comfy with them here in season two they are comfortable with the character and the part they play but there are just to many story lines and they deviate too much from the comics frank castle aka the punisher is portrayed pretty poorly and instead of the pro elite soldier and vigilante he is in the comics they show him more as psychotic ex marine with possible ptsd and sadistic streak like that he most of the time come of as equal to dare devil though that a big in my book but all in all feel they should ve gone with ray stevenson as the punisher he looked more the part than any other have come so far an stuck to the original way punisher is they can seem to make up their mind if you should hate him or root for him but the saddest part is they have taken bunch of punisher stories and bunch of daredevil stories altered them here and there than thrown them in the script blender and ed it up they ve came up with this whole government conspiracy cover up of the murder of frank castles family stick was really cool in the first season he was sarcastic and funny and very much straight to the point and had little sympathy for daredevils squeamishness while here he is mostly reduced to backseat driving old man with stick and few tricks up his sleeve while electra take the front seat and not really in good way they ve focused to much on her and matt murdock romance which get boring really fast she is also very poorly played her sai swords which she doesn use until the two last eps you can clearly see is not sharpened pointy the ninjas was more comical than had expected and sadly poorly portrayed they had better movie ninjas in the 80s but it isn all bad even though it might seem like it they manage to make it entertaining by all means they just could ve made it so much better instead of going 180 degrees from season one they have gone in too many directions and made to may side stories that you really don need nor care about but matt murdock and foggy nelson really look good in their part no question about it just feel their should be more for them to work with ', ' first of with zero expectations we we re hoping to tell good story rather then focus on some internal family drama which we always see in all moves and tv well this show is so cringe that it needs full rewrites and also they are trying their best to show the lead is energetic and optimistic but that turn to more cringe ', ' basically obligated to watch it being sucked into the mcu but if this phase 4 mcu is plummeting down cliff then this was so mediocre and had such glaring plot holes m quite surprised marvel even allowed it to be released with their brand on it ', ' not many people outside of the comicbook community are aware of who jessica jones is but after this phenomenal series the entire world will know just who she is the story is even more gritty and dark with krysten ritter fitting the role of down trodden ex superhero private investigator perfectly mike colter as luke cage also smashing the moment that he uttered the words sweet christmas actually got chills because it shows that the adaptation paid homage to the comics without being an exact copy all of the pieces of the puzzle fit well for most of the season it only stumbled in few places and won mention those because it be spoilerific and we don need that david tennant as kevin kilgrave was nothing short of creepy witty and oh so british that happened to fit the character lot better than imagined and recall that lot of people were iffy because of his role as the tenth doctor and some doctor who fans even refuse to watch the show because of how eerily diabolical mr tennant is seen portraying kilgrave to them say get over yourselves and enjoy the damn performance because he made villainy into an art form well worth the price of admission the plot is slow build and think that is fantastic way to tell the stories that marvel set out to tell after the first few episodes if you aren hooked then you will be by the aforementioned point ', ' the movie was such huge box office success that tried really hard to like it just couldn just to be certain gave it second viewing and disliked it just as much the second time around firstly if you haven seen thor iron man captain america or the incredible hulk you ll have no idea who the characters are and what they re all about there haven been films about black widow or hawkeye so they don really matter anyway the film played like medley of all of these super hero movies and didn really offer anything we haven seen in these movies also due to way too many protagonists for one film none of them were given the opportunity to develop in fact found all the characters incredibly shallow and didn like any of them my favorite character in the film is probably hulk everything about this film was so overblown and overdone to the level where nothing was believable within the context of the genre off course the avengers was so cgi heavy that it was difficult to have fun with it the film also had so many plot flaws and credibility issues everything was simply done for effect at the disposal of an interesting plot iron man is just as annoying as in his own franchise although he is the deepest character of all so mere mortal in suit tony stark iron man can actually outwit god like thor wow not much hope for gods the same goes for the powerful god loki who is outwitted and outsmarted so easily the action in dragon wars and transformers was lot more realistic and more enjoyable than this ve seen it twice and that more than enough thanks ', ' it a catalogue of stupid people doing stupid things or more accurately stupid writers expecting stupid viewing public to accept stupid storylines alan moore they most definitely are not you know the sort of thing villain is captured and escapes thanks to stupid people he captured again and escapes thanks to stupid people he captured and escapes thanks to stupid people yada yada yada contrived contrived contrived whether that comes from the original comic which haven read and have no intention of doing so or the tv script don know d suspect the script but the resulting series is far too long with simply not enough story to sustain it it a 5 part series not 13 oh dear oh dear oh dear david tennant dr who to uk viewers is annoyingly smugly entitled as indeed his character is supposed to be and yes his eyes are close together but acting honours must go to the lead krysten ritter who plays superbly against an often uninspired infuriating and boring script how many times she must have asked with genuine honesty and puzzlement what the heck my motivation for this scene or if she ever got into the character which she must have done albeit in very confused way questioned the actions of her heroine it turns into melodrama often of macbethian and hamlet proportions and so much of the fight action takes place in dark and dim settings you can see what going on saves on fight arrangers guess or perhaps the editor is just trying to earn his however the theme music by sean callery is an absolute tour de force don bother watching the series but do listen to the theme on youtube at the risk of upsetting few of the reviewers who think this is anti superhero gold the only possible reason for high ratings is no knowledge of what been done before and mainly total lack of any kind of critical facility their suspension of disbelief must be so great that they have no belief to suspend oh heck looks like they re making second series only hope they get better team of writers but m not going to be watching it to find out ', ' binge watched all the three seasons of daredevil and completed the entire show in just 2 days now you may ask but how did you finish it in 2 days each season has 13 episodes each being at least 1 hour long so you needed around 40 hours to watch it and considering you have to sleep for 8 hours that exactly 40 hours to which reply that right didn even eat or drink or sleep to watch it just kidding watched it at 1 5x speed whenever the talking scenes used to come but either way the point remains that finished it in couple of sittings because liked it so much as kid had played the 2000 spider man game there was brief cutscene where daredevil was shown so that was literally all knew about daredevil there was nothing else that knew about him so anything that this show showed me about daredevil completely trusted it with blind eye often this is very bad way of learning about any comicbook adaptation since many times they make bad adaptation like ghost rider or fant4stic and we are left with no choice but to accept it but this one is absolutely sick we are introduced to matt murdock blind lawyer who has trained himself into being crime fighter and he uses his skills to fight criminals but unlike regular superheroes he doesn have superhero costume yet he is only covering his face so that no one sees him in the end of the 2nd episode of season 1 we are shown how he single handedly fights an entire building of bad guys to save child it one of the most realistic looking fight scenes from any superhero tv show and charlie cox plays his role so well you can actually feel he blind in the end of season 1 he finally gets his costume he fights kingpin and gets him sent to jail now the reason why season 2 wasn all that good although was hoping it to be better than season 1 since now he had costume and allies was because now the shared universe began to get built shows like punisher iron fist luke cage and jessica jones had to be introduced because of which daredevil content started falling now he was more into elektra and punisher instead of doing what he always did his bestie began hating him for hiding his identity his girl left him but overall it wasn a bad season it just wasn as good as the previous one then in season 3 it came back to its mark now that defenders was over we could focus back on the titular hero and this time he completely annihilates kingpin this series had the best conclusion it a good thing they knew exactly where to stop and even after 7 years it has aged so well although it nowhere in my top 5 favourite superhero shows anymore shall forever remember it to be the superhero show that changed all superhero shows ', ' boring literally was checking my watch to see how much longer had to wait before it was over ', ' enjoyed this movie it not on the level of something like guardians of the galaxy but nevertheless it was pretty decent bit of escapist fun brie was little underwhelming at times and maybe wasn the best person to don superhero suit however her supporting cast largely made up for this and as with all marvel movies it looked beautiful and moved along at fair pace think lot of people gave this one star because they are easily swayed and brainwashed by other people political ideologies stop voting other people political views it reveals you to be the sheep you re trying way too hard to prove that you re not start thinking for yourself and making your own choices you know who you are ', ' was worried this series would be more teen centric but it definetely worked for this 38 year old again perfect casting with iman vellani being the best ms marvel cant imagine anyone else doing better job really appreciated the series is more ethnic focused and really loved adding the historical aspect into the series this show was not only very entertaining but added historical events that wasn aware of cant wait to see season 2 ', ' really wanted to like this series but it not produced with the same care of the other marvel titles understand that it geared more towards children but kids love the avengers so there is no reason that they had to do away with smart dialog and believable stunts ', ' really wanted to love this show loved daredevil and some netflix originals house of cards bloodline narcos marco polo but this jessica jones series after finishing the first 6 episodes is just boring it retarded might have liked this how if were mentally retarded then every stupid thing that happens in this show would make sense wasn expecting lot of actions but the action scenes here are just stupid and lame the character development is also lame couldn care any less for any of the characters especially the villain killgrave it no fun to me when the main antagonist villain is 100 evil no emotions no excitement imo would much prefer to feel something for the villain but just hated this killgrave character 100 also hated the main protagonist jessica jones her character is 100 pathetic boring inconsistent retarded trashy man really wanted to like this series can even think of single character in this series that like really banal show 100 clich not worth the time am just so disappointed hopefully daredevil season 2 will still be awesome same thing with the punisher unfortunately jessica jones will probably be back since the ratings are high edit am now watching season 02 of daredevil wow dd season 2 starts off on warp speed from the first second and never lets up and that just from watching 2 episodes have feeling every episode will end on mega cliffhanger hopefully except episode 13 the pace seems relentless when you have the punisher daredevil still cannot believe dd is the same universe as jessica jones jj dd seems to be on whole different galaxy compared to jj really hope netflix will keep dd 100 separate from jj luke cage lc please do not merge jj lc characters with dd just do dd punisher edit 04 07 16 okay forced myself to finish watching the entire season of jj s01 was hoping somehow they could turn things around this is my final conclusion jessica jones is unequivocally one of the worst tv series of all times period ', ' giving 3 stars only because of the vfx that it has vfx was the best so far as compared to all the other marvel shows when it comes to storyline its complete disaster if you have story that doesn have good ending the efforts are all in vain was hoping for better ending and was waiting for another episode but realised all the 6 episodes are over and that the end of the season ', ' wanted this movie to be good but it just wasn i ve been marvel fan since the 1970s and ve seen all their movies like 5 times each you know what this movie was it was captain america winter soldier except with chicks captain america replaced by black widow bucky replaced by black widow sister yelena that it the end the parallel in the movie make you wanna gag on top of all that there really isn any good action until around 1 hour and 45 min into the movie and the movie is 2 hours and 15 min long so do the math the rest of the time is spent with back story of how black widow had it hard growing up bad parents blah blah blah yawn wanted to like it did just wasn good 5 stars is generous ', ' black widow is new superhero movie in the marvel film series the film is directed by cate shortland the director of lore and berlin syndrome in the film natasha romanoff scarlett johansson is on the run from the government after violating the sokovia accord she goes into hiding in areas where she has lived in her past and is trained to be super spy black widow by visiting these places she is confronted by her past and encounters old acquaintances she crosses paths with yelena belova florence pugh who also completed the black widow training together they try to stop the organization behind the black widow training sessions but to do so must face spies of their level and the mysterious taskmaster this film was cate shortland first directing work of major action film she had even rejected the film as director at first but scarlett johansson managed to persuade her to direct the film anyway the fact that this is her first directing work of an action film is unfortunately reflected in the quality of the film despite the fact that most of the action scenes are entertaining they also come across bit too moving and bit juxtaposed the last action scenes also clearly show that the actors are standing in front of green screen and that the explosions like many other explosions in the film have been placed in the film with cgi the story of the film also comes across as standard spy movie but here at slow pace in the story unfortunately they also choose to overshadow the drama moments with comedy this also makes the film lose its depth the film also has some nice links for the fans with other marvel films but at one point also chooses to copy other marvel films so that moments can come across as familiar to marvel fans the acting is fortunately well done by the film cast this is scarlett johansson ninth time playing the black widow character in the marvel film series despite her character playing the lead role in this movie she plays the role better in most other marvel movies florence pugh is best portrayed in the film together with scarlett johansson they create nice mutual chemistry which comes across as the love hate relationship between two sisters viewers who have siblings of their own can relate to some of the moments the two bring out together in the film david harbor provides most of the comedic moments in the film but does not get much else to do in the film rachel weisz also has small role in the film which only helps the story move forward ', ' overall pretty boring movie the beginning was great and what had me give it as many stars as did however it then drags on with boring action and poor comedy the biggest downfall of the movie is the same as lots of other super hero movie bad villain ', ' this is pretty much on par with every other marvel product out there juvenile shallow mildly entertaining at the lowest common denominator of entertainment adequately executed m having complete blast reading the reviews labeling this as childish or aimed at younger crowd as if all of the other marvel products aren childish and aimed at the younger crowd people complaining that it woke and other such nonsense are right winged nutjobs who shouldn be allowed anywhere near any kind of entertainment product because they obviously lack the intellectual tools to understand even the most childish of concepts if anything it nice to see that after 14 years marvel somehow realized there are other kind of people on this planet rather than just white males and please don start with but black panther falcon cpt marvel black widow because those are literally two black guys and two white women out of more than dozen white male heroes so that something very little and very late but something everything else is just fine good lead actress decent performances average technical compartment vfx editing camera work and so on nice to good music and sound fx corny writing uplifting message nothing terrible and nothing to write home about ', ' boring drawn out uninteresting stupid illogical and hacky now such combination is difficult to achieve in modern big budget blockbusters including in the marvel cinematic universe they as rule convey their entertainment purpose to the viewer and wouldn say word about elementary logic and the laws of physics if we were talking about another superhero with superpowers la cap who is really able to fall from great height and grab the railing without dislocating his limb but when an ordinary person does it which is black widow it doesn seem funny to me it disappoints me an entertainment product is necessary thing but it should also have at least basic logic after watching it it seemed that marvel owed someone and finally paid off the debt without involvement without enthusiasm reluctantly it like plugging hole in product line to fulfill plan nothing more ', ' this film felt like filler movie to just create some potential future storylines am the exact type of fan that marvel studios loves because go to every single movie often 2 3 times per film subscribe to all platforms and spend money on all of it as fan would typically rate any marvel film higher on imdb because want to see marvel and the films succeed but this one rated 4 probably should have rated it 3 if you went to see this movie and haven kept up with all of the movies and disney plus series you will be scratching your head wondering what is going on the marvels is cringey in every possible way the only part enjoyed was the post credit scene marvel please do better as fan look forward to the blockbuster films and they have progressively gotten worse over the past 2 years wanted to love this movie and truly was let down ', ' what with these series marvel is doing every serie they have done so far is following the same weak writing directing and acting for real the first 40 min will have you eager to skip channels or turn it of it really is mind blowing that they then spread the mind numingness over the next weeks stead of dropping the whole season at the launch this had so much potential with the casting of the lead but like the whole show she severely disappoints ', ' absolutely fun charming watch the family dynamics remind me so much of my friend family growing up as someone who also disappears into my head lot relate to kamala even as an adult the first episode was great watch and can wait for the rest didn know what to expect but really loved it all the haters need to give it shot ', ' totally sucks ll waiting for this very long time and it coming with bomb really clueless no story no sense just bunch of garbage character ', ' oh my god too clich what are we watching cinderella it like rigging fairy tale looks like disney has started to show it effect on mcu it has pretty much similar plot to disney intertwined tv series 2021 mcu is supposed to mysterious suspenseful and with some cool action sequences but this is just some stupid drama they are trying to make it girly like old fashioned girl that people have in their minds expected wild characters like gamora black widow etc ', ' daredevil season 1 is about matt murdock blind lawyer but at night he fights crime with his other senses when first heard netflix was doing marvel show thought it could go very bad or very good and m glad to say it went fantastic everything that happened in daredevil was so prefect from the acting to the action scenes first the acting was amazing by everyone first look at charlie cox matt murdock he doesn seem like good fit for the role but he plays the role so great not single character was bad while he was great it was his antagonist wilson fisk played vincent onofrio who knocked it out of the park he is marvel best villain yet he actually real threat to our hero now the action every single action scene was done you perfect it reminds me of the movie the raid overall daredevil season 1 was perfect not single bad character or bad episode if you haven started this show you should definitely start it there also lots of easter eggs to the marvel movies ', ' mar is superheroes movie featuring captain marvel with two additional heroines this review won reveal any plot details the bad where to start first off mar is pure fan exploitation as labeled and licensed by marvel and disney the story is senseless tasteless and out of any marvel universe order the movie main characters are enforced upon the viewer and seem so out of place it a chaotic and broken script plus movie is stuffed with bad cgi acting is below mediocre at its best the good unfortunately good is not present within mar conclusion the disney and marvel movie campaign fails not worth your time ', ' change could be good but this this is just not typical marvel stuff this is drama familiy type of thing boring teenagers vs familiy traditians just not my cup of coffee and not what was expecting ', ' it a pretty good show for tv hope the writers will begin to develop the characters some say it needs more fighting to that say there already is enough of that on tv if that is what you want its not hard to find the fact that do not having knowledge of the avengers story line did not detract from my enjoyment it made me interested in catching up on all the super hero stuff that have not taken the time to watch just hope that it will not get canceled like so many other shows have chosen to watch do it has the potential to become favorite and after the first episode would be willing to bring my grandson 11 years old and totally into super hero stuff over to watch it with me good show will continue watching it ', ' in the midst of this politically correct sea of mimimis here is serious for all this in the drain the punisher follows the plot as should be did not make him gay did not blacken him say that he is poor and much less put good sense in his head or anyway it dick all season no regrets the role of punisher fell like glove for jon bernthal he gives life to character with mastery hope this continues and that netflix does not fall into the trap of wanting to please 2 of its subscribers and ends missing out on everything else ', ' amazing movie lot of action and so good fight performance emocional and funny too go watch black widow folks ', ' this was really disappointment taskmaster was lame villain and it was way too talky after waiting two years it clear that the trailer had the best parts the acting was good but the jokes fell flat and there wasn nearly enough action marvel really did black widow one of my favorite characters in their cinematic universe double disservice first they killed her off in avengers endgame movie felt was too long and in parts too dull and now this which really had almost too many characters in it could have been much better ', ' m writing the review as the movie is about to wrap up while in the theater it fairly empty so no one cares how did they even put this out they have to give you an early recap of ms marvel disney show because apparently no one watched it and would even understand her character the entire premise of this between the motivations of the big bad to the power swaps is preposterous this seems as if it a sequel to some movie that doesn exist brie larson plays the role like an i trying to portray emotions she found way to be less enjoyable in this follow up than captain marvel monica rambo hero name be it quasar or photon most likely still hasn officially been named the actress that plays ms marvel is likeable but more suited for television as opposed to big budget movies like this there are times the action sequences start off okay just to he derailed by slapped on poor effect or strange directorial choice this movie may be worse than the abomination that was the eternals and may be the nail in the coffin for disney marvel 1 star over minimum for few cool special effects and the ms marvel actress seeming to enjoy playing her character ', ' din knew marvel started making drama series never knew marvel could be tht boring ths is some low writing 150 words for ths is boring as well ', ' it called black widow but the name is not enough the story does not fit the character scarlet has great presence in every scene she in the movie is missed opportunity imo not only is the movie 6 years late in the mcu but black widow is not superhero in the same sense as captain america ', ' expected lot more from movie with such high ratings first of all right from the first scene did not understand what was going on also this movie had way way too much talk and couldn even understand or hear what they were saying almost yelled at the movie screen for them to speak clearly all these random things started happening and began to lose track of the storyline as result fell asleep the first movie have ever fallen asleep during and it was the avengers when woke up it was the last fighting scene the same thing seemed to keep happening over and over again so it wasn really that exciting the only thing got out of that movie was some of hulk jokes which were pretty funny and iron man makes you laugh too sometimes other than that it was only ok maybe it just that don like super heroes that much but did expect lot more ', ' m muslim finally they made marvel movie with islamic touch m very humbled they even managed to squeeze in words like haram halal salamualekom the truth about our dumb dads who still buy newspapers and the conservative mom who doesn trust all those infidel boys out there now my friends can see how we truly are khalalalalala ', ' this movie is so rewatchable even to this day watching all of the avengers talk and interact with each other is so much fun loki was very memorable and compelling villain he posed serious threat and he implemented some sort of urgency the recasting of the hulk wasn annoying at all the core of the relationship and argument between tony and steve has its foundation in this very film and only for that it deserves lot of recognition the only complains possible are the aging visual effects at the time they were almost revolutionary but now it aged little ', ' my faith in the qc apparatus at the marvel studio headquarters has been shaken the script was lazy the tone was glib and the stewardship of continuity was ostensibly mishandled lazy filmmaking on display would ve thought the mcu had learned what not to do from thor dark world apparently not ', ' with each subtle hint at future collaborative effort of various marvel superheroes it seems now that the entire world anticipation was growing to an immense level now that the avengers has shattered various box office records and is on pace to top the 1 billion worldwide gross mark m sure anyone bothering to write up review is doing so simply to state his or her case for how they enjoyed it not so much to tell others what to expect as far as that goes was incredibly impressed with the avengers my initial expectation of an action packed sfx laced adrenaline rush were met with ease and nothing less would have been satisfactory for any decent superhero picture also expected movie with hefty dose of comedic relief mainly because of robert downey lighthearted take on iron man in both of his solo pictures this also turned out to be true and added just what the film needed in between extremely heavy scenes of fast paced chaotic action one of the strong dividing lines throughout recent years has been the casting choices for the various superheroes that have gotten both their own pictures and inclusion in the avenger initiative going all the way back to the newer incarnations of the hulk fans were unable to come to any semblance of conclusion on who would be best for what and why why chris evans as captain america is commonly heard question as is why didn edward norton come back as the hulk unfortunately you cannot please everyone with so many pivotal casting decisions but tend to feel that overall the characters portrayed in the avengers are properly matched up to capable actors mark ruffalo does an excellent job as the mild mannered bruce banner jeremy renner and scarlet johansson are easily up to their respective characters hawkeye and black widow the rest of the team has experience in their roles from downey iron man and evans captain america to chris hemsworth thor and samuel jackson as nick fury but when combined on screen you cannot tell the rookies from the veterans simply put the avengers is the best superhero movie you re likely to come across in terms of sheer entertainment while personally wouldn rank it as my favorite reservation still hold for watchmen it without doubt worth the price of admission and the incredible amount of hype it received an incredible feat of film production and merging talents the avengers is destined to be remembered as high water mark in superhero cinema ', ' movie is slow paced and artificially filled with cgi it so predictable that even 10 year can tell you full story midway iam pretty surprised with marvel that they created this movie feel bad for scarlet and entire cast they have wasted such good characters action sequence are very flat and full of cgi ', ' dont care if m the target audience or not 60 year old white jewish male love marvel movies and tv shows the vast majority are better than 99 of what else is out there the only things that come close to the mcu are the boys umbrella academy doom patrol peacemaker stranger things and handful of other shows ms marvel is delighful show and solid entry into the mcu m looking forward to the rest of the series and ultimately seeing it integrate with the marvels movie later this year ', ' this is solid cgi action flick from marvel it what they re known for and what they produced long before infinity war and endgame just as entertaining as black panther and not as boring as homecoming though just as illogical it more more light hearted film with music synced fight sequences lots of girl power nick fury alien cats and worm holes this film has three weak points the villain is the first and lesser of the two the potential is there they justed needed something more to make it kick more dramatic moment in the end maybe with clear implications of her decision making the second point is that this is part of the larger marvel universe if you have not seen certain other movies or series parts of the first half of the movie won make total sense the makers did have the sense to eventually add explanations in the dialogue so you will get most of the picture this weak point is honestly criticism of lot of marvel movies the third is that the explanations for why marvel wasn around for so long is weak it okayyyyyy and if you can stomach the inconsistencies and stretches in the like of civil war and spiderman homecoming this really shouldn be an issue basically watch this for the fun of watching light hearted action flick with cgi and cats ', ' to take 5 months 10 dec 8 april to play the last half 8 ep of this shows first season is slap in the face to the viewers who would like to see the end before they die we live in the 21st century where media is available at our whim and binging on series is the norm waiting for an episode to come out every week is hard enough let alone the spotty drip feed that they have been serving up the show itself is definitely not up to joss whedon normally very high standards of performance it started bit low and has only gone down with the wait for the later episodes draining me of any real desire to continue watching it to the end ', ' m going to start off by saying didn think was going to watch ms marvel originally based on the trailers had thought damn this one just isn for me loved kamala story in the avengers game and always felt confused why they couldn replicate something like that for having much less budget than shows like moon knight loki wandavision etc thought ms marvel did great job with the action and character of kamala the underlying story of this show is actually excellent the djinn partition and kamala teen roots had potential to tell really compelling story but as with previous disney shows it just simply lacked the episode count to fulfill this it definitely deserves season 2 surprisingly great character was bruno who oozed peter parker vibes as m aware the actor was in the final running for that role my only problems with the show come with certain characters and really it all comes down to the runtime they were given to tell their story the clandestine villains were quite boring as they didn get ton of screen time to flush out their motivations and kamala moms inconsistent treatment of her daughter made that storyline hard to come to terms with but in the end it didn bother me ton kamrans final evil moment was weird lol but think it proved to me more that was really enjoying kamala character can believe that m saying this but kamala khan has single handedly intruigued me into looking forward to captain marvel 2 which should be testament enough that this show was pretty good ', ' dont know whats up with all the negative trash people are throwing at it but for an average marvel fan like me this movie had everything was looking for brie larson is refreshingly cool and captain marvel is an absolute powerhouse ', ' heard about the bad reviews before seeing captain marvel but figured from all the reviews saying it people slayting on it cause she a women which didn make sense as this isn the first movie we ve had women in the lead role and as superhero eg wonder women alita and ghost in shell to name few went in there with the mind set it may not be great but good enough well me my wife and sister all thought the same this is rubbish the whole time was waiting to get pulled into the story and get excited to see her use her powers and fly but you sort of see her powers straight away minus the flying and when you do see it it nothing like wow moment you find out how she gets her powers near the middle end so most of the film your just wondering how she got them and when you find out your like oh right ok was that it just felt like it had lots missing to it didnt really care much about her was never really woried or felt much toward her like did for wonder women or any of the avengers think the actress who played captain marvel was very woden and not very good actress scarlet johanson played her part really well in the avengers so hopefully she can get some tips of her was just really disappointed that this is the hero who supposed to save the day in endgame thought her powers were not amazing and felt like when she used them they didn really do much unless your juxbox or door tbh if your seeing this to the up to endgame you don need to has nothing in it that ties to endgame apart from the credit scene which you can get on youtube and tbh it wasn all that if you wondering how fury gets the pager little spoiler she gives it to him after he hands it to her earlier in the film but this time she modified it to call her overall d say it reminded me of netflix marvel show d say it was watchable but nothing more annoyed at myself for sticking up for it before saw it and now actually want my money back ', ' m happy because this show is related with pakistan and my religion ve watched first episode and m waiting for other hope this show will be successful love you ms marvel from pakistan ', ' plot kamala superhero fan with an imagination particularly when it comes to captain marvel feels like she doesn fit in at school and sometimes even at home that is until she gets superpowers like the heroes she admires cast unusually not familiar with anyone involved however iman vellani is excellent which is further impressive when you remember this is her first role verdict remember when word got out that ms marvel was happening there was lot of unpleasantness remember when the trailer dropped there was even more but this time for different reasons however went in with an open mind and experienced quite the surprise vellani knocks it out of the park as the titular hero in what most consider tamer more light hearted marvel outing but is it different marvel characters different tones some lighter and some darker so why emphasize the lighter tone here is it aimed at kids no no more than guardians of the galaxy or antman not everything needs to be gritty not everything needs to have dark undertones if that what you want go watch the tatters that is the dc universe her powers that complaint is valid and frustrating the mcu has taken liberties with characters before look at the mandarin look at taskmaster and though it into the men extended universe look at the original outing of deadpool in the wolverine movie yikes so yes this isn the ms marvel you re used to in the comics and that don like but got over it so you can as well ms marvel is silly fun wholesome and oddly endearing tale that left me wanting more but also appreciating it simply wasn needed this was an origin story an introduction and nothing more bravo enjoyed it rants it poorly written they bark to disguise the real reasons weird when you look at the similarities between all these allegedly poorly written movies and shows it almost as if it not about the wring at all all the things in the world to get upset about to be passionate about to spew vitriol about and this is what you choose no wonder the world is such tribalistic mess the good iman vellani lot of fun really charming the bad the changes to the character ', ' this show is obejctively awful can only draw the conclusion that it was made solely for the demographic of people with attention spans so low they are incapable of watching anything for more than 2 minutes without subway surfers footage being overlayed somewhere on the screen 1 no script insufferable characters these are the same point because there evidently was no script written or proof read for this show every character rambles on about absolutely nothing every single second of screen time in an attempt to mask the fact there is no script have never seen such blatant example of people talking without saying anything you could use text to speech program mash your keyboard and then click to have the computer read out the incoherent string of characters you typed and that would be indistinguishable from the verbal diarrhoea that dominates this show nevermind concepts like character development or world building this show doesn even have characters just bland templates spouting inane meaningless strings of words to fill the evident void left behind by the lack of any script story characters personality etc also on the subject of the script it is beyond moronic that japanese characters communicate almost exclusively in yank idioms we have elderly japanese politicians trying to talk about serious subjects to sway votes and for some reason their dialect is the same as mentally impaired 14 year old yanks whose dictionary is limited to rizz skibidi and based 2 zero budget animation the art style makes every character look like they were drawn in paint the animation runs at less than 10fps and has less detail less fluid movement than early 2000 flash games ', ' take 5 parts average super hero stuff find group of poorly trained actors and sprinkle sham excuse for script togther shake bake and voila right up there with 4400 remake what an epic failure to capitalize on an excellent movie some productions should never see the light of day this is clearly one of them ', ' think it a classic and ll come back to it later love the avengers ', ' first season is absolutely good best fight sequence storyline second season is not good as first one there are couple of fight scenes in this season didn get the purpose of second season ', ' hey disney remember your place is to entertain us not to tell us how to think even if you re right don care it not your job you forgot your place ', ' well decided to go to the theather bad call it has been while since am hoping for the movie to end so much nonsense and boring conversations very slow pace ', ' halfway through everything was alright the movie was enjoyable and the plot was unfolding nicely but after that the rest of it was forced cgi for the sake of having spectactular combat scenes and all that yes for the vfx the movie is great they did more than decent job but the rest was eh let say it a good to watch once but just once movie why is it that vast majority of films of which the executive producer is also the main character fail to impress miserably ', ' ms marvel story line is extraordinary it is completely different than other mcu place like uk usa etc all chrectors are performing too good waiting for movie of kamala ', ' 5 haven seen many superhero movies in recent memory hard to keep up with marvel or dc flick coming out with the rhythm of one every month and half so m honestly getting pretty annoyed with this genre the avengers was one of the first to begin this endless stream and probably the first ensemble of superheroes to come out verdict not good at all most of the characters are full of themselves and unbearable to watch in all their unpleasantness others are just useless ragdolls ve never felt even the slightest sign of danger or distress and the funny parts weren that funny the movie is just big moving toy with no personality whatsoever ', ' enjoyed captain marvel lot gave it an 8 10 because it was different and 90s based the marvels was more of the lackluster streak mcu has been on sadly did not care for the two sidekicks monica and kamala because they acted like children and captain marvel was babysitting them the kree and hala people were just there nick fury is shell of the his original character years ago captain marvel lost her guts and is now bleh and somehow with little motivation to kick butt the story was non existent much like the recent marvel movies did not understand what the heck was the plot not familiar with the writer or director of this movie but hope they don do any more marvel content ', ' not sure why the studio think it is good idea to pair an arrogant woman with her idol and someone from the past they were almost zero chemistry among the three main casts indian mother telling jokes that barely hit don think have ever heard joke so dry that almost no one laughing in the theater people watching this move with total confusion and seriousness get that once in while marvel has to bet on some kind of weird idea after all it was how all these started from just an iron man movie but this is quite embarrassing the marvels is movie that is so unrelatable that it would take so much time and effort for anyone to process the story if there even any story ', ' fresh take on an mcu show with big heart big spiderman homecoming vibes with an original and delightful lead and supporting cast can wait to find out the real story of her powers ', ' this recent superhero film pleasantly surprised me with its engaging content throughout unlike other lengthy films in its franchise this one struck perfect balance in duration the dynamic trio at the center of the story showcased exceptional chemistry both when together and individually their scenes packed with exhilarating action including body switching sequences were impressively executed the film excelled in blending humor fun and fast paced action its straightforward narrative is appreciable and accessible even for those not deeply familiar with the franchise previous installments notable highlight was the portrayal of the youthful protagonist kamala whose vibrancy and energy along with her family depiction added fresh dimension to the story the adorable cats featured in the film also added charming touch furthermore the end credits scene was particularly thrilling setting an exciting tone for future developments in the series ', ' could not get into it the movie was ok but not great her acting kinda sucks in this movie she need better acting coach or something did not feel this movie at all taskmaster could have been better as well this movie should have been for free from start the soundtrack was good though lol would not recommend this movie as great but as something to let the little girls watch when they are acting bad and and you need them to get quiet at home boring boring boring ', ' probably the most important blockbuster of the 21st century so far this generation star wars 1977 cultural landmark that proved individual stories serving unifying purpose can be told within cinematic universe feat that many studios have tried to replicate but failed and something that the mcu struggles with today the biggest challenge that the avengers 2012 would face is having to balance the immense stardom that comes with the previous five films which all lead up to this moment moment that would make or break the marvel cinematic universe the moment when six individual and leading multi layered superhero characters would share the silver screen together for the first time what makes this film work so well is joss whedon screenplay highlight of the film that respects and values each character their motivations and their overall arcs even all the jokes iconic lines and quips feel organic and true to each persona the lab scene where all the main characters present argue and clash over different things beautifully captures the perfect synergy between the different characters it my favourite scene in the film and probably the most well written one in the mcu which establishes so much in so little time from technical aspect the visual effects are still as remarkable as they were ten years ago when first saw the film hulk design is drastically improved from his stand alone feature and is my favourite incarnation of the character in the mcu stark suits always look incredible and it a shame that in infinity war and endgame they are less practical and just worse captain america suit is goofy as hell and overall the other visuals or designs do not stand out but the film does choose to take safe bright well light approach to its cinematography and aesthetic instead of specific look there nothing don like about the film and there undoubtedly lot of nostalgia packed into it at this point but it always feels fresh and exciting whenever see any scene the one shot during the battle of new york is one of the most glorious comic book film moments ever you just can not have fun with this film ', ' firstly m not at all familiar with the comic know they changed her powers and bla bla bla first episode started off decent with nice scott pilgrim vibe if it had stayed like that it could have been fun watch but it just went downhill from there on and by the looks of it it not picking itself up again lead actress does good job though especially considering what she given which is nothing ', ' this is by far the worst thing marvel has put out to date including the original howard the duck some of the visuals were pretty cool deff copied into the spider verse with some of the graphics but everything else was hot garbage the costumes look like they came from thrift store the main chicks acting will make you cringe at least 3 times an episode found myself annoyed with her by the end of every episode as well oh and she has giant crush on her cousin this show has put dent in the mcu id rather watch eternals 100 times in row than sit through this torture again ', ' from the beginning in the movie the avengers there is an ongoing battle between an agency called h e d and the evil loki after taking staff with an unlimited amount of power called the tesseract loki planed on opening portal to allow aliens to invade earth but the team h e d had other plans and launched project avengers recruiting the marvel super heroes of earth iron man k tony starks the incredible hulk k dr bruce banner thor k god of lightning captain america k steve rodgers hawkeye k clinton barton and black widow k natalia romanova to stop loki and his alien army from taking over earth and possibly destroying it was impressed in how well they did in bringing all the characters together and connecting their story lines one way or another good example of how some the characters story line connected in the avengers is tony starks k iron man dad was great scientist inventor he was the genius that was able to turn steve rodgers into captain america and giving him his powers by experimenting on him making him into great success tony knew very well about captain america because of his dad telling stories about him years on down the road scientist tried to recreate the experiment on bruce banner that was done to steve rodgers and gave him his powers but it went wrong causing him to change in to the incredible hulk when he gets angry thor dad basically adopted loki when he was baby making loki thor brothers thor was chosen by his dad to be the god of lightning and the protector of earth where all the avengers live all the characters had their own individual story line but somewhere in the line they connected to each other some more than others the reason the avengers were brought together was because loki came through portal in to the base of h e d to take the powerful tesseract so they made it their mission to recruit the avengers to stop him from continuing with his plan it wasn easy convincing them but they all had their own motives as to why the thought they should help save the world they had been keeping up with all the heroes without them know in case of global emergency like this bruce asked black widow how did you find me and she responded we never lost you we have been keeping up with you he was not real easy to convince to help but they really need him on their team iron man was not very hard to find but he found his own reasons to team up with the avengers and save the world after missing out on the first war he fought in captain america did want to miss out on this battle so he was ready to fight with the team thor saw the evil his brother loki was causing and decided to join the avengers in battle against him that is how the avengers got brought together after having their story lines cross before all the characters got together to become the avengers they all had their own movie telling their own story line as to how they got their powers and got where they were all their story lines crossed each other at some point some more than others but at the end they all got brought together by team h e d the epic battle of having to stop the evil loki and his alien army from taking over earth is what brought all the heroes together at the end of it all even though some of the stories were connecting more than others they all got connected by the battle equally with each character having their own role the connection between the characters was well plotted out in this movie ', ' so many of you are giving this movie rating of 1 10 seriously if you rate this movie 1 10 then how would you rate movies such as disaster movie or slenderman you are supposed to give an honest rating didn like it 4 10 it was awful in almost every way possible 1 10 mcu movies are harmless fun with wonderful actors ok storylines and top notch production had fun watching this movie as well you really shouldn take these movies too damn seriously awesome popcorn flicks ', ' the punisher is marvel univers character an unpowered guy with guns among heroes without that distinctive factor he is just another angry guy with gun like it as been done thousands of times had hope with this series following marvel crossover that they would have understood this most basic fact the core of the character yet its just another adpatation of some guy with skull shirt shooting things the pubisher the real one the fun one that rivals spiderman and daredevil as yet to be done ', ' all the hipe for nothing this is by far worst project from marvel ', ' this movie is mere shadow compared to other movies in the marvel universe the story is weak you re never led to care for anyone or anything that happens everything new we learn about black widow can basically be gleaned from the trailer or synopsis the cgi is really rough acting is average not worth your time ', ' bw is not one of my favourites from marvel however was surprised would say that florence pugh and david harbour have the standout parts and carry the film better than the main character with that said it a thumbs up ', ' never thought that this show will be this good it is literally one of the best shows ve ever watched recommend it and might not like it in the beginning but just give it bit of time ', ' think this is the point where marvel is going to stop costing off of its successful properties there is comics that sold better than ms marvel that fans would love to see almost unwatchable low quality it like m watching straight to dvd bruce willis movie ', ' once marvel got there hands on the punisher they can finally do the anti hero some justice after the terrible past movies of the punisher marvel done what the beloved character needed ', ' let me just say how funny find it that almost everyone in this show is top notch martial artist it every generic action movie spaced out into episodes and seasons it has plenty clich but it also has some bit of story somewhere within it wilson fisk though is terrible terrible character first off no one talks like that his overall behaviour and demeanour is supposed to add to the character but it actually takes from it scriptwriters need to stop this nonsense mob bosses and criminals are not robots they re people still another impressive thing is the pacing it fantastic for show about vigilante and an alter ego it moves very fast thought it would take time to paint picture and all that but true to the action movie status everything happens right now expectations are subverted not over period but in the moment things happen in the second episode you think are meant for the second last and it keeps rolling forward either way never slows down never loses lustre very impressive pathetic characters pathetic characterization that probably this show biggest weakness also they don have compelling narrative really the action choreography is hit and miss the plot which is inferior by the way doesn unfold it just fed to you the dialogue is hit and miss there plenty of hits and misses in this show the hits are really great but the misses take sooo much away from it also this is not cartoon man covering the top half of his face and people don recognize him the earlier episodes were good after about six there no flavour anymore or maybe just couldn turn blind eye anymore it just going around in circles it hits wall and never gets back up ', ' matt certainly isn a lawyer there no even single case he successfully deals with in the court he isn a true vigilante or hero either he starts panting sighing on the floor after ten secs of beating or getting beaten by someone also fisk gets arrested twice in daredevil what guarantees that he would be punished second time waste of time indeed ', ' this is the biggest mess to this modern movie experiences for the entire length of the film it was disorientated mess without any depth of story telling brie larsen was dull and flat while other supporting actors were just pure bad the story had no flow and kept the audiences disconnected ms marvel is stupid character with no purpose or value captain is better in the acting department but her character is under values the entire marvel universe has become money gather piggy bank that really does not provide any entertainment and really just goes about wasting the item of audiences ', ' watches as in viewings not the kind christopher walken sticks up his bum first watched avengers 1 while back having not seen any of the individual movies rated it meh 5 10 having no real connection to the characters or wider story arcs meant was reliant on the spectacle which without those anchors felt little vapid that on me recently got meta quest 3 and have been blown away by 3d movies within that headset the ridiculously large viewing screen fills the entire field of view and is surprisingly comfortably so 3d depth is considerable at that size and the isolation of the headset means you re all in the movie immersive highly enjoyable experiences with the likes of mad max fury road dune jungle book and guardians of the galaxy persuaded me to go through all the mcu infinity saga so up to the end of phase 3 plus guardians iii also buy frenzy on ebay amazon means now have the 3d blurays first 5 marvel flicks were mostly ok to good but nothing really great while the criticism against modern cgi blockbusters is often valid prioritising spectacle franchise recognisability over story telling what makes the marvel movies so successful is the strength of their scripts and cast this has been really apparent in my second watch of the first avengers movie which is the first of the infinity saga to bag strong 8 10 score big improvement from the 5 10 d given it previously the reason for the big jump is less the vr headset and more the viewer familiarity of the characters anyone who curious about these movies but doesn feel like they have the time to go through them all are doing themselves and the movies disservice used to feel that way but watching the avengers without really knowing who they are is an empty experience might as well not watch them at all if you have the time or rather the motivation like me discovering fantastic new way to view movies then have to recommend you first watch the previous 5 mcu movies yes even including the painfully bad hulk one this way avengers 1 becomes well rounded experience the fun spectacle is nicely balanced with character interactions developments making the viewer feel rewarded for having previous knowledge this is crucial angle missed first time round but appreciate much better now the 3d itself is also the best so far deeper with even few notable pop outs which in the massive vr screen look great also much more enjoyed the villain loki on this second watch as this time was armed with the previous thor movie on that note the main trio of iron man cap thor were also more enjoyable to follow next stop iron man 3 it may well be more middling movie but now understand the build up is essential to the main events coming later in the saga like good musical piece it paying attention to the build up which makes the climax especially rewarding ', ' this movie was perfect for the mcu the acting was fun florence was great choice and the story was capturing enjoyed it so much watched it twice will it win an oscar no it does however fit so well into the mcu and loved it ', ' plot carol danvers becomes one of the universe most powerful heroes when earth is caught in the middle of galactic war between two alien races cast brie larson samuel jackson because duh jude just consistently dreadful law annette bening djimon hounsou clark gregg and blink and you ll miss him lee pace who returns as ronan but looks so different didn even think it was him verdict watched this back when it was initially released watched it second time few days ago as the missus is wanting us to binge watch the entire mcu as she very behind my opinion has changed on the 2nd viewing and not in good way my rating has shifted from 6 10 to 5 10 you see straight out of the gate the first thing you notice about carol danvers is she not really character you can get behind she not funny she not entertaining she comes across as surly teenage girl who is just upset at the slightest thing and just doesn want to be there this is not character you can build movie around like trying to make teenage groot movie it wouldn work but he okay as side character supporting cast are also hit and miss jackson and gregg are great but lynch and law just stink up every scene they re in m marvel fan but recognize where it weak this is distinctly average film that serves as standalone origin story and doesn contribute much to the universe as whole rants remember when the movie came out all the controversy with brie larson just had to google what the controversy even was as don remember due to not focusing on such things now can really get definitive answer from what see it a combination of people not liking her attitude and her comments on feminism so googled further to see what she said she came across arrogant in them and smidge out of touch but none of it explained the overwhelming hate ve seen aimed at her then remembered that people talk about all the different types of bigotry but misogyny rarely comes up remembered that it visibly increased over the past decade and appreciated why she been targeted news flash the outspoken loud brash man hating femnists you likely thing of when you hear that word make up very small percentage feminism is good if you disagree hope you simply don know the meaning of the word the good jackson and gregg has couple of decent moments not bad soundtrack goose the bad larson isn great law and lynch are terrible lead just comes across unlikable overall just weak entry to the mc ', ' waited couple of days to write this review because really wanted to like it don even know where to begin first off the film is called black widow this is her first and probably last considering the events in end game solo film and yet she is basically just supporting character don get me wrong florence pue did an amazing job as expected however it seemed the film cared to much on setting up for her character to take up the mental rather than focusing on black widow herself another thing hated the cheesy mind control plot line for the assassins of the red room not spoiler it revealed in the opening act and the fact that all the assassins of the red room are all called black widows so her super heroine name isn even unique they could of done what kill bill did with different names like black mamba and copper head but digress the biggest sin however of this film is taskmaster to quote the god father look how they massacred my boy if you are fan of the character you will be severely disappointed in this portrayal if you know nothing about this character than you will still probably be severely disappointed for how they cop out with the conclusion of the character they establish the second biggest sin of the film is they revel an absolutely amazing gut punch character decision through back flash but once again the film cops out and pulls it punches the only pro this film has is the family dynamic involving natasha and the supporting cast in conclusion the film advertised itself as gritty spy thriller like the newer bond films but in reality it just comes off campy and cheesy like the classic bond films minus the charm just go back and rewatch winter soldier ', ' this movie is one of the best marvel movies and maybe superhero movie ever ', ' loved it black widow is funny and action packed fun my kids love her too ', ' black widow brings mcu back in theatres after two years and it perfectly catches the spirit of marvel it a solid movie with great characters and good chemistry between them the acting is also great with florence pugh completely in the part and good scarlett johansson the action sequences are great intense and keep the viewer focused also the costumes are great natasha backstory is well built and the whole development of her character is very emotional not so frequent aspect in mcu however the movie has some flaws such as the villain as often happens in mcu it stereotyped and taskmaster is weak character nevertheless it a great marvel movie in my opinion lot better than captain marvel and black panther stand alones ', ' don see why everybody has liked this movie so much did not like this movie think its amateurish take on teaming up the super heroes to entertain the audience most of the jokes and one liners are outdated and you hardly feel like laughing at them except for few from the man the iron man the silly quarrels the team gets into turns you off the concept of getting our bad guy from out of space the powers of whose almost are like supernatural is totally unimpressive all in all would say only kids may enjoy this movie am big fan of marvel comics and thoroughly enjoyed the spidermans the iron mans etc but this one except for some action at the end is waste of time and money ', ' even tho the acting was perfect the make up and the effects were perfect as punisher fan didn like it and for good reasons the punisher we used to know from the comics the movies and the game was absolutely ruthless he had no mercy no regrets and not even one bit of hesitation he hunts evil people and enjoy it as they fear his name and run in terror at the first contact he plays with them like kid playing with his toys but not this one the punisher from this series is weak and he is almost alive at the end of every fight almost pathetic he talks too much and express his feelings too much and he experience moments of fear and hesitation too much and what makes it even worse is that the story is anti punisher whoever wrote the story doesn understand the punisher the story used to be about pure revenge in the worst way possible that it simple violent and fun now the story is attacking the punisher and every thing he represents killing is wrong torturing is wrong your murdered family doesn give you the right to kill the show turned into very boring agenda about why revenge is bad and worthless and hate it because it not fun anymore have to wait for 5 episodes to see the punisher kill someone and 3 episodes more as he feel bad about it the story is not about war and conflict between frank and his enemies anymore it about conflict between frank and the kids around him to figure out is killing bad guy is ok or not ', ' such great series my whole family loved it sure they made some changes from the comic but thats ok the same feel is there we can wait to see more awesome adventures keep them coming marvel ', ' how the mighty have fallen when marvel first introduced iron man to the big screen and gave birth to the mcu it was obvious to all us nerds that we were watching product made by people like us for us for 23 movies marvel gave us cohesive coherent fun and exciting universe that culminated in two part avengers story that had us laughing cheering and crying together in theatres sure not all the movies were great but even the bad ones added to the overall lore being built but alas like all good things in hollywood the mcu has now been co opted by corporate interests and we are now getting sub par at best drivel that is more about ticking boxes and selling disney subscriptions than it is about telling good stories which brings us to the marvels which is as bland boring and soulless as you can get from big budget superhero movie sure it looks good and the cast give it their best but nothing can paper over the cracks of what is shockingly bad script story and direction the main villain is so completely forgettable that even while watching the movie had no idea what her name was still don and at no point during the mercifully short run time were there ever any stakes when the movie descended into ridiculous disney musical around the halfway mark totally checked out this movie is horrible to the point where m not sure can take this universe seriously anymore after movies like the eternals thor love and thunder quantumania and shows like she hulk secret invasion and echo it obvious that marvel is no longer trying to produce quality products it a shame to see the death of the mcu but all good things must come to an end sadly unless someone can rescue marvel from disney there is no coming back from this mire of mediocrity ', ' its just bad and has weird pace personally im not fan ', ' so sad to say this but whoever wrote the movie has succeeded in making this big fail so confusing premise no clear storyline lack of original action or capturing events and on top of that musical seriously how would that work in comic feel the disappointment and sadness for every fan who was anticipating this movie from marvel and for leading heroine such waste of talent opportunity and viewer time do not attempt to use this movie to get someone to be marvel universe fan please watch this movie if you need to have background noise playing while you are cooking or cleaning the house or you want to create distraction to sleep ', ' gave this show try even though the trailers looked terrible thought would at least give it the benefit of the doubt and watch the first two episodes unfortunately they have been horrible first the main character kamala is just unlikable she annoying disrespectful and not interesting even when she gets her powers it just cheesy there is no reason to root for her speaking of her powers so far they are really lame it like dumb downed combination of mr fantastic and dr strange she makes big hands and sparkly steps sorry but it doesn do anything for me her homemade costume is nothing but cringe she ll probably get better costume soon but so far all we have seen is the homemade version and it is terrible every version of spider man initial suit was better than this you can tell the writers really want to make you like kamala but they make the same mistake bad stepmom does when she comes into family good stepmom will endear herself to her stepchildren by praising their mother and putting her up on pedestal she tells the kids that she could never replace their mom but she there to be companion to their father and do her best to help take care of them bad stepmom on the other hand will try to raise herself up by tearing down their mother demeaning and insulting her trust me it doesn do anything but turn those kids against her the same goes for these writers instead of building up past avengers they literally insult and demean them within the first 60 seconds of the show bad move the writing overall is just terrible it feels like they went to couple of gender studies and ethnic studies classes and pulled some of the students to have them write the scripts the woke is strong with them the dialogue is so stilted and forced that it almost vomit inducing they need to learn that no one likes to be preached to especially this woke garbage bottom line this is horrific show with nauseating writing annoying characters uninteresting plots and laughable super hero elements it not really even an mcu show at all it feels more like bad high school series that hijacks the mcu branding so that people would watch it they wouldn be getting views any other way ', ' this new superhero flick by marvel is quite good being fan of many past marvel movies feel that director joss whedon did give most comic book fans film that they will remember it is packed with action costumed superheroes villains gadgets plot twists witty dialogue much like well written comic strip however for those not entirely familiar with the heroes as well as those who are looking for more serious plot they won find anything deep in this flick it is as roger ebert put it the westminster dogshow of superheroes the production team incorporates myriads of digital visual and sonic effects to give film goers the biggest bang for their buck nevertheless children will find it very exciting as will most marvel aficionados if you are sucker for pleasing friday night flick with not too much to offer other than thrilling star studded adventure and number of humorous jests by robert downey jr this is certainly for you enjoy ', ' recently saw that this was underappreciated marvel animation they were pretty much right the script animation and plot we re all pretty on point it is short anime only about 10 episodes but definitely worth the watch hope it gets second season with no changes ', ' the good news is for the first hour and half black widow is actually little better than the abomination d expected there some competently handled if distractingly implausible action scenes the cgi is decent enough and the girl power nonsense is mostly kept to bearable levels until the very tiresome last half hour but in film with an overwhelmingly female cast every single one of them is presented as either smart and competent hero or victim there are no female villains only big bad white men every single one of whom is either arrogant and evil or stupid and useless the single exception to this rule the rather obvious diversity hire playing mason t fagbenle is easily the worst performance in the film and ray winstone terrible accent william hurt and even the taskmaster character are wasted and disastrously underused offering no real threat and hardly being onscreen at all johansson and florence pugh are both solid but they have very little of any substance to work with there no weight to any of the emotional scenes and just about all the jokes fall flat rachel weisz and david harbour as the parents are ok but their characters changing behaviours and ability to construct sentences in english make no sense the big change made to the taskmaster was disappointment as well and detracted from the character in the final analysis it not the very worst superhero film ever and certainly not as bad as captain marvel or wandavision but the last half hour falls apart very badly and the rest of it is long dull and largely underwhelming slog with nothing you haven seen many times before in better movies just done quite bit worse and in this it bodes badly for the future of marvel ', ' those are my number ratings for the three seasons loved season one despite the karen character being major player woll is not very good cox is solid and onofrio is good despised season two after the punisher storyline becomes secondary elektra yung here is an awful character and single handedly wrecks the show you grow to despise daredevil for going along with her crap but she my old girlfriend stupid not to mention all of the hand garbage and black sky setup for defenders season three is much better all around ', ' ny de niro nostalgia for hell kitchen and atmosphere that impregnated with the snow and frost the wind and the pouring rain it recalls the mysterious soft halloween in coffee houses or gotham east end or the real bronx and yellow red extravaganza fall and now rainy december in moscow and seems as if jessica jones lives with us here and now here and there not in parallel but it is in our universe goes not only inside the red brick borough of new england but also among the medieval moscow streets elegant ragged jeans bottle of expensive whiskey in her sloppy bag and she is super lady all the same it seems as she goes upstairs into the next to your an apartment somewhere on the bronnaya street or zemlyanoy val street she opens her laptop acer not any macbook or sony vaio mind you and eliminates the world evil in the same way as it can do and you yes like easy and unconstrained fashion of 2010 2015 in this film just like in 8sense or orphan black or pretty little liars now netflix is successful on this way don know as marvel like realistically show the life of new york and the hell kitchen modern no flowery hippie times or infinitely violent times of the 60 like the fact that really what does not kill you makes it more strange we live in the post epo of the banditry and in the post informality it seems all the ideals that derived to movement of humanity are ended and generation is thuggee or have suffocated in the format of their facebook or vcontakte we have already passed quantum leap into the future we notice it or not do not know but here it came here and now very good was looked the truth about troll new age that called just so now about people with psychic abilities which of course use them for power and control great find the authors of the series have been invited for the role of david tennant he plays the role of psychopaths very good as well good idea about experiments on the creation of super soldiers of how it gets out of control and causing damage to the surrounding life at least the problem posed and in art now like new yorker attitude to work they all work and lot of work considered disgrace to be idlers do not tell about us russians where all deify two things business and nightclubs like the openness of american people to each other and as usual loyalty in friendship and love for the person what love in american movies and of course like the heroine kristen ritter strong clever discreet romantic and realistic at the same time with an inner core free and so without feminism or social declarations think it is too close to the russian apolitical audience huh take my thoughts like lol we are looking for heroes but many of us want to see in them not only victory over extreme situations but also to win over every day and we must win in our usual life and in jessica personally see for myself hero the hero of our time she owns himself and his life it does not suffer from nouveau rich syndrome when the poor people start to get dressed to the nines and buy golden gadgets to show that they are no longer the poor is typical of brooklyn for immigrants from third world countries for our country she knows how to love and choose the coolest and handsome man the only one who in my opinion he deserves her and he is luke mike colter she knows how to build and maintain lifetime true friendship with trisha great game of the protagonist 2 rachael taylor and she not in all of this no one false note even weakness she plays perfectly without shadow of lie she easily outputs from the state of vegetation her friend malcolm eyck darvill and removes this needle addict from life because now we do not need in requiem for dream more nothing as aptly named man passersby because today we have little time for this games maybe in terms of the action in the series gives some other movies in which the accents in the battle scenes but heroine and show superior and many work in the movies comic books and many many books from the point of view of psychology fidelity to herself at every step in our hard life without whining tantrums and weaknesses keeping constantly dignity and elegance the ability to be myself and not only in an extreme situations in name of adrenaline but also in everyday life the big discovery for me was bit part in the performance of dr claire rosario dawson in few minutes during the care for luke in the apartment jessica she reveals her charismatic potential as actress and the potential of her character recommend to view the series for people who are looking for among the tv series hits rather than bloodshot water season the best is to spent your time on viewing the much interesting movies like this film and to read great books ', ' main character to childish and too arrogant not good example for kids nowadays being too proud and arrogant looks like by herself she could take on thanos why do we need the avengers overall it was just okay could have done better job on characterizations not the best superhero film liked wonder woman lot better ', ' started watching and 40 minutes into the movie and still can tell what going on rough combination of bad acting lousy script cheap cgi and lack of synergy between characters and actors it just doesn work seriously think ve seen movies in the early 2000s with better cgi it ended being boring movie and also cringy it was very hard to watch it miss og marvel movies this was terrible to watch and to think of all the good movies marvel used to make simulating emotion and bringing joy and excitement this was lacking of it wonder what the future of marvel hope that the marvels is not part of it ', ' who wrote the script its so shallow and cringeworthy the movie feeds into first world ignorance rather than clearing cultural misrepresentation aaaand thought latest jurassic park was worst this one takes the crown ', ' yeah sure some of the plot drops weren as emotionally hard hitting as d have liked but can tell you this was any worse than really good had smile on my face 90 of the time watching this the performance of kamala was really just brilliant and the final episodes sorta main fight sequence was pretty darn good ', ' tl dr awful plot soooo awful role playing more than that they even destroyed already existed good characters like nick fury his role here was sooo underwhelming the plot they just lost in their own ideas about parallel worlds universe and space each movie abandons previous one actors well just pain to watch do not believe at all in their emotions the whole kid like manner ugh just so hard to watch fights looks like someone was told to just do what you want films of 2000x had much better fight and action scenes for who this film honestly don know maybe for 8 10 years old children who are only interested with bright scenes without any plot without actors doing their job to express their characters definitely not for phase 1 3 marvels fans ', ' love the action crime life drama not so much cgi feel scenes so real ', ' actually watched it the day it was out enjoyed the whole movie nice storyline potent character connections it just decently fitted between previous marvel movies although nat could have been interpreted in much more depth and detail ', ' this movie was great loved seeing powerful female superhero for once that wasn gawked at for her beauty that was the reason disliked the wonder woman movie so much it was too based on how gorgeous she was instead of what bada she was thought brie larson did great job and am so excited to see what she does in end game people gripe about her banter but tony stark does the same thing and is well liked thought it added to the character in positive way and definitely had few laughs this was an origin movie and people are upset that she was unstoppable that the power they need when it comes to beating thanos m hoping this woman saves the universe captainmarvel girlpower ', ' have been fan of marvel comics and films m struggling to get through episode 3 of this show it so poorly paced get that there needs to be back story but this show so far feels like m getting 25 back story 70 teeny bopper drama and 5 action being generous forgettable characters m okay with disney integrating other cultures and religions but this show feels more about the culture than the actual superhero story unfortunately m gluten for punishment and will probably stick through it just so can have the continuity of the mcu could ve been great show with better writing and balancing of the story action ', ' this is an amazing movie the effects were great and although only went to the 2d showing id recommend this film to anyone the best part of this movie for me was the mighty thor the worst part has to be the really crappy super heroes black widow and the guy with the bow yeah he was so interesting that don even know who it was too much emphasis on those 2 as characters and not enough hulk captain america was amazing but it totally casts shadow over any fantastic 4 collaboration being believable in the future enjoyed the singular captain america movie after second watch but this movie was mind blowing dr banner my secret is m always angry amazing ', ' in two words if you want to see comedy this is fair movie if you want to see superhero movie that prepares you to avengers endgame full of suspense and action you are going to be dissapointed bad bad bad rated two only for the cgi the whole rest of it was crap ', ' the copy and paste of the character faith from the show buffy is already sin the actress is only playing one tone of emotion tormented every single frame so the more watch episode of jj the more feel depressed for every dumb choice the character make for every secondary secondary plot that we got force feed about her lawyer who is not pleasant enough to make us care about too long and the scenery is so poorly wrote start laughing so many times for incoherence what can knock off jj or even for my first stroller ex machina when pursuit is stopped because of 3 stroller blocking one of 3 passages for the hero not mentioning every single dumb choice every character seems to make all the time at least kilgrave looks to have fun he really looks act like psychopath and it great until they force feed us again with background story transforming bad ass persona into whiny boy good job ', ' amazing action good direction the acting would have been better if the dialogue was better eric pearsons screenwriting has destroyed every film that he has worked for think he must have been hired to destroy to marvel films m serious lots of people say that ', ' season one of the punisher does reasonably well presently mildly interesting scenario featuring somewhat dark but compelling main character it gets into trouble by straying too often into the realm of gore to the point where it seems the writers just wanted to gross the audience out rather than satisfy the punisher rather straightforward sense of justice season two starts to sputter rather quickly before taking the series into nose dive it consists of paper thin plot which may be fine if it wasn also surprisingly light on action doesn help that the main actress of the show who plays the dhs agent delivers most of her lines like she was ventriloquist or that the main villain not only looks like jim carrey stunt double but acts about as well as him too perhaps it better that they didn green light the series for season three as it helped spare further ruination of potentially great character ', ' never wrote review or rated movie on imdb before but this one really should write because think this tv series is underrated and want to help others to understand why is that first what make daredevil is great is the story is so real mean there are reasons for everything ve seen breaking bad before and think it is the closest real life tv series daredevil is the second everyone responsible for their action there is no way someone get free for what they ve done second the fight scenes are the best the reason that make me want to watched this tv series is one of the fight scene that my friend shared on twitter daredevil just make higher level of fight scene for any other movie you don just see the good guy beat up the bad guys moreover you see the good guy also beaten up throw sloppy punch and kick got wounded plus the choreography and cinematography also good the last daredevil brings me nostalgic moment with nolan the dark knight that miss lot because of its dark silence calmness thrilling scene along the movie and its beautiful real life and reasonable story ', ' hate it will never watch it again will never eve see it again its the most awful movie have ever seen hate hate it hate it ', ' it is by far my favorite superhero series on netflix it has awesome writing great cast scary villains and great story got to watch all three seasons after the series ended so the mere fact that couldn peel myself away for watching until it was over makes difference in my review ', ' as an avid comic book fan and reader daredevil tickled my fancy and after watching both seasons don regret it charlie cox subtle elegance to matt murdock and his rough violent nature portrayed through daredevil is true comic adaptation vincent onofrio wilson fisk is definitely the best villain out of all of marvel netflix shows and his character is nailed through his performance ', ' didn mind it too much but in the grand scheme of mcu films there are quite few better ones out there the characters themselves are relatively easy to relate to but the story line reaches bit which found hard to grasp ', ' the goods about this movie are what makes it spy movie it acted well by everyone and serves purpose in the mcu unfortunately this movie was long overdue and is overshadowed by the events of endgame it a filler movie that is an average spy film think the humor works most of the time too the bads of this film well the fact it was too late it a filler movie so compare to filler episode in shows it a very average spy movie it goes back to generic boring villain similar to what we saw in early mcu films and it an average boring one even for spy movie the cgi is very bad especially in the third act what this movie sets up could be exciting but was pretty disappointed with this film overall still think it slightly above average think the goods do carry little bit more weight than the bads ', ' this series is not like marvel series acting and storyline both are very bad dont like first two episode hope next episode will be better after wanda vision my expectation is more high hope upcoming episode of ms marvel give us marvel universe feelings ', ' the short answer is no this is not marvel content it a show made for teenagers with demographic around 13yo girls nothing wrong with that but it doesn have the level of quality was expecting in any category except maybe the visual effects the scenes are made in parodying manner with cringe jokes and annoying characters where everything is predictable and nothing is even remotely convincing this show is mess regardless of the target audience ', ' this programme is win for diversity white female lead who sleeps with black man lesbians for the sake of being there rather than their sexual preferences somehow making difference to the plot and straight chicks who talk about things other than men when they re in the same room together add that to the currently trendy scandiavian noir feel the programme aiming for traumatised lead because lead just has to be flawed in hollywood monotonous punchy retort style dialogue and arty camera angles to show off how clever it all is and it difficult to get past just how utterly contrived jessica jones is if however you don let any of that bother you there a super hero angle to appeal to fans of the genre vaguely interesting villain who appears to drive the series but is again nothing we haven seen before and the unspoken promise that this could only get better if it doesn become even more self absorbed than it already is to be honest given the hype after 2 episodes m very disappointed then again given all the hype and high ratings may just give it 2 more episodes to see if it improves though let look at the facts imdb rankings lost their credibility long time ago already ', ' loved all the old marvel films and series but with this we understand what the disney is doing to marvel action is ridiculous and the plot is awful ', ' don let that kids review this great title or even inmature people they don know about the punisher they only want to see blood in stupid ways but the punisher has deep history and they managed very well in this program hope that you don follow the critics that put this 5 3 2 or 1 because easily this deserve more than 8 is the best of all the movies that make him seem like joke special the last one this is the true one cant wait for 2 season hope they make another masterpiece like this season ', ' m 60 white guy who read marvel comics as boy and have seen everything marvel since it hit the big screen ms marvel is different from other marvel and that a good thing love seeing people who don look like me dealing with the world from their own point of view it makes me wiser when thinking about issues to learn how to think like others it called empathy this is really nice take on the mcu from kid point of view keep it up disney one of my favorite lines out of moon knight is perfect for ms marvel kid looks at layla and asks are you an egyptian superhero yes am it perfect the superheros of early marvel where white male and of clearly northern european descent black widow and wanda maximov were pretty marginalized ms marvel opens door to the much appreciated expansion of the live action marvel universe to match the in print marvel universe thank you disney ', ' this movie is amazing all the elements can really we can enjoy the action but more than that this movie is very touching with fake family background but there is real relationship between them it a good message for us to respect our families know this is not review it more an expression of admiration about this film and of course really like black widow this is my favorite movie ', ' greatest acting great graphics great seriess love this series am from india and love this because this series is from our neighbourhood pakistan there is no hate between us we love each other the people who are critising the cast are the people who don get food without certificates from home goat series exists is the ms marvel ', ' this movie should be around scarlet johannes personality and viewers would be connected to the movie but exact opposite this movie will fail that goal and definitely disappoint you ', ' sure it doesn beat the first captain marvel which kevin feige did confirm this is direct sequel to the first one it definitely doesn deserve the hate it gets you don really need to watch anything else besides the first captain marvel to understand everything that going on you also could watch ms marvel for better understanding but if you have an idea for what the character is you would probably understand just about everything action in this movie happens more often than you expect right as the movie begins it jumps straight into the action which enjoy the action sequences are pretty intense and fun to watch the cast in this is pretty good it mainly brie larson and samuel jackson who put the show on humor in this movie is surprisingly balanced extremely well ms marvel iman vellani is the one who pulls off most of the humor in this there a solid amount of emotion in this movie it doesn really happen until the third act and it depends whether or not if it hits you or not it not touchy feely but more of disappointing type of emotion overall the marvels conveys solid fun movie to enjoy if you enjoyed it as much as me you may rewatch it in year or two but it not one to keep you on your toes when it gets released on disney plus ', ' being movie buff just want to convey that this movies is bad and dumb at the same time just don waste your brain here hated this ', ' captain marvel is one of the best serials available and true credit to the genre it offers plenty of the old school two fisted action that you expect from an action serial in addition to state of the art for the time flying effects the production value of the series is fantastic including great stuntwork fight sequences and innovative cliffhangers it also offers great running mystery as to the identity of the scorpion which is ruined if you happen to read the cast list closely above if you re fan of serials or old action movies in general you do well to pick this up as it truly is classic ', ' took me few days but think ve processed the marvels enough didn much care for it didn hate it but didn love it it sits somewhere in between mediocrity and fun loved the ms marvel bits but only because saw the show and was aware of her think she a precious cinnamon roll that must be protected at all cost but digress in franchise that at thier worst was little bland but visually stunning this ine phoned in the special effects m sure the animators must have been over worked and under paid likewise for the writing team the dialog felt forced and unnatural most times unpopular opinion but am fan of brie larson she has the chops to be amazing but she feels stilted especially when the suit comes on but worst if all was tayonna parris monica rambo she was great in wandavision felt her pain and wanted her story to have some weight all we got here was some awkward drama and she felt one note it wasn until the post credits that she felt like an actual character and don get me started on the supporting cast don think marvel knows what to do with fury anymore overall don want to hate this movie but it there at the bottom alongside black widow and the eternals as bland and uninspired and thay hurts to say maybe rewrite here and there and fleshing out some of the charactersmight have worked the villain of the piece though get they all don have to be relatable or scary but they have to have presence weather hamming it up or being intimidating they have to be foil this forgetable villain had nothibg going for them despite actually having good reason to be the movie as whole felt like there was potential but just fell short in so many ways ', ' very exciting series with reckless wars and fights and away from marvel childish politics jon bernthal is the best punisher hope the next seasons will be made ', ' an abysmal experience slow and boring storyline from d list marvel character very few care about wasted money and potential if they wanted to make an excellent show they should have based it on storm or 23 instead ', ' we love seeing strong women but there so little else of interest here that had to stop watching during the 4th episode of season 2 maybe enjoyable for some but had expectations of better after season 1 is the liquor industry financing this stuff sales pitch to kids for booze ', ' sure based on the first episode it is certainly not comparable to the level wanda vision or moon knight and loki each unique in their own ways but this doesn mean that it not interesting in its own way seeing the conflict between teenage girl and her family well it also kind of fun get the rather low ratings of 3 or 6 that just means this show is not meant for you doesn necessarily mean it bad but 23 5 of 1 that really just mean you are purposefully targetting this show for some weird reasons because however unsuitable it is for you it does not deserve the lowest rating this show gets an 8 for me at the moment but had to raise it to 10 to counter the 1 star bombing ', ' have feeling most of the low scores are from people that haven watched and who think it giving some leftist politics anything but this show is all about faith family hard work traditional marriage etc very very conservative these people need to actually watch and see they are wrong ', ' this series is surprisingly respectable for something from marvel unfortunately the makers were incredibly sloppy too often nothing matches to another so it is ridiculous instead of thrilling ', ' this movie is the definition of being over hyped hardly any aspect of it has escaped being hailed as among the best of recent years be it acting special effects fighting scenes or plot in my opinion it falls far far short of that benchmark the visual effects are very good sure but then so are the effects in battleship the acting isn bad but it hardly impressive either the few impressive performances are completely overshadowed by the very average writing platitudes one liners soundbites and trailer lines are constant much of it makes no sense at all bruce banner mark ruffalo is cautious about the other one and seems to dislike people knowing about it yet he constantly references this it as if the writers thought we haven shown banner as the hulk yet better make him allude to that in his every line so people don forget the largest problem with the movie without doubt is the plot the bad guy never feels threatening his plan is extremely inefficient and frankly stupid in many ways and the plot holes are too many to count for instance in one scene we see the hulk being mindless beast destroying everything in his path but later we see him taking orders add to that that the superhero who apparently has the power of super aim misses whenever the script calls for it making his on screen superpower is really good with bow and arrow in one scene he misses half dozen shots from distance of 12 feet on related note what is captain americas superpower compared to the others patriotism other avengers are superiour in every single way ranged combat close combat mobility intelligence strength even his weapon is worse version of thors hammer not that black widow is any better but at least she has some use in the plot this movie is like the expendables only it takes itself seriously and has better acting it is thoroughly unimpressive and how it currently has rank of 57 of all time movies is truly baffling ', ' and watch daredevil it is fantastic the acting writing fight choreography and cinematography are sublime season 3 is the best yet m eagerly awaiting the next season ', ' feel like after black panter and infinity war people expectation of marvel movies went up so high that they judged this one bit unfairly wouldn say this is there best movie out but it was definitely entertaining to watch ', ' following an excruciatingly prolonged waiting period at last we have stand alone feature on natasha romanoff aka black widow except for hawkeye she was the only one from that og avengers team who hadn got movie dedicated to them hitherto having said that m afraid it not what we ve been waiting for right from the beginning was noticing some incongruities in its narrative disposition which appeared to have an acute scarcity in terms of consistency and integrality while it did have subtexts regarding misogyny male chauvinism and all the other stuff of social relevance the screenplay bristled with its own quandaries had not been able to generate acceptable outcomes reckon volitionally got myself invested in all this whacky family drama at the early stages in hopes of getting onto something more substantial however down the line in quite befuddling manner things started to get redundant and unimaginative only then realized this is not going to work out superficial character depictions and incompetent writing these two main factors are to be blamed for as consequence the entire narration fell flat and was unable to capitalize on the sentimental sides of the storyline such constrictive way of storytelling reigns supreme anytime there a bit of action going chase sequences fist fights guns explosions quick witted humor all very conventional marvel stuff but that when it achieves the most not to mention it has largely benefited from bunch of impressive visual effects for the most part and stimulating score along the same lines speaking of performances scarlett johansson as the leading protagonist did the best she could as expected she been consistently doing the same for years now so no real surprise there david harbour and rachel weisz were welcome additions but they were gravely underutilized serviceable at best the standout was definitely florence pugh without doubt strongly believe her portrayal of yelena soon gonna end up being fan favorite at the end of the day just wanna ask is this even relevant at this point as we are all aware of the fact that they have already eradicated the character of black widow from their cinematic universe therefore she won be playing any part in the next phase phase iv whatsoever so why now why not couple of years back isn it too late ', ' but this is up there one of the best netflix series out there addictive and well worth the watch ', ' disney have definitely been butchering lot of shows and this one is not an exception it was basically like watching disney channel tv show from the 00s ok so it showed muslims as being regular people which is nice to see on tv but it made india partition and subsequent civil war basically look like minor arguement not personally fan of iman vellani as the lead she just bit too goofy and dopey would be better to get less disney actress and more superheroesque one also do disney not think we notice 20 year old pretending to be 15 16 come on guys we re not blind ', ' bad was in high hopes but this movie is just arghhhh fight scenes badly done script is just bad started high and just went downhill this movie doesn deserve it current ratings was waiting when it will end bored ', ' they ruined my boo taskmaster and the movie was almost as bad as captain marvel maybe women shouldn be in charge of making movies only gets 2 stars because loved florence pugh so much ', ' most of the reviews here were put badly regarding to season 2 while see season 1 is the worst one ever ', ' its basic turning red but not enjoyable thought maybe marvek learned they shouldn do kids shows or movies because it just seems like that meme where the guy tries to be cool around the kids ', ' the accents are horrible pugh especially has zero ability to keep it consistent extremely boring story fight scene to fight scene with zero soul not even women will enjoy this all women made movie tv movie director needed to be replaced she couldn make this enjoyable or keep actors accountable scarlett is tired like an old dog to think she sued for more money this would have bombed alongside other blockbusters they did you favor ', ' ultimately it not the greatest mcu film made but it is great film it gets the story across and does so in humorous genuine entertaining way it nice to see representation it nice to see an origin story that hasn been beaten to death before and it damn nice to see hero who shoots when it time to shoot instead of allowing monologuing carol danvers forever ', ' why marvel thinks the audience are stupid story is not so attractive actions are not so good too much special affects made it fantasy ', ' have high expectations this movie is not the best marvel movie but not bad either ', ' this is worst marvel show have ever seen recommend to see nickelodeon show in it place bad casting of ms marvel it has potential to be the worst show in the history of television this girl is loud annoying and wannabe superhero ', ' it is quite unfortunate that after iron man and the incredible hulk the marvel films switched from being serious films to complete jokes was expecting the avengers to be really bad film however instead of being painful to watch like iron man 2 captain america and thor the avengers is really entertaining as whole it is certainly an interesting film it is sort of like the movie machete except much better it has b movie feel to it but is extremely entertaining the villain is so clich it is hysterical part of what really makes this movie shine is the horrible acting and dialogue by several of the actors and actresses the three worst actors in the movie are loki the villain played by tom hiddleston nick fury played by samuel jackson and agent maria hill played by colbie smulders while the idea of watching movie with horrible dialogue may not be appealing to some there is another side to the movie that works well in an admirable fashion and that is the super heroes particularly iron man the hulk and captain america these actors really add some emotion and movie star pizazz to the movie in the same way that liam neeson did for the phantom menace which is probably the worst movie of all time the effects and action scenes are all top notch though some of the action scenes with the black cat and hawkeye are little unconvincing considering they are just normal humans with no super powers or technology nonetheless it is fun to also see robert downey jr make fun of the campiness and unbelievable other avengers ', ' solid movie with great characters entertaining and probably the best take on this character ever done this has been review bombed but if you take out the reviews of all the sexists and racists this is scoring higher the black panther and that saying something ', ' found the show way too cliche combine all the past marvel tropes and stuff em into nickelodeon teen show and this is what you get plus the show is very slow with hardly anything interesting happening for 30 mins or so visuals are cool tho ', ' awesome story line cool characters funny parts definetly fills in some gaps if you love marvel you ll like the movie ', ' the way am seeing it it kinda frist time ever saw that pakistani are include in american superhero show and am impress watch all of them adn say sooo loving it they way bring karachi in movie is soo amazing and and main actor is doing amazing act and wish can see what will happen next to kamala khan cant wait for more episode keep up the good work marvel studios ', ' was entirely excited to watch this until did watch it once you ll see for yourself know it only the first episode but you will question why you decided to watch this ', ' dragged my heels when it came to avengers assemble did really want to see yet another comic book adaptation that will be rehashed in ten years for viewers with goldfish memories the amazing spider man being case in point apparently did ve never been great reader of graphic novels though dipped into the odd batman and flash gordon book while still building camps in hedges but in recent years my forays into pictorial literature have been less frequent and more specific the favoured and most notable examples being joe sacco palestine and particular high point for me m dematteis the compleat moonshadow but digress avengers assemble concerned me with so many disappointing and occasionally disastrous adaptations out there the league of extraordinary gentlemen both of the hulk adaptations to date what hope was there for film that threw together smorgasbord of superheroes all vying for top billing one of which hasn been tested on the public with big screen outing of her own with so many egos and so little time it would be task and half for the scriptwriter joss whedon to adequately divvy out the lines needn have concerned myself with such trivialities whedon who also directs does an admirable job of bouncing the dialogue between characters without swaying too heavily in one direction there isn a clear star in this grand ensemble piece although that success leads to new issue in that none are able to engage us with fully fleshed out story of their own it doesn matter with the likes of robert downey jnr iron man who has had two hugely successful outings but is frustrating in the case of scarlet johansson black widow there no need to go into detail on the plot it a superhero flick so naturally something or someone loki thor adopted brother in this instance threatens the existence of mankind and the superheroes fly into action to save the day it formulaic but lot of fun if not particularly original or inspiring it difficult to surprise cinema goers nowadays and plots are recycled embellished and reimagined more often than conceived but that needn be major issue in genre film on this scale when the viewer isn demanding any more than to be entertained the cast is superb and in the case of the principals either recognizable as stars in their own right or courtesy of the roles they are reprising here mostly they do as you expect and deserve neither great plaudits nor condemnation it not that kind of film however beyond the obvious star billed cast there are some who delight absolutely tom hiddleston wallander the deep blue sea as loki is effortlessly compelling and avoids melodrama in his wickedness that so many villains lean towards while jeremy renner the hurt locker the town is an actor who been around for few years and co starred in number of excellent if not huge films as clint barton he again lends solid support and proves to be most watchable and compelling actor it just pity that he given little opportunity to develop his alter ego hawkeye and one can only hope the inevitable sequel will rectify that the unexpected quality comes in the form of the hulk with two major hollywood adaptations to date the kindest comment one can make is that their stars eric bana and edward norton were both put to shame by the dated bill bixby performance in avengers assemble though mark ruffalo truly shines as the tortured reluctant recruit bruce banner the cg big green lump is created more convincingly though still not flawlessly here than in previous attempts but it as banner that ruffalo proves himself for once we have portrayal of banner that lays his soul bare for us all to see the demons running around inside it and at last m actually looking forward to the solo outing they must surely give ruffalo hulk let just hope it third time lucky another film review from the squiss for more reviews from the squiss subscribe to my blog at www thesquiss co uk ', ' this is one of the most awaited movies of all time and for the legions of fans in asia the wait is going to be over soon for those who have not yet booked their tickets suggest that they do so preferably at the imax cineplex where the action in 3d can be overwhelming must say was bit skeptical that writer director joss whedon creator of tv buffy the vampire slayer and angel can pull off this six in one superhero flick will it be like assembling six major egos in small room and cramming their style with the plot of six against one loki wouldn that be overkill and unfair advantage will the storyline plot measure up to the cgi and effects that take up major part of its us 220 million budget will this disney effort follow in the heels of john carter and go downhill all these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie when we find earth being threatened by demi god loki tom hiddleston and nick fury samuel jackson the head of h e d for strategic homeland intervention enforcement and logistics division starts the avenger initiative from here on it is pure marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order you can bet this one is going to put whedon among the ranks of top directors like spielberg and cameron those who have seen captain america last year may remember the tesseract the all powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean loki the megalomaniacal brother of thor chris hemsworth manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world to stop him fury and his assistant natasha romanoff black widow scarlett johansson assemble the various superheroes on his massive helicarrier in preparation for war against loki forces these include steve rogers captain america chris evans tony stark iron man robert downey jr dr bruce banner the hulk mark ruffalo and thor special agent clint barton or hawkeye jeremy renner makes up the sixth member bit later when manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters the climactic battle takes up almost all of the final half hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough thanks to cleverly written script that incorporates fine balance of sincerity and self effacing wit indeed before the avengers battle the alien invaders they fight one another both physically and verbally like iron man quips when he first meets thor what this shakespeare in the park and does your mother know you re wearing her drapes indeed the punchlines are more powerful and memorable than the real punches whedon does not waste time re introducing his characters we are already familiar with iron man captain america and thor the physical talents of scar jo black widow are introduced in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss agent coulson on hold have always wondered how mark ruffalo will fare as the hulk and am surprised he almost ran away with the show his dr banner is mellow guy hiding out in india before being persuaded by natasha to join the avengers on board fury helicarrier we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check you must have been doing lot of yoga someone jokes and yes when the hulk emerges it is really incredible also watch out for marvel comics stan lee who gets self effacing one liner during the action scenes one of the misses of this film is that natalie portman jane is left out of thor story except for picture this is in contrast to stark relationship with pepper potts gwyneth paltrow which takes up quite few scenes and even though he has to face off against six superheroes hiddleston loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain of course jackson finally has proper role here after cameos in the previous iron man and captain america films it really isn about whether you re going to catch the avengers it how many times you will want to see it ', ' worst series have seen boring dark and full of loopholes ', ' brilliant luckily was able to take my tweens to this movie to packed house on opening night this is now their favorite movie rarely have been to film in recent years that has the audience cheering and clapping as the closing credits start and this is one of them from start to finish it is well played well paced and spectacular to watch the movie begins where last years captain america and thor left off with thor brother loki playing the villain lot of super hero occasionally physics defying action ensues as the team is brought together as well as some well placed humor marvel studios will have hard task improving on this and already my 11 year old wants to see it again had so much fun watching this one wouldn mind seeing it again myself go see it you won be disappointed ', ' initially tried watching this show after it came out and was bored to tears by the 3rd episode where began fast forwarding it just to finish it and see if something actually happened by the end after just finishing luke cage decided to try and give this show another shot and here am one episode in wondering how on earth anyone can find it enjoyable and what on earth happened at marvel that would allow this mess to air krysten ritter tries way too hard to be the stoic bad ass strong female character and it embarrassing and painful to watch her acting is so flat and wooden that cannot find anything compelling about her character to make me care about her or anything that happens to her her lisbeth salander wannabe dgaf attitude used to mask her inner turmoil is while compelling albeit overused trope it done with such listlessness in regards to writing and acting that it just reminds me of the angsty phase teenagers go through rather than captivating plot device it truly shame because her character really could have been something special it a combination of terrible erratic writing and bad acting from her that starts this show off on the wrong foot david tennant shines here and is honestly the only redeeming aspect of this show he provides great multidimensional character that is entertaining compelling and fun to watch the story could easily have been condensed into movie and it shows by all the useless side characters crammed into the plot clogging it up when anything starts to actually happen and the sex scenes why oh why do need to see two people going at it so frequently sex scenes can fit in just fine to shows and movies but here it just another excuse to prolong an already thin story the lack of chemistry between luke and jessica makes these scenes all the more awkward and frankly useless as another reviewer stated it like walking in on your parents except with this show they force you to stay and watch my frustration is that this could have been something really great in fact it should have been something great marvel has done fantastic job for the most part creating these great shows and films there was good material to work with but it suffered from lazy redundant and just plain bad writing generally notice editing lighting and camera work with anything watch but here was so disinterested with this show that found myself staring at the wall thinking about what was going to have for breakfast instead of actually watching the show if don care for certain aspects of tv or film can at least manage to stay engaged because other aspects are keeping me interested the dark washed out colors of this show drown the visuals into muddy shots that at least reflect the dreary boring nature of the story with jessica jones its monotonous story telling monotonous voice overs bad acting and terrible writing lends nothing aside from tennant to keep me engaged if anything you can put this show on as background noise but aside from that it not good for much else ', ' am hardcore mcu fan growing up reading marvel comics back in the 90s fresh from my mcu marathon ending with endgame was skeptical of shows like wandavision or falcon winter soldier which had premises that didn sound interesting to me but ended up really liking black widow was movie also had little interest in but from my recent experiences thought d give it the benefit of the doubt and hope it would get some of that mcu magic alas there is very little about that movie liked first and foremost the fake russian accents coming and going for no reason really irked me it really didn help what thought were subpar acting performances from actors know can deliver ton more than they do here johansson harbour weisz etc the directing was all over the place action scenes were hot mess and some of the special effects were disgrace for something with the mcu stamp on it the story and writing have so many plot holes and things that don make sense m not going to even try and count them very disappointing overall and by far the weakest mcu movie to date just skip that one ', ' season 1 was great season 2 is not where should even start the plot and story is clich predictable and boring almost every character in season 2 gets annoying as the show progress know this show was released on women day and wants to honor women but this season is over saturated with feminism to the point where it is unbearable jessica jones was promising show but season 2 evidently destroyed that huge disappointment ', ' the avengers catch it the anticipation for the avenger movie is undeniable we have been waiting for this from years to understand the avenger movie it really important that you ve seen all previous ironman the incredible hulk thor and captain america movies as the avenger give time to build characterizations for their heroes so getting into the avengers empty headed about hero history will be foolish the avenger brings back our beloved marvel heroes tony stark iron man thor dr bruce banner hulk steve rogers captain america natasha romanoff black widow clint barton hawkeye agent maria hill agent phil coulson and director nick fury each hero journey starts from where it ended in their respective movies now the avenger stands strong in every department from direction production and performances it won be wrong to say that it brings out the best out of all the heroes the humor action and graphics are far brilliant than all the previous marvel movies combined the credit goes to generous brain of joss whedon he brings out something very special out of each superhero the interaction between all superheroes is something we don see often they tease make fun and even fight with each other robert downey jr ironman is great as always he brings his charming personality and wicked humor into his character which made him the superstar of today chris hemsworth thor is truly god of thunder his entry is as big as thor entry should be it makes you jump of your seat and cheer for him chris evens captain america is indeed the ultimate american hero he got the charm and personality of true america hero some of the most standout moments in the movie belong to mark ruffalo the incredible hulk for the first time we see some humor in the actions of hulk he is just not fury green monster this time around besides hulk the biggest surprise is scarlett johansson black widow we have seen the part of her in ironman movie but this time around we completely understand the strength and wickedness of black widow she is absolutely stunning and fantastic jeremy renner hawkeye is good and hope to see him someday with black widow they had this amazing chemistry which requires further attention clark gregg cobie smulders and samuel jackson the h i d are fun to watch tom hiddleston loki is superb he was the ultimate villain and considering his brilliant performance in thor he has out done himself again gwyneth paltrow pepper potts appearance is appreciated and would have loved to see natalie portman jane foster in it too on the whole the avengers is the finest brilliant superhero movie of all time it filled with great performance humor action graphics and brilliant direction highly recommended in 3d ', ' can believe how back marvel messed this up it easily the worst movie put out by marvel in the past few years ', ' appreciate this film for what it is an all out action popcorn movie that aims to wow the audience with its cutting edge effects fancy camera work and ability to not have to think and just sit back the plot was pretty simple and nothing new in terms of old clich alien guy tries to take over the world with his army and big doomsday device scenario with an ending we have seen million times before with lets destroy city with as much explosions and cgi as possible chapter don get me wrong they did great job with it some of the camera work was excellent much better than micheal bay close up and shake the camera around everywhere technique but for me personally don like being overwhelmed with all the cgi and the camera taking me away from the characters involvement of the scene and scenario and focusing on the effects the only thing that kept me going till the end was the humor if it was not for that would have rated this film as just another bland cgi bonanza good attempt but for me not as amazing as everyone is making it out to be the effect are amazing the humor is good but everything else seen it before bored of it ', ' let me start by saying don watch the show anymore so don know thought that they were going to incorporate things from the marvel movies but the only thing we got was coulson and nick fury one thing that was upsetting is that it is made by joss weadon who really enjoy for him to go from something like the avengers to this is very upsetting and disappointing although it has great actors like clark gregg and cobbie smaulders it failed thought that it was kinda stupid it drags on and on and on and finally after 5 episodes had enough it wasn what expected wanted to watch it more but just went back to arrow expected this to be an easy 7 10 but it ended up being at most 5 10 ', ' 7 10 season one was refreshing to see superhero series without any spectacular action or cgi effects and still being good marvel jessica jones is drama relying on good acting solid plot detective pi work to get the work done the series is targeted at adults with believable action sequences and depiction of sexuality the darker side of crime my complaints are the show could have been shorter could have easily given us the same story in crisper manner also jones always seems to be using her super power in very controlled manner unlike the brazen use by the bad guy felt it more to do with the lack of cgi budget why make super hero action show and skip out on action sequences jessica jones with her abrasive personality is difficult role to play but still krysten ritter does good job of it with jones what you see and what you get are just opposite she looks delicate with her petite body frame but has super strength she is an alcoholic but got quick mind always sarcastic rude but got caring heart david tennant shines as kilgrave the smartly dressed bad guy who has the power of mind control his portrayal of narcissistic sociopath is the best part of the series the show got great supporting characters that give excellent performances and each and every one have this unique weird chemistry with the jessica jones mike colter as luke cage brings in the guilt ridden love interest his intriguing past and characterization propelling him to get show for himself rachael taylor is great as trish patsy walker step sister at times side kick and the emotional pillar for jessica jones her charming characterization at times overshadow the jones carrie anne moss is good as the cold blooded lawyer although felt she was underutilized this is not superhero series it more vigilantly pi vs super villain series and good one at that 4 10 season two found the season to be too long underwhelming and missing climax its lack of bad guy didn help it either the subplots were not needed and the main plot lacked focus it was nice going while we had an element of suspense on who is the powered killer but ones we get to know that it all went downhill the relationship issues bought up are complicated but dragging it along for so long and ending it the way it did just didn work for me in the earlier season had loved trish walkers role in this one we had an overdose of her still with her headstrong personality and wanting to play hero it would be interesting to see what patsy does in the future the show hangs on krysten ritter performance but even she couldn interest me to binge watch it first marvel netflix haven binge watched also what was it with no mention of defenders no cameos by any one of them the inter connection of the marvel world of netflix makes it more interesting and fun this was such let down ', ' hope they make more longer versions of these my son loves them ', ' jessica jones character is compelling but the cast is strange ensemble trish character is bland shallow consistently irritating no personality whatsoever someone should shoot her just because the main character has some depth doesnt mean others don need to bother not sure the english lead villain is strong enough for the part either he not menacing enough ', ' good fun good humour and action packed the marvels is reminiscent of phase 1 and 2 mcu so if you hanker for bit of of old school marvel this is definitely for you watching ms marvel beforehand is must and as that series is quite good it not big ask the only negative for me was the villain played by zawe ashton m not sure if it was the direction script or acting but the character didn quite work for me that said james spader ultron had the same effect on first viewing but improved on subsequent views better than recent marvel efforts quantumania and love and thunder and m not saying they were terrible quite enjoyed them but on scale the marvels is better ', ' disney is sink ship and now try to sink marvel too don know what they are trying to do by confronting the parents but judging by the quality they spew and the strong attendance these facts speak volumes fifteen minutes is enough for person to see that for so much money comes out round zero in better quality the shoddy 3d effects can even be seen am not at all surprised that the halls were empty even here in bulgaria things were the same way the few who visited the theaters watched exactly 15 20 minutes before getting up and leaving the halls don think we ll see any more good marvel movies because after stan lee death they turned him over to some rundown yard ', ' don believe the mcu bros who don want to see 3 women superheros this movie was really exciting for fans of the comics it was very funny and the emotional tone was engrossing and satisfying the themes of family and the challenges that the literal strongest humans in this universe face in being part of family we re both meaningful and not forced m excited for more movies with all these characters if have one critique it a similar critique that would give to many superhero movies which is that the villain could have more complexity in their story arc otherwise marvelous movie ', ' having already seen wandavision this series of what seems like trailers of past character arcs is massive disappointment im not entirely sure who they thought would be interested in this or why they want to waste money on it honestly the mind boggles not much better than fan edit really ', ' had similar feel to spiderman was done really well but it just too slow absolutely chock full of filler take out the tiny bit of action repackage it as family drama my kids aren enjoying it either so it not an age thing missed opportunity ', ' it right up there with the incredible hulk brie larson has smug smile and no dimension bit of jason statam vin diesel all powerful greatness the storyline was dull cat and fury eye stole the show ', ' only saw 1 episode and half and it was more than enough for me probably the violence is meant to portray something about the characters and it definitely raises some strong emotions only in my case the main emotion was revulsion and general state of need to cleanse myself after watching this wonder what the target audience of this series and if they actually enjoy watching this honestly it a shame because the acting seemed pretty good and found myself interested enough to try and ignore the fighting violent parts just to see if there something to the story then it got unecessarily gory and don even care whether there was story there in the first place m fairly convinced if there is one its meaning gets lost among the bloody scenes ', ' this movie is meant for those 8 and up it is also meant for those who like scifi fantasy the avengers group of single comic book heroes get together to save the world from lokki samuel jackson the head of the earth protective forces plays his role well the characters are shallow but let face it it comic book time it is fast paced and contains interesting toys and gadgets it works as great party movie loved the sets the colors and the characters all in one film thor even comes to the rescue all in all the movie is very entertaining and is well worth its greater than 2 hour booty killer time get bowl of pop corn and group of friends turn this movie into scifi party give it 5 thumbs up ', ' think it was okay but was disappointed in the movie the best thing in the movie was the sister don think ll be seeing it again ', ' read quite lot of comments the people who gave high score keep saying people think is bad because they don like the culture or don enjoy the actor and actress race it totally disagree if it is about the race why would people enjoy shang chi and black panther actually it is because the plot is super terrible lack of direction and poor organisation really enjoyed using partition as the background of ms marvel and the actor and actress but the terrible plot ruined everything ', ' this is fun movie it ties two tv shows into the lore and does good job of having fun does it add anything to the overall narative no does it highight ms marvel as fun addition hell yes once you get over its not adding anything or revealing any easter eggs you can enjoy it for what it is all three main characters deliver on their role and it improves on captain marvels solo outing sit down take any preconceived ideas you have remove any anticipation of easter eggs and enjoy it for what it is has marvel lost its way yes have the glorious days of intertwined writing and on screen narrative been left behind yes but as movie its fun ', ' this series made me hooked to it it is just mind blowing you ve got to watch this now when first my friend told me about ms marvel was like yeahh when get time felt it wouldn be as good as what brand marvel we know of but man did it exceed my expectations oh hell yes ', ' now this is movie that will recommend to anyone it is awesome been two times to see it in 3d already it have cost me the price of 42 already only for the tickets but it was worth every penny spent and for the coca cola and popcorn would say have spent about 55 only on the avengers but am guessing for the avenger ii and iii etc because with robert downey jr as iron man it is must see and waiting for the wolverine to come into the avengers saw iron man tony stark in the wolverine movie so there must be another coming with the wolverine also joining the avengers and is the biggest villain we see in the end thanos it must be it is for me only thanos and loki that are the interesting villains it was also time where jla and avengers met together and fought villains but not all jla and avengers characters are great the best ones we would as audience see together in battle for good feel is superman batman spiderman the wolverine captain america the hulk thor and the daredevil of the villains there are only some can think of that would be supercool in fight against evil the evilest of them all doomsday thanos loki luthor and zod am waiting and looking forward to the next round 10 10 on imdb com this movie is one of the greatest action adventure movies ever seen ll buy the blu ray when that gets out all of them ', ' now everyone is claiming it was good dispite the reviews however as south asian watched it and definitely feel it is over hyped and trying the free load on the whole south asian identity thing when it is well known fact that most pakistani muslims never identify yourself patience unless it beneficial they always refer to themselves as arabs or more closely to arab culture etc the main guy was just too annoying to watch the whole tried and tested corny scenes of being victim yes the only thing they did right was allowing kamala khan to have choice and not wearing hijab which was reasonable because most pakistani muslim girls living in america don wear hijabs well unless after their married is it worth watching it no is it overhyped yes other characters annoying yes the story feels very pushed us in they feel like they have to show us certain type of story this was definitely not aimed at wider audience but just to please certain audience ', ' understand why people voted this low they have no brains they don care for storytelling and they don like movies with guns and knives the people that called this show slow are the people that like michael bay movies they want fast fast fast payoff to everything they don understand how story is built especially an origin story never thought would think superhero tv show is beautiful this was beautiful parts of it gave me the same emotions as the first couple seasons of dexter at times this show did even more than dexter watching the punisher cry shows how strongly he feels but that also shows how strongly he can control his emotions when necessary this was the perfect piece of filmmaking ', ' the sports series had great potential at first it was quite good with good plot and good characters that enlarged its universe little more the problem with the series was not even the series it was the circumstance being marvel series and having very little budget for it and its plots having to align with what was going on in the marvel movies as they came out complicated things with its own plot and it still made for an acceptable series but when the series began to have its own problems it was when it died little by little because by achieving emotional moments that amounted to nothing since none of the characters were capable of dying and returning in so many different ways that it seemed like joke and it damaged the series each time the chapters became more and more boring and some repetitive was what killed the series without doubt good series despite everything that if had had freedom would have done quite well ', ' dumb such dumb movie did hate it and was actually thinking it was fairly decent halfway through then they decided to get intentionally goofy had no problem with the actors production value or even the musical cues the basic story is fine the initial set up and introductions were good enough liked the bad guy though wish they would have given her more development but you take pretty birthday cake and throw cat poop on it then hold it to the audience and say see how hilarious this is shame because don think even kids would like it who is responsible for these decisions that the question asked myself few times in the theater as sat through an experience that made wile coyote and the road runner feel both more grounded and entertaining in those old cartoons wasting powerful characters and an intriguing concept not to mention really good motivation for the villain has been marvel specialty in their movies lately let hope all these rumors about them resetting some things about how they produce content are true few more minutes developing each of the main characters would have made world of difference but instead they used that time for cat jokes and musical number are they trying to tank their brand ', ' who would ve thought pakistani american teenage girl is so damn relatable she basically peter parker with an added layer of outsiderness it shouldn demographically speak to me since m the polar opposite of her character but it stroked all my childhood love of spiderman plus this actress is likable as hell who would ve thought pakistani american teenage girl is so damn relatable she basically peter parker with an added layer of outsiderness it shouldn demographically speak to me since m the polar opposite of her character but it stroked all my childhood love of spiderman plus this actress is likable as hell ', ' after seeing all these characters in previous mcu movies we get to see them all come together it was so cool loki made fabulous villain and we got to see how smart this villain was this movie will always stick out in the mcu and will always be remembered ', ' if you enjoy marvel movies then you will surely enjoy this film if you do not then you will be sitting in your seat reliving your whole life asking yourself where did it all go wrong that how boring the film is before the film even started there was advertisement for black widow the film was about to watch this reminded me of how disney owns majority of popular franchises and have control of the film industry there was opening sequence where they played altered version of the song smells like teen spirit by artist kurt cobain hearing this was surreal as smells like teen spirit was one of there most disliked songs by kurt cobain that he made yet they used it know why they used it even though there are better songs which could of worked they could possibly offend someone thats why they used the most safe and most popular song of theirs even if it adds no substance this can describe the film in itself as it does nothing new and nothing interesting just wish that these film will stay on streaming platforms and not cinemas ', ' m fan of the mcu though some of it is laughably bad it fun this film feels like lazy cocaine filled f9 fast and furious film it horrendous story and characters are convoluted and nonsensical the dialogue hurts my ears the comedy is absent it there but there is no time where laughed or even half chuckled the cinematography is choppy and the cgi is laughably bad to showcase will describe scene from the film which is great example of the absurdity in this film and why m comparing this to fast and furious the two protagonists get in car and are in this very high speed chase their car then gets in crash where it flips over multiple times hits many objects then lands upside down and skids down flight of stairs the protagonists just get out of the car seconds later with nothing but scratch on the head this accompanied by horrendous cgi made me laugh out loud in the theater it was absolutely absurd and very unrealistic of course we can forget that they had to have been driving at least 50mph there are many more instances of this throughout film taking me out causing me to make jokes about it instead of pulling me in and causing me to be invested the mcu is unrealistic mean it superheroes but these protagonists are human with no super abilities every other mcu film ve seen had limits but this film not only took of the seatbelt but rode on top of the hood while drinking caffeine it insane this whole movie screams lazy and cheap yet this is massive multi million dollar blockbuster from marvel and disney pathetic ', ' it is difficult to say what is bad in here so ll just say everything do not waste your time on this one having so much around to see honestly envy the people who like this show you are so easy to entertain wish could ', ' not the best mcu show but does it own thing glad it exists it is childish like everyone else says but that is the point that is the character would say the show does have good style and it has actually funny humor ve only seen the first episode but just here for the support also it has realistic parents and teen drama ', ' it started out surprisingly good had some unique editing choices pretty great vfx compared to the other marvel shows but after about the 4th episode couldn help but asking myself what was even the point of the show the villains were easily some of the worst villains in any mcu entry even worse than thor 2 plenty of filler most of the time the plot wouldn even budge until there were 5 minutes left in the episode and totally unnecessary changes to the character from the source material honestly just the first marvel show watched where wish would ve saved my time the entire series can be explained in less than 5 sentences just waste of time overall ', ' aside from few points of humor this movie primarily features only endless lame fighting knocks down b gets up and knocks down a gets up repeat over and over and over apparently delightful to marvel fans tedious and banal to those who seek something other than the simplistic well worn pathway to adolescent male fantasy yes the special effects were well done though somewhat inconsistent why is the hulk so huge in some scenes so human scale in others why does the hulk fear his monster uncontrollability when it seems perfectly coordinated with the other superheroes during the fighting and perfectly peaceful afterward why is there no character development whatsoever oh right it marvel superheroes in stasis throwbacks to stupider time kept waiting for it to get interesting and then it was over sigh ', ' this was an excellent superhero movie personally don believe that the rumored justice league movie of 2013 starring superman batman the flash wonder woman and green lantern will have an easy time living up to this film the special effects were great and the 3d was very impressive think the hulk was an amazingly animated character and defiantly stole the show with his comedy action and overall awesomeness this film is defiantly worth the watch especially in 3d so hope that there will be sequel with many more heroes joining the avengers such as ant man black panther the fantastic 4 spider man or wolverine ', ' this one goes way beyond simply being the final chapter in themed series the individual marvel movies have been ok hulk to good iron man 1 but the avengers is an order of magnitude better than the best of them this film is good enough to appeal to the general public but for comic action fans its is an exquisite symphony much more than the sum of its parts you will find sublime pathos mixed with humor and it works believe it will become genre defining work as star wars and lord of the rings are it will simultaneously make you want to fight evil serve your country and believe that redemption is still possible for those ready to lay it on the line and become heroes ', ' am so thrilled marvel are expanding their content by paying homage to the many fantastic genres of media there are ms marvel is sensational addition to the newly explored types of movies and shows horror sitcom martial arts the teen comedy feel of the show is perfect for introducing the character seeing the world through her eyes but it still has the elements of classic superhero watch origin story overcoming adversity mysterious powers all that added to the brill representation of south asian and muslim women with narrative that focused on them as real people it a top hit for me that will inspire many out there and will bring new group of people to the fandom ', ' have loved most of the marvel shows disney has made besides falcon and winter soilder which was kind of mid this show is just on another level of not doing it for me keep going into each episode hoping they make it better but in my opinion they make it worse every week ', ' action packed thrilling exciting and the best marvel movie period ', ' it was hard to stay awake during this movie that how boring it is almost walked out to go sit in the lobby it so boring don care what kind of agenda is being pushed in this movie just don be boring could not stop nodding off during this movie even though this movie is only an hour and half it was too long and hard to care about anything going on ve seen both oppenheimer and flowers of the killer moon and never once felt tired during those and both are over 3 hours actually didn mind the first captain marvel movie it was alright don think it deserved all the hate that it got but this one is terrible and maybe the worst marvel movie yet which is sad because eternals thor 4 ant man 3 and shang chi exists two of the biggest problems with this movie for me were nick fury and ms marvel it sad what nick fury has been reduced to now his character is now joke and it about time for sam jackson to hang it up with this character there is scene towards the end with his character and cats evacuating ship that is so stupid if would have come alone would have walked out don know anything about ms marvel because didn waste my time watching the disney show and after seeing this and seeing how annoying she is will never watch that show her voice and her yelling were so damn annoying think this is it folks marvel is truly dead but truthfully it been dead way before phase 4 or whatever phase this is there just no iron man or captain america to hide how bad these movies are anymore and no amount of cameos from 2000 marvel films fan service or backing brinks truck up to robert downey jr house is going to save these movies either ', ' just ask yourself this if it wasn for daredevils reputation or this being netflix original series would you have seen it with different eyes started watching the series expecting the same quality as daredevil but soon after 4 episodes had to face the fact that this is nowhere near daredevils quality and that you end up not caring about the main character at all she an emotional wreck ball she complicates everything with her emotional pretty little liars attitude all the time and it becomes really annoying really quick was expecting good tv series with great female lead role but frankly this is not it the 3 10 it because of how it filmed that it really looks professional or high quality besides that the acting and the scripts belong in soap opera ', ' probably the weakest mcu film series the lead actress casting decision was wrong the finale episode was the worst fawad khan mehwish hayat looked good though really hope marvel quality checks the content it serving to the audience this series was so bad ', ' not something special it really can have be seen this movie costs lot but it kind of boring one and it has long duration ', ' liked the comics and the ben affleck movie they had some violence as any other superheroes fiction and started to see the fist episodes but couldn handle it because its violence there are horrible goring scenes too much for me this kind of explicit brutality has never been seen in marvel based movie the director should have omitted these long and awful sequences because they doesn add nothing to the plot they have tried to make the people really hate the bad guys of the movie to justify the evil tortures that the superheroe makes to them definitely don like these gore trend there are much better ways of storytelling than this ', ' honestly don get why people are bashing this movie it was brilliant movies play risk of retro and sometimes it can be cheesy but in my opinion marvel didn miss beat and they didn it justice brie was fantastic and her dynamic with samuel jackson was great it made you root for them it has moments that make you laugh without taking away from what they are doing massively like this film make your own decisions and see it ', ' then half way into the movie came to screeching halt and crashed into disappointment ', ' who are this people giving ratings above for this medocre show superhero is boring cgi is terrible plot is pathetic actors are lifless indo pak sentiments lol this is not some cricket match or debate to talk about the partition stories every single episode after seeing the 4 episodes am suggesting imdb to include negative rating don want marvel to continue with this anymore don tell me this would be added in captain marvel movie ', ' let me start by saying was really looking forward to this show and gave it solid chance but the amount of blatant and purposeful feminazism and average at best writing made this such disappointment there was less feminazism in all the season of orange is the new black combined than the first episode of jessica jones the feminazism hits you like truck within the first few minutes and keeps piling it on the only strong characters in the show are women except luke cage which they had to show him as strong male figure due to him having his own show although if they portrayed luke the same way there would be no hope for his spin off show other than luke cage every male is show as either weak psychotic close minded or pathetic think the actors and actresses did the best they could with such lackluster script krysten ritter pulls off great performance and plays jessica to t with her timing and cold demeanor david tennant gives such an incredible performance as killgrave that found myself rooting for him the entire series mike colter acting on the other hand is so abysmal kept thinking that luke cage would have been so much better if michael jai white was given the role instead he played spawn in the movie overall it an okay show to pass the time with but is not one would watch again after have seen it the amount of blatant sexism in the show makes it quite cringe worthy and irritating ', ' rather sad that this adventure has ended it has at times tested the limits of astrophysics and cosmology but that is what makes thsi series so interesting and the last season with the time travel and multiverse theme shows that the script writers are abreast on the latest to spintheir plots what will life be like without colson melinda may daisy sky fritz jemma mac yoyo and deke every week after entertaining us for the last 7 seasons well done guys all the best and never say never who knows what extinction level earth disaster will need the rescue of the marvel agents of h e d to bring the team back together again ', ' daredevil was an absolute masterpiece was completely blown away by every aspect of the series the characters were so well developed and the villains were truly captivating the attention to detail in the costumes was remarkable and the dialogues were brilliantly written it safe to say that daredevil is without doubt the finest marvel tv show to date the ideology of daredevil added an extra layer of depth and complexity to the story making it even more thought provoking if you re fan of marvel this series is an absolute must watch prepare to be amazed you will be amazed by actors and actresses performance ', ' this series open lie showed that muslims were thrown out of india whole universal truth is muslims demanded another country for islamic people and india with big heart gave them land almost 33 of total land also there is another slogan used in this series aazadi which is being used against india since years if you snatch someone land and still play victim card then there is nothing else to say and we indians are not going to support any anti indian activities and boycotting this web series boycottmarvel ', ' although the movie put lot of effort in trying to find north and be good it fails miserably pushing to confusing plot where lot of details are left behind the impression had was that there were much more to be explained and they could have used more time to connect all the dots talking about connect the dots this is exactly what disney marvel are trying with their expanded universe but this is exactly where they are also failing movie should be complete on its own shouldn be required to watch other movies or pay for streaming which don pay for long time now and watch number of other tv shows to understand the entire universe or all the references don get me wrong what marvel did on mcu phase 1 and slightly on phase 2 worked everything was connected however you could watch every movie independently and it was fine mcu is going downhill for while now and the car has no break anymore ', ' when stood in the long line up nearly out the door to buy my ticket to see the avengers was hoping to be blown away with the action packed story line the trailers promised was nothing short of blown away as the movie progressed from the main story line plot to the underlying story and other messages that the saw from the story the plot from beginning to end was important all the way through and must not be missed for the viewer to experience all this movie has to offer hope that any other future movie viewers find this movie just as appealing as did highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for n action film that is appropriate for children and can still amuse adults at the same time ', ' the movie is complicated and natasha is perfectionist the story doesn make any sense even captain marvel was better than this in storyline would suggest not to waste your data ', ' only have one question jessica have you ever tried ear plug ', ' just watched the movie midnight premiere here in germany so here are my first impressions the woke advertising campaign has little to do with the final film found brie larson offending but don find captain marvel offending generic plot there are much better alien invasion flicks out there vfx sfx are splendid but that a basic requirement for marvel movie the concept of female superman is as absurd as the concept of male superman did you dislike the scene in dc justice league where superman flew around carrying row house if so you will find captain marvel to be camp culture screwball comedy that will make every superman movie every produced look sane sober see that superheros per se are an absurd concept but there has to be limit good pacing never had the feelings of oh m sick of that scene because it is so slow and adds nothing to the plot or oh this was to fast for me to follow the plot edit after having read many other reviews m surprised so many people seem to disagree on this point have they really seen the movie pacing was really good as 90s kid can just say what saw heard and felt was not like the 1990s but more like the work of screenwriter who did serendipity trip through wikipedia 90s portal solid camera work it good to see there are still people left in mainstream hollywood who can do their job without inducing nausea in their audience too many cgi sets and yes you can spot them quite easily this does not contradict the fact that this movie vfx is splendid really like the props and costumes can wait to see my gf in the captain marvel cosplay she working on for the upcoming leipzig book fair the mcu in general is increasingly suffering from franchise wear in hindsight many fans might actually want to consider this movie as the genre jumping the shark moment but personally think thor ragnarok already did that job back in 2017 conclusion 5 10 one extra star for the cat 6 10 but that the absolute maximum rating you can give this movie without having an agenda 7 10 or more is fanboy palavering 3 10 or less is hater rage because seriously think of it if you rate this movie 10 10 then what verdict would you give to the avengers films or the dark knight trilogy or the godfather movies 25 10 and if you rate this movie 1 10 what your verdict on movies like sharknado 25 10 btw m really looking forward to see captain marvel review section in few months because by then the honeymoon period in which everything is great and the weaknesses are widely ignored by joyful fans will have worn off and the haters will have shifted their attention to hollywood next sjw project and yes of course captain marvel is an sjw product but it still an ok movie that far from being unwatchable like the all female ghostbusters from 2016 was and it doesn break the mcu canon like the hyper diverse star trek discovery broke star trek 50 year old canon so if you are marvel fan there is no reason not to have fun with captain marvel however if marvel stuff isn your cup of tea you might want to consider watching alita battle angel instead as cameron movie is better made and features female superhero too and if you don like superhero movies at all you might want to stay at home ', ' after 4 years worth of building the mcu piece by piece the avengers is able to satisfy longtime fans as well as newcomers the movie starts off by showing us the tesseract an energy cube with unlimited power the main threat to this movie is thor brother loki who gains access to the tesseract loki wants to use the tesseract to enslave and rule over the human race director of shield nick fury assembles team to stop him the team consists of iron man black widow captain america thor hulk and hawkeye the one problem have with this movie is the way they underutilized jeremy renners character hawkeye he was mind controlled for nearly the whole movie and it just felt lazy almost like they didn know what to do with him overall great movie and great start to the avengers franchise and the mcu as whole ', ' as marvel fan and middle eastern person was hoping this show would be atleast ok to watch but its just horrible terrible acting horrible story ', ' lot of action but not one of the best marvel movies scarlett is beautiful as always good story to understand black widow more for the good marvel movies ', ' m not really the target audience being little bit old but this is fun romp through teenagerhood the lead characters are smart and funny and kamala is cute and fairly typically 16 what great about this show is how it is incorporating modern tech in delightfully innovative and colourful way and the colours and cinematography on this show are outstanding as for those saying it too woke it seems fairly accurate portrait of modern 21st century city certainly it reflects what see in my city guess if you live in white enclave you don look at the beauty and diversity around you much it fun and bright and cheerful watch it and enjoy ', ' the team is finally together will admit that going into this film wasn sure that loki was the correct choice for an antagonist but he astoundingly does an amazing job mean he was the bad guy in the first thor and for him to be the carry over villain in the avengers seemed like it would be stale but he does fantastic job will admit that felt like the crew sort of come together with little more ease than thought they would m not sure that the death of someone would have been enough to have them all come together in this way but clearly m wrong because that exactly what happened fantastic movie will definitely watch again ', ' m very mixed about this show went into it expecting to dislike it came out of the pilot optimistic and by the end couldn stand it it does start really great have to give the first 2 episodes props nice but nickelodeon feeling teen school life sitcom that worked because of how likable kamala and bruno are and the cool scott pilgrim esque style however it quickly goes from being mostly inoffensive to the broader mcu to being confusing mess it tries to take itself seriously with boring confusing plot and awfully constructed villains it feels like low budget cw show the actions of kamran najma and the dodc make no sense the dimensional travel and noor stuff are so confusing that don understand why they wouldn have just used her comic origin characters like waleed are there to exposition dump for story that is so ridiculous yet all the characters just accept what is going on and expect the audience to do the same still must give credit where credit is due kamala and all her family and friends are really likable the music is great new jersey feels so lively and when it not just big cheap cgi fest the show is very stylistic there a humble story about family and finding yourself here but it smothered beneath hectic plot there too much going on kamala has 3 love interests within 6 episode show and they all go nowhere bruno story arc is set up and then he sidelined for half the show nakia has heavy presence at first then does nothing whole plot lines feel overlooked or not fleshed out it makes the show feel rushed and the kiddy nature of the show isn an excuse for its quality kids already like the mcu at quality level acceptable for all ages it especially not excusable when the show grounds itself in universe that it actively contradicts the time travel logic of it just feels like they decided where kamala was gonna end up first for her crossover with captain marvel and then backpedaled making stuff up just to get from to as result we get what think is genuinely one of the worst main antagonists of marvel project ever among other issues kamala hero journey where through her family she discovers the superhero within her both literally and figuratively is the best part of the show however that actual journey is one that makes me really not want season 2 regardless still wish the best for this character going forward in the universe she could bring some really needed heart to the marvels ', ' this show is so bad that would rather watch hanna montana that watch this ever again it is really bad in the last episode lady cop says don use letal round want the kid alive 5 minutes later cops start shooting the kid with letal rounds don waste your time with this cw show ', ' this movie easily did even more than expected it to do and expected lot c am big avengers fan loved the recent captain america iron man and hulk movies and think joss whedon is maybe my favourite recent writer and director of anyone else out there ve been waiting for this movie since sam jackson character from the government agency said stark knows he not the only superhero in his world the avenger initiative is action packed fun just superbly entertaining and well done movie never would have believed it could be possible to put all of these characters in the same movie and do them all justice at least not unless the movie was more than three or four hours long what fantastic fun movie this is highly recommend it and already want to see it again ', ' dont know why it has high rating there nothing sweet about this other than in daredevil here there are no sweet action scenes the story is not that interesting its an average for me ', ' 69 all that build up from all those already very big movies was about worth it as this is quite an accomplishment to not only bring together all those superheroes but also to give them each an pretty equal share of screen time and importance the script works well despite the plot being very big budget hollywood and it has some nice funny touches here and there the final battle in new york where was spider man when all this was going on is very well developed that sticks to the equal share of each character very well and gives good portion of what the audience want to see action mayhem this is without doubt one of the better superhero movies ever and one of the best marvel movies to date roll on the next mammoth ', ' the only thing remotely liked was the retro style the cat and the avengers end game clip that it ', ' am nothing more than sad and disappointed because we need more of this this show is gift that has been taken from us we only borrowed it nothing more the story of matt murdock should live on but from what we got already it has been pleasure to have this in my experience and im sure nothing could be like it never again ', ' almighty please give back my daredevil and command the damned netflix make more daredevils ', ' the writing is pretty sad and predictable which makes it hard to watch several episodes together ', ' captain marvel the favorite of many that there is only one exclusive contest for her and not for other avengers and that in their first convention and they are not made one for tony widow and captain how did captain marvel gain so much popularity if her only achievement was destroying ship and fighting thanos for 5 minutes where is that popularity for wanda that she was the only one who managed to corner thanos to the point of sacrificing her army to save himself from her another thing is grut the guardians of the galaxy did not go to earth when grut was an adult therefore nobody from earth knows adult grut but even so there are shirts with that appearance how can that be and understand that khamala origin is different because of the issue of not knowing anything about the inhumans in the ucm but changing the character powers seems absurd to me superhero capable of changing her physical form became teenager capable of casting spells with the mind thanks to magic bracelet now we will see her jump from platform to platform like dr strange ', ' this is the worst marvel movie ever seen didn even finish it only watched first 45 minutes it is like joke was very disappointed because one my favorite movie series becoming worst maybe they targeted this movie for teens but it can good even for child or if they targeted this for indian audience have seen much better bollywood and tamil movies than this one the dc movies getting better with there every new move while the marvel getting worst with there every new movie the reason is dc listen to their audience best example is zack snyder justice league they make movies for audience ', ' let me start by saying daredevil season 1 was so great it was the reason got netflix daredevil season 2 for me was ok really liked the punisher but didn feel much for the main plot but wow season 3 would probably get my memory erased to relive this masterpiece again every character which is introduced has proper backstory you actually care about each and every persons motives you get to choose who you like love great villians and this show delivers not one but two wilson fisk from season 1 itself was very impressive and season 3 he delivers an exemplary performance but the person who stole the show was bullseye his character development was amazing and the action scenes were phenomenal usually shows have plot holes directors don really care to fill them up but this show had no plot holes it was really amazing they went for bit unexpected ending which really liked usually multiple villains ruin movies and shows but this they did it so well lol this is probably how been afflecks daredevil movie should have been must watch ', ' its for kids at least think it is has lots of bad acting and the special effects are really bad and the story is just really cringe this is based on the first episode and with that being the pilot to get you interested well it failed miserably ', ' whether it the subject of very good tv series the montage or the actors the very good series manages to attract itself you feel as if you are there while watching ', ' season finale released today and as whole this series is just more hum drum marvel garbage don care to talk much about this show so ll make this quick terrible writing cringe dialogue boring characters and while most of the time praise marvel disney on production value cgi and cinematography cannot do so here it all felt very low budget and half done the cgi was at times downright atrocious and half baked when compared to the other mcu shows it was terrible the depiction of different culture not represented in the mcu before while was refreshing change shortly began feeling forced like it was just check off on disney list of diversity the only thing that really held up in this series was the seasson premiere and episode 105 that episode actually featured competent writing with great acting and interesting backstory why they couldn have done this with the series as whole is beyond me kamala khan is an interesting enough character but due to poor writing and think bit over acting on the actresses part iman vellani just made me not care for her m willing to give the young actress the benefit of the doubt as have never seen her in anything before and perhaps she was directed this way overtime maybe she can grow as the character and with some competent writers she could develop into something better in the end this show just further proves to me how out of touch marvel disney has become hopefully the next mcu series is superior and better made imdb 3 10 letterboxd 2 5 watched on disney ', ' good story and execution with awesome performance by both the protagonist but again marvel show lacks good villian in this show also and some things are stretched too long like the family drama ', ' despite many flaws overall the punisher is an enjoyable show worth watching the key reasons why the punisher wont meet many marvel fans expectations is the very core of its plot many fans would have hoped for more of frank castle vs the criminals of new york but instead are shown details of army life and the shoddy us justice system as result the first half of the season is bit of drag and its likely less patient viewers will never see the end however those of us who continued will be treated to riveting action phenomenal acting and engaging plot developments ultimately its the punishers fast paced 2nd half of the season and satisfying conclusion which is why fans are eagerly awaiting season 2 and have left positive reviews on imdb ', ' m long time marvel fan read and collected marvel comics 20 years before they started making marvel studios films have watched all movies and series that they have made so far ve enjoyed most of them and skipped nothing this series however was so boring that just stopped watching the reason is that it doesn have anything interesting the main character is boring nice girl and the villains are even more boring the character development has no edge and the fight scenes are just big mess nothing carries the series hopefully this is not where marvel is taking its universe in future there is so many characters in the marvel comics that are much more interesting ', ' avengers all right avengers assemble if you insist is really quite extraordinarily good it pretty much everything that fun about superhero comics translated directly onto the screen was hoping for as much from joss whedon and he delivered like serenity and the buffy season 5 finale it extremely well structured so that everyone gets more than one moment to shine in both dialogue and action scenes can think of another action movie that has so many characters and is so well balanced between them all and all the different combinations of arguments and team ups between them it also extremely funny but mostly not in that trademark joss whedon buffyspeak way that some very wrong people find precious and annoying it has better tony stark dialogue than either iron man movie having said that the funniest gags are visual ones that involve the hulk often complain that superhero films weakest parts tend to be their climactic action sequences the stakes are raised and believability is strained well for once we have superhero film whose best action scene comes at the end it one of the best sustained action finales since the matrix and much better directed than the incomprehensible shots of the dark knight it constantly spectacular and contains countless satisfying moments in both action and dialogue most of which also happen to be very funny but the best single scene in the whole film isn an action scene standard phrase joss whedon has used in promotional interviews is wanted to figure out why all these different characters should even be in the same room as each other well that scene where they are all in the same room as each other turned out to be the film absolute highlight scenes like that are what ll look forward to on subsequent viewings there have been lots of action films that ve enjoyed at the cinema for their sheer spectacle but then have felt little desire to re watch because that they didn have much else going for them avatar comes to mind but this isn one of them the film plot isn exactly intricate it extremely tightly focused around the macguffin from thor and captain america however this isn a bad thing in film of this scale ensuring the characterisation and action is satisfying is an ambitious balancing act as it is without adding complex twisty turny plot to the mix as well the film doesn carry any sort of larger real world message it really just movie about these specific characters about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other but as far as movies about guys in silly costumes beating the living daylights out of each other go well it hard to imagine how they could get much better ', ' did not live up to my expectations at all for movie with such hype it was very long and the picture was very dark too many overly dramatic lines and the buildup music lasted for practically the whole movie usually love superhero movies but this one was letdown don know why it got such great ratings the iron man thor hulk and captain america movies were more enjoyable on their own thought it would be great to see all these heroes come together but think it really just lead to so many main characters that the audience didn get chance to understand any of them individually special effects were great don get me wrong and the 3d was cool but that wasn enough to save the movie storyline was too stretched out underwhelming opening the movie didn evoke my emotions wasn scared sad excited relieved when should have been bunch of characters that are interesting on their own plus special effects does not equal great movie overall m disappointed ', ' think that this is the best movie of marvel works acting visual effects the plot well about plot there are some exaggerated things the music literally love this film ', ' this is one movie that went into with really low standards but was sadly still disappointed there no story line terrible script annoying characters and pointless endless hoards of enemies who what to kill everyone like usual for some reason the special effects are alright but that to be expected as they have the budget for it but to be honest the only thing that kept me watching this major disappointment was scarlett johansson in that tight costume that it that simply not enough for huge blockbuster that was supposed to unite all of these massive superhero movies of late don waste your time with this movie will just add that this movie isn as bad as captain america or thor both of which walked out of ', ' the marvels is cinematic catastrophe that manages to obliterate any lingering shreds of excitement and enthusiasm one might have had for superhero movies from the mind numbingly predictable plot to the cringe worthy dialogue this film is masterclass in how not to make superhero epic the characters who are supposed to be larger than life superheroes come across as cardboard cutouts reciting lines from poorly written high school play the lackluster performances from the cast only serve to underscore the shallowness of the script it as if the actors themselves couldn muster any genuine interest in the drivel they were being forced to deliver the special effects which should be the saving grace of any superhero flick are astonishingly subpar the cgi looks like it was pulled from the archives of forgotten 90s video game leaving audiences more likely to cringe than gasp in awe the action sequences are so poorly choreographed that they resemble chaotic mess of pixels rather than the epic battles promised in the trailers the film attempts at humor fall painfully flat with jokes that seem to have been recycled from worn out joke book the audience instead of laughing was left in an awkward silence that spoke volumes about the movie failure to connect on any emotional level the marvels shamelessly borrows elements from successful superhero franchises without adding anything innovative or compelling of its own it a shameless cash grab that preys on the popularity of the genre without bringing anything new to the table in the end this film is forgettable 1h45m slog that leaves you questioning why you ever thought watching superheroes on the big screen could be an enjoyable experience save your money and avoid this cinematic disaster at all costs ', ' marvel is on its way to cater to even younger people and sadly can see the bottom next you will have coco melon style marvel shows for toddlers mrs marvel is silly childish uninteresting show about well stopped watching after 3 episodes because couldn stand it think there will be mervel universe will not be part of the marvel kids universe ', ' the avengers superhero symphony that had me fist pumping like marvel fanatic the ensemble cast from robert downey jr snarky tony stark to scarlett johansson kick ass black widow is powerhouse of charisma and chemistry each hero shining in their own right the film editing is whirlwind of action seamlessly interweaving larger than life battles with character driven moments that give the narrative heart strengths the seamless blending of individual hero stories into cohesive team dynamic superhero jigsaw puzzle that fits together flawlessly weaknesses occasionally the plot might hover on the edge of over the top but hey it a superhero extravaganza and we love it that way the music alan silvestri score is the pulse of heroism swelling with each iconic entrance and saving the world crescendo cinematography captures the grandeur of the marvel universe from the soaring heights of stark tower to the depths of loki mischief the message celebration of teamwork diversity and the idea that even the most disparate heroes can come together for the greater good 8 10 is superhero salute to its exhilarating entertainment film that not only assembles earth mightiest heroes but also assembles solid spot in the pantheon of superhero epics ', ' teen drama with terrible stereotype for south asian population colours bollywood dance songs worried parents marriage dramas spicy curries are just exaggerated western imagination of south asian culture ', ' quite enjoyed this movie but the whole woke casting character thing is becoming bit cliched and tiresome admittedly is was less in your face than lot of other garbage we have been subjected to lately but still ', ' love these types of shows daredevil was amazing once watched the first two episodes was hooked charlie cox plays the character perfectly wilson risk is great villain didn love the hand as much but loved fisk in season 1 2 and 3 bullseye was amazing performance he played the perfect character couldn even tell he was acting at points season 1 was great but season 3 was something else season 3 was perfect watched it in 3 days it was so good it left me at cliffhanger at the end of each episode just had to keep watching season 2 wasn my favorite but it wasn bad loved the punisher in it john played the character so well didn love the hand but besides that season 2 was good ', ' got bored after 30 min the story line is bad and the acting of the main character is bad too waist of 19 dollars ', ' the series so far has been showing other culture and religion in s in the mcu lense my family love the series and it great the fighiting scene is ok on the 3rd episode but understandable since she does not have martial art background but would love to see what next exploring new world of the folklore is awesome am trying not to spoil so much better just watch just wanna see more connection to other superheroe in mcu ', ' it rather funny that motion picture producers take some things literally mean black widows aren supposed to be black they are russian girls after all disney diversity standards have ruined yet another movie ', ' weak in my opinion this film should have been released much earlier right now this movie does absolutely nothing for us except for one character it sad because showing us other events would have turned out better and this is how nick fury eye turned out ', ' the is just so cringe and fails in lot of areas the writing is just bad but while looking at the other reviews it has done good job catching pakistani ideals if that is the right word there are some great ideas and cool ways they used to tell what is happening but again the writing is just so cringe childish maybe if was younger than 14 would at lest not get driving away from the stupidity in this but im in my 20s having watched the first iron man movie in my early teens so this is not good enough for the audience this is made for for this universe of multiple movies but this is my own option if you think differently that is fine am not trying to tell anyone they are wrong just putting my own thoughts out there ', ' all of your favorite superheroes together in one movie it every geeks dream and it must definitely pays off this action packed thrill ride never stops for air and has such great actors all together in one movie the craziness starts when thor brother wants to take over earth and shield enlists the help of an elite team of superheroes called the avengers iron man hulk black widow thor hawkeye and captain america with all these differing personalities comes battle of egos resulting in many battle royals which is awesome to see it all leads to one of the most thrilling endings of all time awesomeness in its purest form ', ' the story is okay but the movie is horrible it like watching fast and furious movie totally ridiculous ', ' hey remember thor 2 dark world 272 million dollar movie where nothing much happened bland filler for one infinity stone and loki getting away from thor still made 644 million and nobody cared anymore that heimdall was raceswapped in the last movie because the actor did fine job the marvels was made on the same amount of money and cant even break even and feels even more bland than eating boiled potatostarch not cornstarch that has actual corn flavor boiled potato starch the poor mans glue to tie stuff together that is this movie kamala khan feels downgraded from her own tv series monica rambeau is just there because early 80s comics fifth wheel that does nothing beyond having the power to fix dimensional plot hole in the end the villain is forgettable nick fury retired to play starfield bugs and all didn even tell anyone about tarnax skrull refugee planet the only thing that could have saved this movie was going all the way into turning captain marvel into villain since her gunho path of destruction keeps making things worse around the galaxy what has marvel cinematic univers actually gain from this what phase 5 story narrative did it run nothing only subtractions and fails write better stories ', ' loved it and met all expectations after two year theatrical absence great stand alone movie with some winter soldier and civil war vibes which makes sense almost expected dominic torreto to show up with how many times family was mentioned stand out performance of the movie has to be florence looking forward to the new widow going forward ', ' it is no mistaking that if you love the blood and guts of action movies this may not be for you it a fun fast paced whirlwind of great movie yes said great anyone who liked ms marvel will like it m not including spoilers but will tell you that barbara streisand cover of song is great surprise the team up of brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani is fantastic they make great team you have to admit that vellani steals every scene she in ofcourse would rather see movie like this than something that has unnecessary gory violence it is sci fi comic book adventure and for me it a winner the marvels is worth seeing ', ' was anxious to see jessica jones when it was announced but after four episodes took it off my watch list jessica is mess it is good to see and liked the idea of super hero having flaws however flaws is one thing but being an irrational overbearing unintelligent promiscuous drunk is bit too much she is so obnoxious it is difficult to believe that pam her friend and jeri her lawyer employer would put up with her and continue to help her this show is simply annoying found myself fast forwarding through most of it david tennant whom enjoyed in broadchurch is wasted carrie moss as usual is very good the lead krysten ritter is not that good she seems to think screaming and moaning are acting have seen her do better work so the fault may lie with the writing or the direction regardless it is very disappointing and not worth the time to watch ', ' it feels like it written by kids for kids it not positive representation of pakistani peoples and their culture it poorly scripted and performed it got an overall tacky feelings to it didn want to write review until watched every episode now that ve done that can say remained hopeful and my fandom for marvel and the mcu was not rewarded the cgi was pathetic marvel is starting to become as poorly constructed as the dceu ', ' nothing to watch here young boy is involved in an accident gets super powers and beats up bad people the story is filled is clich the writing is terrible there is no storyline or anything people appear at am not even sure why some of the characters exist the only thing that interested me was that while all super heroes wear their mask in such way that their eyes are exposed daredevil wears his mask the other way around exposing his chin but that novelty wears off quite quickly and then there is nothing else of interest in the series the people rating it highly are either fake accounts or daredevil fans this series is made for 12 year old although the violence is not age appropriate if adults are actually viewing this series and liking this despair at mankind no wonder the top 1 are getting richer ', ' solid and awesome start for marvel daredevil the show is gloomier and grittier than other marvel shows although it is connected to the marvel universe it has its own little spot in hell kitchen separate from the other superhero settings matthew murdoch has an impossible task fighting poverty crime drugs and the very human evil that plagues common downtrodden citizens it shows despair hopelessness and one crime fighter being outnumbered what like about the daredevil character is that although he has some superpowers enhanced situational awareness to point he can hear someones heartbeat he relies most on his courage and will power it is the discipline and complete devotion to justice to try to make difference which makes it interesting this is portrayed well in the show to take out ten guys in fight it actually takes an effort you sometimes take beating you bleed you bruise you get beaten down but you must get up charlie cox puts solid performance am looking forward how the character develops in the second season oh and not to forget vincent onofrio as kingpin menacing and strong presence he has in every scene he can sure play those roles well an excellent choice ', ' the entire show from the ground up is just pandering nonsense love that we have heroes of different cultures systems and genetics in the market my biggest beef is how hollywood just forces it down everyone throats in such an aggressive and eyeroll manner constantly calling attention to character beliefs race gender lifestyle what not just gets so belittling and demarginalizing not only to them but to the viewers why not just make shows about people and the events in their lives without all the force feeding ', ' literally the only good thing about this show is the positive muslim representation it might just be marvel fatigue but most of the shows and movies they have been putting out have had mediocre writing at best at least to me ', ' was very excited to see this movie and ended up being equally disappointed brie larson acting was terrible the forced feminism and not so subtle political agenda also really contributed to my poor opinion of this movie boo ', ' don get me wrong really like the black widow character but this movie was meh for me m always about the journey of the movie if the journey the main character or characters go on then m not as interested and this was sadly the case the action set pieces are decent but nothing that really blew me away that the thing about this movie for me it just kind of forgettable ', ' had no idea this show was coming and put it on on whim and m glad did it exactly what it sounds like exactly what you imagine it is but better and awesome definitely recommend best cartoon ve seen in while and ve seen some good ones recently ', ' this movie was terrible disappointment nothing like the winter soldier or thor it was disaster the plot did not make sense fighting scenes with no sense feel sorry for the cast who was given such poor material the direction was awful black widow deserved better wish the russo brothers worked on it but unfortunately they did not personally watched it jsut cause m big marvel fan and like most them wanted to see this movie and judge it for myself so even if it does well at the box office it doesn mean the movie was good terrible save your money and don go if you can ', ' not much daredevil someone lost plot literally clue was in the name boys and girls ', ' had much higher expectations from the show but it looks like aimed at kids if was 5 10 year old girl then maybe but it is for sure not for me the writing is very weak the super powers are completely changed from the books it is more of high school drama rather than what you expect from marvel series ', ' the first season surprised with its dark setting drunk unwilling hero very evil villain and nice side story love interest nice setup for luke cage thought season 1 was really good come season 2 with much anticipation what load of badness don know why there had to be this overbearing female director script actor thing but it messed up everything m not against feminism etc but we re talking story telling here not manifest for women can do these things too which know already please stop being so preoccupied with that please hope the producers choose the best suited person for the job direction script actor not based on gender that gender equality back to the script for season 2 it just plain boring no real point only sidequests it started interesting with the origins of jessica but derailed quickly the jeri story could have been left out completely the trish addiction story is contrived the mother daughter story feels like nonsense beside the plotholes there is no real tension no villiain the last 6 episodes were real pain to watch but really wanted it to become better alas the ending suits the season sadly no seperate stars per season idea imdb s1 7 stars s2 1 star ', ' like some of the comments posted was very excited about daredevil when it came out but really does it need to be that violent it verges on psychopathic the characters are great and the plots have so much potential but take out the violence and the show is half the original length my kids love super heroes just wish that there were good characters good stories and plots without the mindless gratuitous violence that is getting so prevalent the cinematography and style of the show is top notch the acting is great it is not over the top unlike some of the fight scenes the first big fight scene has daredevil throw flashlight at container door which ricochets off its surface to hit one of the bad guys he didn know if the door angle was right purleese but the characters are strong and well played please can the makers of these shows play down the violence and play up the plot some more give us something worthwhile and not just scenes stolen from fightclub ', ' just terrible ll give anything marvel chance and have liked near enough everything from them but couldn get through 15 minutes of this show pace was terrible plot uninteresting just bland is ms marvel show meant to be this boring ', ' this was really fun frances pugh was supposed to carry the movie as she is in the new hawkeye series this year it was fun to see one of the human superheros in action no special powers it is like jason bourne which is great m glad we didn spend time watching her be tortured as child very exciting and heartwarming at the same time no avenger cameos to detract from the film it fun and different ', ' is movie is fantastic but its the side characters that make it goose fury talos lawson and rambeau all help captain marvel find her humanity ', ' how do you take silver age villain remove all interesting aspects history and shove him off into the sunset in 90 minutes make it the opposite of what he is suppose to be ', ' poor writing cannot extend story that could have been done in one hour subplots of the lawyer and the other pi were irrelevant and painfully boring marvel tried to create series based on drabness and succeeded yawn ', ' as kid was an avid marvel comic reader this series is pretty much what had expected except everything is amped up the violence is especially amped up it excessive gory and at times adds little to the story the plot is thin and the writing incredibly immature the first season could have made reasonable 90 minute movie but as tv series it is slow repetitive and unrewarding the dialogue often tells us nothing about the storyline and seems to be used to simply waste time so basically it 25 gory violence 30 mundane dialogue 2 comedy thanks to foggy and the rest is just plain tedious after episode 4 of the second season d had enough and vowed never to waste any more time on this ', ' all can say is am stunned that this terrible movie has been given rating above 2 or 3 by anyone and to read this film grossed over 600mm makes me lack faith in the movie public the avengers has virtually no character development or plot it basically is non stop chase scenes and things exploding with an extreme amount of loud noise don think there were more than several quiet dialog times the entire movie kept thinking that the movie would settle down and get to meaningful story but it did not happen even was watching it in 3d but that did not help if one wants to go see continual actions stunts and things exploding then this is the movie for you am dismayed that so many people considered seeing this movie based on the revenues but then again was one of the victims too ', ' this is the perfect movie to watch when you re on long flight jet lagged and just need something to watch that halfway entertaining but require no brain function if you fall asleep you can wake up and still understand the basic plot of the movie this embodies what black widow is the acting fine the actions decent does bw survive an ungodly amount of falls and explosions yes do you learn anything about black widows backstory not really oh but you learn how she got her vest from infinity war which is cool guess the biggest problem with this movie is it came out like 5 or 6 years too late can stress how average this movie is don think too hard enjoy your 2 hours and don worry about rewatching it ', ' when loki steals the tesseract from shield headquarters and kidnaps clint barton and erik selvig by mind controlling them through his scepter nick fury assembles the avengers team tony stark steve rogers natasha romanoff and bruce banner later thor too joins the team while arriving on earth to search for loki and the tesseract rest of the film is how the avengers stop loki first let me talk about the negatives which makes this film for me underwhelming and overrated the movie runs in slow pace in teamup film expect the teamup within 30 40 minutes but in this the whole team do not cooperate with each other until the last hour and third is joss whedon direction is amateurish and mostly feels like tv show as he is tv show director but all these issues forget when the spectacular finale comes where the avengers assemble and work like team each and every member have their heroic moments in the battle the cast is phenomenal and loki is very intimidating villain on the whole forget the issues with the avengers when see the new york battle ', ' when started watching jessica jones felt bit out of place as didn know much about the character and the alias series the pilot has slow pace and pretty much no action and then it hit me this is not your generic action driven super hero show it is detective story that flirts bit with the noir movies of old with troubled protagonist in world where she can tell who to trust from who has been tainted by the main antagonist jessica is your super powered private investigator that has been through lot and done lot of things good and bad she thinks she has failed herself due to events in her past jones drinks lot and doesn care what others think of her and krysten ritter shows that very well jessica jones is strong character literally and figuratively that can take care of herself and of those she cares by flashbacks bit of her past is shown and it helps understand how and why she got where she is right now kilgrave the main antagonist is set in very clever way during the first 2 3 episodes by showing not the character itself but what he is capable of and the effect he has left on those he crossed paths with he lingers as presence that haunts jones and the others and when he is shown david tennant plays him in very charming and magnetic way which makes you feel disgusting as person once you realize the things kilgrave has done and here is one drawbacks from the series the villain is never fully explored showing only hint about his past having an episode fully focused on him would ve fleshed out the character making it even better and probably one of the best villains showed by marvel in their movies or series when it comes to supporting characters the series is mixed bag with very interesting ones like pam luke cage and malcom and to others that aren really necessary to the plot overall like robyn simpson and the lawyers the shows spends lot of time with the later characters they are unidimensional and creates sub plots that were never really interesting some of those scenes really drags the show and it could ve done so much better without them the relationship of jones and these characters are good the dialog can be bit iffy sometimes but the actors do the best they can with what they have succeeding in showing their connection with the protagonist but here is where the show falls apart the last third of the season it feels completely unnecessary the cat and mouse game that jessica and kilgrave play is dragged to an extent that hurts the show when the tables are turned for the fourth time you aren really invested anymore and decisions made by most of the characters seem out of place which leads to an underwhelming finale overall the first season of jessica jones is decent with strong female lead which is lacking in movies and series an interesting but underdeveloped villain and not having the focus in the right characters jessica jones shows potential to be an amazing series that needs bit of polishing here and there ', ' lots of cgi poor story unengaging characters all adds up to non event ', ' what would you do if the people who you trust the most betray you and kill your family maybe you will wait for the cops and the lawyers to put them on prison but frank castle the punisher as an ex special forces and ex convict do not trust in the justice system and he shows us that sometimes there is thin line between justice and vengeance and sometimes they are the same ironically this web television series balance pretty well the graphic violence with the moral and ethical issue of taking justice by your own hand this follow the same argument of daredevil of course this is spin off however here the main character is an antihero so it is expected too much blood really too much but what guess is more valuable of the punisher is that at some point makes you wonder if we are monsters or humans because each character is not totally good or totally mean while they take care of the loved ones they show that is frightening what humans are often capable of by the way at the end of the punisher frank finds the answer to that question what are you waiting to find it it is not fast paced as other action movies or tv shows but have lot of action scenes am sure you will enjoy it ', ' series of marvel documentaries sign me up is what initially thought but few episodes in couldn help but feel that marvel 616 main purpose is to sell marvel merchandise and propagandize recent titles only the episode on the japanese spiderman tv series struck true documentary tone and loved learning about how that series came about the other episodes strike classic tv paid programming tone of commercials masquerading as content ', ' it lost my interest when the story never really picked up there narrative may have been good but we were honestly looking for more action ', ' season 3 review and final thoughts on the show ve finally finished the show ve praised so much already and season 3 did not disappoint this season takes matt at his lowest point where he feels like he lost himself and it gives him the most satisfying redemption thinkable it peak superhero storytelling seeing him try to rebuild himself physically and emotionally accepting that he is daredevil but he is also matt murdock and he needs his friends to be who he always has been it so impressive how they implement his religion and struggle with faith into the story it is done so carefully and is beautifully woven into his character arc it handles the matter better than lot of religion based storytelling shows ultimately the show has validified daredevil as my all time favorite hero despite knowing nothing about him before watching there is something so special about his character he learns how to become man without fear but doesn lose himself or his purpose but this isn just show with an amazing hero protagonist it also has amazing villains kingpin is back in full force and must say specifically in this season he is easily the most mind blowing and impressive villain ve seen in anything of the genre every second he is on screen is amazing he so calculated and the acting only makes it so much better along with him is the new addition of bullseye aka agent poindexter he is such an epically twisted man with so much potential that hope we get to see realized in future marvel projects and then there the supporting cast first off foggy is just as great as always the best best friend character nadeem was pleasant surprise who you can help but feel awful for by the end karen especially was at her best this season her stand alone episode was so powerful love her to death and she needs to return this show culminates in of the best finales ever seeing matt foggy and karen back together is the most wholesome thing and matt final confrontation with fisk is so powerful and genuinely inspirational between the acting and the score it is genuinely tear jerking every time go back to either one of these scenes so is season 3 better than season 1 d argue maybe so but either way the show as whole is up there with the walking dead as my favorite ever and definitely better as whole too it a masterclass in its genre that uses the superhero concept to make story way more powerful than it has any right to be m so happy to have daredevil and kingpin return to the mcu and both excited and cautiously hopeful about the continuation show daredevil born again still don think they ll ever be able to live up to what they did here so yeah watch daredevil ', ' full of stereotypes woke and trying to push an agenda nothing in this show is interesting plot and development of the show is really boring the main actress ould be great in comedy but not as ms marvel it feels like am watching kids show even worse than iron fist obviously aimed to get the money from new target audience which it does not hide really awkward to watch ', ' ms marvel is very enjoyable show the first few episodes focused in on fun high school tone with clever visuals that popped and likeable characters who were mostly well portrayed by their respective actors the second half of the show noticeably strays from this tone but in way that made narrative sense and didn feel forced my biggest criticism of the show would probably be it struggles in melding the two tones together in it final episode where the stakes feel too extreme for the series the obligatory cameo in the credits was also dissapointing though bound to happen if was choosing show to recommend from the marvel canon would definitely consider this ', ' although marvel pictures have always made curious appointments in regards to their feature film directors the results have been mostly solid if not spectacular thus far certainly didn expect jon faverau to deliver one of the best comic book movies ever iron man if it wasn for dc own billionaire playboy superhero would ve champion iron man as the best flick in the genre yes do rate iron man that highly spider man 1 2 were good but didn exactly capture the essence of peter parker while spider man 3 was huge mess not mark steven johnson mess but mess nonetheless last year motion picture debuts of marvel staples thor and captain america were also very good very faithful to their respective source material joe johnston redeemed himself after misguided attempt at bringing the wolfman back to the silver screen whereas kenneth branaghs shakespeare sensitive proved stroke of genius in fitting thor into marvel motion picture universe to be honest even enjoyed 2008 the incredible hulk after ang lee damn near killed the franchise even though marvel pictures has proved time and again to make the right decisions when producing movie on its own the hiring of joss whedon seemed like an odd choice of course joss whedon is the genius behind tv cult hits like buffy angel and firefly but his only foray into directing was 2005 serenity managing all those superstar egos handling multiple character arcs dealing with several multimillion dollar franchises and making everyone happy from top brass executive down to the hardcore fanboys to be honest wouldn have entrusted him with fraction of the 200 million plus budget for the avengers thus far only two directors have managed to pull off the impossible and accomodated several superheroes in single movie bryan singer men x2 and matthew vaughn men first class while brett ratner ruined men 3 with his unfocused direction at first thought joss whedon would do an even more terrible job than the latter considering that ratner had more filmmaking experience than whedon at the time of filming x3 but nothing could be further from the truth joss whedon is the master with captial let me say it out loud joss whedon is comic book movie god unlike ratner he actually cares about the characters and their development throughout the movie you think tony stark would just waltz through the movie and roll over every other character you are wrong though robert downey jr is in top form as he always is when he dons the iron man suit the other characters are far from underdeveloped and don crumble under the pressure of his larger than life persona if anything it the hulk that absolutely steals the show that said think we have found the definitive bruce banner mark ruffalo he absolutely owns the role he is the hulk and we finally got the hulk we deserved everybody brings their game and every character gets fair amount of screen time can find any flaw in this movie of course the special effects are spectacular but it the dialogue that won me over really each character in this movie has at least one or two memorable lines not just tony stark when you watch the avengers make sure you listen to the dialogue carefully ve never heard dialogue this witty in any comic movie and ve watched my fair share joss whedon you are the freaking man they said it was impossible to accommodate this many characters in single movie they were wrong from now on everyone will reference this movie whenever multiple larger than life figures are thrown into one supersized extravaganza yeah m slamming the last two transformers flicks guarantee joss whedon would ve done justice to the franchise after watching the avengers everything that bears the name of joss whedon is must see for me now final verdict 10 out of 10 this movie is iron man on steroids go watch that movie ', ' everything just worked perfectly for the avengers my geek heart jumped several times during the movie so many cool and memorable action scenes great comic timing it is just epic in every way the overall story is simple evil guy wants to dominate earth but it doesn matter because it still carries depth due to the previous movies which are tied together seamlessly with this one the chemistry between the actors are perfect and skeptics don worry caps suit is not bad looking at all and there is perfectly fine explanation for why it does not look as high tech shiny as the rest of the avengers but for that one you need to watch the movie experiences like this is why cinema is still the best place to watch epic action movies and the avengers is nothing but epic ', ' boring and pointless hope they cancel it and pretend it never happened ', ' netflix why so much gayness know there are gay people is netflix creating the new normal ', ' knew disney would start to ruin the marvel franchise and this is the start show has horrible cgi characters are all annoying show is made for tinny boppers who know nothing about the comics or marvel they should just cancel it now and just lock it away as big mistake ', ' yeah sometimes watch new movies not just old tv shows and old movies dvds are nowadays hard to come by and ve had to resort to downloads okay so tah dah black widow big scarlett johansson fan me but to cut long story short was in for an awful letdown absolutely awful okay some major action scenes good okay but these people they sound like two bit hungarian porn stars trying to act in an american film that is oh so off putting don like these characters black widow was good enough yeah but the rest when you make movie the audience must be won over by the main characters most of the cast almost all just couldn give one little damn about hell of fuss about storm in bucket of spilt milk and the sobering thought is that am usually guy waxing lyrical about forgotten films from long ago well eighties nineties this thing fails to impress all that technology bad idea shoots itself in the foot yeah with all the marvels about nowadays don forget to make your effort actually likeable ', ' the movie is about the smartest agents but no wisdom in scripts all can see is that they seemly have super soldier serum power and action without smart plans the villain is so simple and easy to be defeated very disappointed ', ' for you comic book fan boys stick to the comic bookstore this was funny entertaining movie pugh and harbour are outstanding supporting cast look forward to seelng yelena story arc pugh was great perfect for this role ', ' this show fell short in every category it felt like super hero version of lizzie mcguire stale jokes impractical plot and no real risk kept this show from being interesting nothing new here just the same recycled garbage in new package changing her powers and using horrible cgi was mega fail so even visually it was awful there just nothing here no reason to watch it beyond the last episode for the mutant connection but you re not missing anything to the plot of the over all mcu this show could of been 1 episode and had just as much impact watched this with my family and everyone had similar experiences actually the wife and kids gave up on it after episode 3 ', ' was underwhelmed obviously the production value was great as is to be expected with marvel production good cgi beautiful lighting good casting but for what have come to expect from superhero shows the stakes were just too low am not familiar with the source material for this show so don know how true it has stayed to it but this felt unusually vanilla even for disney perhaps the most stimulating element in this show is that it raises the question of religion role in universe where gods are not only are proven to exist but regularly interacts with humans on top of that they aren even part of the abrahamic tradition so get that this is not universe that would have lot of atheists as devotions is no longer matter of faith but does it make sense to worry that an event is haram in such universe universe where purple spaceman can snap half the population out of existence with magic stones that pre dates all earth religions suppose this premise is just asking me to suspend my belief bit more than am willing to do to entertain show that do not find entertaining or maybe am getting too old for superheroes considering the aforementioned facts doubt that anyone in the marvel universe would bother with atheism but would still love to see bit more representation for the atheist community in popular culture with superhero that saves people from religious oppression and cults that would be cool so far the boys probably has the best commentary on religion out of any of the shows they generally do the social commentary thing with bit more finesse and better execution ', ' after the iffy iron fist and the catastrophic the defenders was deeply afraid they would slather the punisher in their hyper liberal sjw crap let me just say couldn have been further from the truth not only are the politics more centered but this is at least as strong of series as jessica jones it is impactful emotional full of depth violent and stirring the actors are all perfect the characters relatable the plot thrilling this is dark series but not without its redemption props to for the support this series shows for the us military and it really did make me think about how our soldiers are treated when they get back home watch this you won regret it ', ' as marvel movie fan knew this was going to be different my fear was it wouldn work and would end up cheesy mess but having seen the first episode the writers have actually created very positive upbeat vibe for ms marvel no doubt it might not appeal to everyone but it is refreshing and somehow does add sprinkle of realism to the fantasy looking forward to the rest of the series ', ' the show has been pretty poor so far reminding me of runaways or d for tweens poor acting from the youngsters aside the writers producers have gone the old disney channel show route things are looking up then bad things happen followed by cutesy cringey resolution definitely created for kids which is fine no problem her new interest looks like he about 30 years old so that seems bit strange maybe he is actually secret agent of shield instead ', ' not worth it cringe and entitlement at its peak boring storyline and forceful comedy made for appeasing certain religious section think not worth the watch and definately not worth the time ', ' this is good show hope it will be 4 season ', ' feel this movie still batter than captain marvel and wonder woman 84 ', ' m sorry like this one captain marvel might be the most controversial film in the whole franchise have some grievances with this one namely lack of any style or originality in the writing or direction but the chemistry between brie larson and samuel jackson helps to make this an enjoyable watch know you probably don agree with me but like this movie so there ', ' this is by far the most boring non entertaining marvel film not counting the last two men films have seen since 2008 this film is low on the redemption factor ', ' where is marvel headed with shows like this please make mature content this is straight garbage what next series about japanese teenage girl or maybe korean teenage girl and how she become superhero too much cringe music moon knight was way better then this garbage ', ' agents of h e d is the best marvel can get story telling action and everything was just perfect felt special connect with the characters and didn want it to end season 4 was the best in my books with the story being absolutely amazing loved it ', ' in fact there is no need to comment on this film and everything done is perfect it should be congratulated that film director and writer the film came up to my expectations totally cast of the film consists of my favorite actor and actress whose name are jeremy renner and scarlett johansson negative thing about film the beginning of the film is bit boring because scenes in the film take place in ship guess which made me bit bored but the scenes which was taking place in city is very fantastic and realistic which made me very excited after watching it immediately examine avengers om imdb in terms of its budget gross and vote saw that its gross is approaching one million dollars and also its rate is 8 7 and absolutely it deserves that the another thing which impresses me is unbelievable scenes they are really really perfect and still have bearing upon this film also the extra terrestrials who are coming other planet is very realistic especially character of hulk is very funny and attractive to sum up but for beginning of the film rest of the film is very great and thanks director and cast for presenting such fantastic film ', ' as usual disney keeps destroying marvel after watching this movie few minutes keep wondering if this is made for children or adults simply don like this mix they keep doing it all the time in all new shows too childish cheap sgi effects the movie is all over the places it feels like they are rushing the movie please go back to men era older marvel movies and do not rush with productions this is just nonsense ll better watch older marvel movies than this there is not much more to say about this movie really nothing left to say don waste your time watch something else better ', ' marvel did really good and long ride there years and years of material giving people good time spending too much time with new friend netflix everything started to loose sense and style ', ' as standalone show really enjoyed it lot the characters were easy to root for there was good mix of action and story and it was interesting learning about pakistani culture unlike some other shows where it feels like they are doing something specifically to appeal to certain demographic the cultural inclusion in the show was just as natural as in the comics even though read only some of the comics in like 2014 remember the characters and they look and act incredibly similar 1 point was taken off though because both her powers and how she got them were way different in the show vs the comics and that was bit of bummer although get why they changed the how and actually kind of like this better just wanted to see her original powers on screen funnily enough like ms marvel far more than captain marvel and hope they can find way to include kamala in cameos in other marvel shows movies although only if it handled the same as in this show it not perfect but honestly what fun refreshing break from other more formulaic marvel content with cool art style fun characters and bingeable story highly recommend it ', ' to me the primary issue with this movie is really how much it just makes anything having to do with nicholas fury colson and shield worse these storylines were terrible and needed to never have happened slj was fine in it he was silly and goofy which is totally in line with the nick fury character wait not it isn and the animation was distrcating they made colson and fury look 30 years younger which was aweful shield place and involvement made little to no sense other than they wanted to get way to have cm tied to the rest of mcu and give her an in to endgame which really creates problems in the first 3 avengers movies jokes in this movie were not funny think laughed maybe once though can recall the joke they produced more eye rolls than anything else but they tried really really hard to be funny which was kind of painful think jackson did all right delivering jokes even if they weren good larson doesn seem to have funny bone in her body speaking of larson she was fairly annoyed best got mean take the dealing with the kid in iron man that tony stark had where yeah he was annoyed with the kid but it was kind of funny larson was dealing with kid whom she wasn supposed to be annoyed with but boy did she seem annoyed mean realize that she wasn supposed to be personable but they kept on giving her snarky lines and she wasn snarky at all now look get that marvel had female problem and they needed to solve it and when they made this movie the fox buyout wasn in sight so they didn have ton of options and maybe in future movies captain marvel will be fine after all the captain america movies wait he wasn funny but those movies were surprisingly good nevermind bad point cm is not great character about the best part about her is her cat chewie wait what happened to chewie could marvel not attain rights to the name from disney oh well maybe disney will fix the character by introducing rogue in order to take danvers out this movie was uninspired poorly acted not well thought out and just bad on the bright side it isn the worst mcu movie out there as some others have suggested ', ' if imdb ignored the reviews from season 1 this show would ve been 9 2 10 love this show epic fight scenes but some episodes are boring my favourite season is season 4 season 1 was not that great if you stop watching after season 1 you would regret it for your entire life binge worthy ', ' black widow oh dear what shame and was so looking forward to this the script was beyond clunky and we just had periods of slow weird dialogue that just rambled whilst the characters scored points of each other and this was meant to be humour these periods were juxtaposed with action sequences that were just cgi fun fests totally unbelievable action the whole movie was total clam jam from start to finish and this artificial one sided gender balanced female empowerment sentiment always result in male bashing with any man in movie being portrayed as an idiot superfluous inferior evil or misogynist they tried this before in that turkey captain marvel that majorly flopped the major and overwhelming problem is natasha romanov has no superhero powers so her on screen presence is limited when you compare her to dr strange there were few redeeming point florence pugh was good but her accent was all over the place from kamchatka to the urals and david harbour as alexie was fabulous screen presence who dominated his scenes and was fully committed to the project despite some dreadful lines overall it a weak 6 out of 10 meaning go and see it but don expect much indeed started to fidget ', ' well that was 2 hours of my life ll never get back corny predictable and unfunny oh and lots of boring slow and monotonous bits seems writing screenplays has suffered viral infection where imagination had been put in lockdown and isolation totally un marvel ous ', ' first of just want to make it clear that this movie is probably the best origin movie in mcu and dont know why exaclty everybody is saying that the plot is rubbish as well as brie performance mean as an origin movie goes it is better than thor wonder woman aquaman and captain amerika and as to brie acting she was marvelous thats all that even though there were some downers with the movie not going to spoil anything but as the whole movie goes it worked and was amazing ', ' the only reason m not giving this 1 is because you would have to be an idiot to not recognize the money effects and time that was put into the movie this wasn done lazily just completely misguided there is no tone or running theme this is nothing more than big screen version of playing with action figures just like you did when you were kid wish could even recommended this for children but it so morally bankrupt you might as well set them in front of popcorn machine and let them watch the butter melt brain numbingly dumb ', ' overall plot is average expected better screenplay from mcu movie acting was good from lead four scarlett johansson left her mark strong in the mcu with this movie the family angle could have been handled better cinematography and vfx are only getting better and better with marvel movies ', ' the avengers is superhero movie there are 5 male superheroes and 1 female superhero none of the characters are developed to remotely human or 3 dimensional level although the film has many moments of witty dialogue and some entertaining action scenes the plot feels as if it was made up in few hours and the villain loki the brother of thor one of the heroes is one of the worst in recent action films if you come to movie wanting nothing but two hours of fighting and explosions this film will exceed your expectations but if you watch films for insights on human nature to see well developed interesting characters and to see carefully devised ingenious plot this film may not be for you however it is fair to say that this is simply an action film which is mindless entertainment and as mindless entertainment this film does succeed and for succeeding at that it earns solid 7 out of 10 stars ', ' if your fan of marvel then this show is for you even if your not really it has everything you could want in sci fi show with each season bringing something different to the table as great as all the marvel movies are and they are great this show really gets to expand on things that two hour movie cannot the relationship between fitz and simmons is just an example of how with more time 13 1 hr episodes you can tell more developed story and never does it feel like it just filler to take up an episode they have so many things they can do because of the world they live in give it shot you won be disappointed ', ' as pakistani was excited for this show but when the first episode streamed it blew my expectations loved the first episode for me it was the best first episode from mcu disney series definitely deserved 10 stars dont understand why there is hate going on for this such beautiful light hearted show ', ' you know what don waste your time here disappointing doesn even sum it up only got 3 episodes in and gave up ve had more entertainment going to the dentist getting my tooth pulled out ', ' daredevil one of the best shows the year action sequences inspired from various movies like oldboy are great the plot keeps you completely invested you don hate any of the characters everyone gets their proper share of the screen the villain does what he needs to do he scares the crap out of everyone whenever he is on screen but at the same time he stays in the gray zone he is not out and out bad guy his character is best described by the story he tells at the end of the season episode he believes he is the savior that the people need and the biggest plus of the show there are no forced relationship or personal drama like in arrow and flash the only problem with the show is that you don feel like the hero is blind especially when not in costume the way others nod at him and he smiles at them looking at exactly where they are standing or acknowledges their response reaction there are couple of scenes where he is sitting in front of using normal laptop except for this small flaw daredevil is marvel best on screen adaptation in either tv or movie till date ', ' dont know what they were thinking while making this movie the generic direction and fight scenes are so bad the script is awful and clearly focusses in lazy written jokes instead of focussing in character development for character that have been waiting 10 years ', ' when it comes to the best actors screenplays characters and much more there is no series other than deardevil my personal opinion is that this series is the best in marvel even better than loki ', ' mild spoiler for spider man no way home never watched this show but knew who daredevil was and had seen charlie cox portraying him me being an idiot always thought netflix shows might be in the mcu but are they really the mcu absolutely when saw daredevil in spider man nwh and watched him catch that brick thought damn that was badass started the show that night and boy was blown away they got everything right the tone the stakes the character and his motivations it perfect and in this day and age of marvel shows on disney and can safely say that this this is the best marvel show ever made they could bring back iron man in show and d still call this the ultimate mcu television show ', ' great action great story the new characters introduced were good as well it was worth the spent ', ' went into this movie expecting to be bored and uninterested as black widow has historically been misused character however was so interested throughout this movie and am thrilled that black widow got an amazing send off ', ' marvel really lowered their standards on this one expect this sort of quality from dc but not from marvel might as well give the girl wand and let her say you re watching disney channel as she draws mickey mouse head on the screen ', ' after reading all the bad reviews gave ms marvel go and was pleasantly surprised this is very well done really enjoyed it think the bad reviews are coming from people mad at disney for standing up for all people this show is an amazing representation not only for pakistani but for all young people very much look forward to watching the entire series and seeing her in the movies with captain marvel ', ' loki tom hiddlestone is the main reason re watch this movie from time to time not even robert downey jr is worth the sacrifice of watching this silly movie than it is worth to watch loki the only good role that tom hiddlestone ever had if have to make top list put loki in the number one the second must be captain american butt the third captain america the fourth rdj the rest of the characters are boring and hate black widow it is the feminists before feminism went mainstream simple human who is there because they needed woman in the team no matter if she has superpowers or not ', ' don dislike the character read the initial run of the comic which was reminiscent of early lee ditko spider man stories and that was pretty good but something has gone wrong here it comes across more as show you would see on nickelodeon than and mcu project its very much aimed at the teen ya audience it just doesn have the qualities you would expect from the mcu m bit of mcu completionist got to episode 4 of this and about half way through thought this just isn entertaining me and gave up on it hence the one star by far the worst mcu show to date hampered by poor stories and bad acting it could have been and should have been so much better real disappointment ', ' probably the 2nd worst mcu movie made mean what even was this monstrosity of movie almost beat eternals as the worst mcu movie god was just begging for it to be over in my watchthrough cgi was bit lame action scenes were boring as all hell and what was up with that lame taskmaster they ruined his character so bad also is there even point to this since what happened to black widow in avengers yeah no the only redeeming thing about this horrible movie was red guardian he was funny guess don waste your time on this there loads of other fun mcu movies out there but if you re completionist like me then go ahead and give it watch but other than that skip this one ', ' ve been waiting for show like this for years ve been crazy about the whole concept of the punisher ever since saw frank castle in daredevil to make one show completely focused on him is the best thing that could have happened really missed this feeling of getting so addicted to something that simply can stop watching ', ' as the review says for 1 they changed her powers 2 the acting is horrible 3 feel like m watching childrens show m sorry seen it received good reviews but isn this little stealing from shang chi bangle that was not protected and left in box has powers ms marvel can stretch naturally and she tall and tad bit skinnier not to be body shaming have been watching marvel cartoons reading comics and have seen every marvel movie and show to date this is garbage especially after we just had moonknight ', ' having seen all of the other marvel films that lead to this film and being huge marvel fan was very excited to see this movie feel that this movie is very good and totally worth the wait loki comes to earth and uses the tesserect and his magical powers to try to take over mankind shield decides to put into action the avengers plan and recruits bruce banner iron man and captain america to join black widow on team of the best on the earth thor also joins with the team later as the planet is still under his protection this film has great flow to it it starts off with loki coming to earth and then goes into each member of the avengers joining the team it really started strongly and totally forgot about thor and then he joins the team too so lot going on that liked early which is important to film like this all of the members of the avengers are very good robert downey jr is great once again as stark iron man chris evans does good job as captain america but think he was missing something tho hemsworth is amazing as thor again like jeremy renner as hawkeye but feel that something was missing from that character as well maybe its cause im pretty big hawkeye fan thought mark ruffalo was ok but really liked the hulk and scarlett johansen is good and her behind is amazing as far as acton goes this may be one of the best films have ever seen in that regard tons of great action scenes in this film that cant do justice trying to speak about you ll just have to take my word for it the only real complaints have are that loki and his army he uses to attack earth aren well explained think loki is good but he just doesn come across as formidable villain in this film or one that people even fear cant really say too much more about this without giving lot away great movie great action and characters highly recommended ', ' don usually open my mouth until water really get over my head well will not waste my or your time to right story here total waste of time there are lots of good series if you really want to watch something ', ' solid movie across the board enjoyed it immensely while in the theater but looking back two months later it was one of those movies that could live without having to see again and scarcely remember any of the fine details which make movie truly stand out and be an all time great it was very good film and they really nailed the hulk this time especially robert downey jr is still an excellent iron man and despite the disappointment of iron man 2 in comparison to the first one which is my all time favorite marvel movie it was still very good don believe the avengers fully lived up to its massive hype but still good entertaining and action packed movie that most comic book and superhero fans should enjoy ', ' why are critics digging this movie for everything good in it because it vice versa for every other movie out there usually critics bash movies for their mistakes blind spots that ruin the movies why not here can name over ten things that make this movie so bad comedy in the end of the world are you kidding me loki villain for six people are you kidding me iron man is way too perfect as he is in every movie there is black widow is pathetic excuse for heroine along with hawkeye who even jenner said wasn good at all was the worst character of 2012 and yes did see most of the movies from the 2012 area this movies is nothing but generic version of batman begins and say that one rather than nolan other two because frankly in my opinion saying this generic version of the dark knight or the dark knight rises would make me go to hell for bad respect towards some of the best movies ever why can marvel fix their villain problems mandarin was terrible in iron man 3 especially that terrible twist anyways could continue but you get my point hulk had no veins this movie was cut from 3 to 2 hours and if it would have been 3 hours it would have gotten me to give it ten out of ten stars sorry if you take this as lecture m just listing why did not like this movie ', ' if you like lawyer series mixed with super heroes then you are right here didn like the movie daredevil so was afraid that the series would maybe be boring too but god thanks this wasn the case like this trio karen foggy and charlie karen did great job here ', ' like the actors in this film but they play characters that are flatter than piece of paper the purpose of film is to tell story thus is just one long fight scene with zero character development or plot had to shut it down half way through ', ' enjoyed watching this many years later after seeing it in theaters years ago m not sure if it was better than my original impression of it the second time around or if many of marvels post end game blunders make this appear better relative to them ve also seen brie larson more since then and ve grown more accustom to her style for the majority of the movie the story is decent and don mind the character interactions between fury and vers carol talos also is pretty good for the role he plays the ending however is poorly planned and completely ridiculous there was some character development within captain marvel but she out of nowhere just becomes totally overpowered and can destroy anything she wants with her power at the end of this movie she could have easily taken on thanos on her own they definitely overdid it now that m reminded of the skrulls story on to secret invasion ', ' it was good movie more realistic with short story which is little bit eloberated but still it was worth watching am now wondering why bad reviews are here seems like mcu haters got organised ', ' bernthal did such an amazing job with the character in daredevil that he absolutely had to have his own show the punisher overshadowed everyone as an anti hero the punisher hasn had as much success as other marvel characters he would make occasional appearances in archies too the black costume with the menacing skull along with the tag of the punisher was enough to assume some heavy duty punishment the netflix series draws brilliant story to the character it does not rush it lets you relish the violence when it is unleashed when frank smashes in skulls the sound effects made me feel like fruit was being squished it was hardcore bernthal breathes life into the character the slow angry growl and the limited facial expressions gives frank the feel of beast his smiles doesn come easy but when it does you sympathise with him you understand his pain his need for justice his objective to punish frank castle in on mission can wait for the next season ', ' feel bad for scarlett and her sister in this why oh why don american movies get real foreigners to play the foreigners ray winston is utterly awful as russian ', ' clearly not for kid mcu tv series just got lot deeper and meaningful all the characters in the second season are so full and very well portraited the story line is painfully good and feel for everybody in it jessica become very adorable on this season too ', ' please don let all the snark and whining about this film scare you it was great it a fun fast paced action packed classic comic book type movie that doesn take itself too seriously it also grounded with ton of heart in many ways each marvel is coming to terms with who they are was throughly engaged with the characters the three marvels are very charming and endearing and cannot wait to see more of them individually and together the movie actually made me laugh and smile as opposed to the overly heavy dark depressing and broody movies that have dominated the mcu for over decade and the khan family is great watch the marvels on friday or saturday night with popcorn relax and be entertained tip it helps to have watched the movies and tv shows that lead into it captain marvel wandavision and ms marvel before watching this which had it time for marvel movies to be fun again which this undoubtedly is watch for yourself and enjoy ', ' what waste of time other than the first episode of season 2 thanks to the cute bartender the show is complete waste of time what could be fit into 2 hour movie was prolonged for 2 seasons really made me reconsider watching tv series at all it would probably be better to swtuch to movies only tv series are just not worth it and ratings are no indication at all ', ' as the 1 streaming giant netflix continues to evolve from buyer of content to creator of original content the number of compelling shows not found anywhere on your tv channel guide continues to amass have been dedicated fan of house of cards tried and then passed on orange is the new black enjoyed their rendering of season 4 for both the killing and longmire as well as several of their self produced documentaries which brings us to one of their latest offerings marvel jessica jones given that am not much of fan for superhero genre had reservations about the show and story until learned the krysten ritter was slotted to play the lead character know little about her acting background other than she was stunning with tinge of sadness as the love interest to the jesse pinkman character during season 2 of breaking bad as jessica jones she plays broken but still fighting against evil former superhero turned private investigator her character and story is formed slowly and as the pieces come together we begin to understand the mystery behind why she is abrasive and yet compassionate afraid and fearless direct and then sometimes reticent her internal conflict evolves from having to come to gripes with dark and troubling past life as superhero in short the superhero backdrop offers plot vehicle to form engaging and moving story about the human condition while ritter may be early in her acting career she carries this show with ease and conviction and her ability to emote and pull you into her sad and conflicted story has turned this show into one of my current favorites as she builds her career as private investigator the cast of other characters that complete the background of the story amass and the framework of her internal battle is fleshed out in such way that the puzzle begins to take shape the pieces start to fit together and are colorized and subtleties are added such that by the latter part the first season found myself surprised to be hooked and caring what happens next while giving props to several other important characters in the show jessica jones is clearly vehicle for krysten ritter to shine and add necessary piece to her acting resume with the exception of jennifer carpenter blunt and foul mouthed sister in dexter hold ritter in close 2nd as the most watchable female actress on video today in short as long as the story line and dialogue continues to hit the same high mark as season 1 this show has the possibility to be ratings giant for netflix and offer another reason to keep watching ', ' can believe ve wasted good chunk of time waiting for this to release ', ' wow it has finally arrived marvel has had one hell of project coming up with movies exploring the origin stories of some of the most iconic superheroes of all time while adding small but subtle connections to each other as way to show fans what is coming over the horizon the result is an all out marvel mash as earth mightiest heroes have come together to face threat no one hero could possibly face alone they are the avengers loki the god of mischief has come to conquer the earth with an unspeakable alien force to back him up to make matters worse he has obtained an ancient artifact with virtually limitless power as his disposal in desperation nick fury director of the peace keeping organization h e d assembles together the greatest heroes the world has ever seen captain america iron man thor black widow hawkeye and the incredible hulk if these extraordinary independent individuals can learn to work together their combined might be enough to conquer this global threat this is every comic book geeks dream team and dream movie the faces we have all grown up with and come to love finally together in one film normally such task is highly risky because not only do the filmmakers have to be faithful to the comics but also appeal to what the fans would want to see in the avengers not to mention avoid any plot holes thankfully this movie does it all plus more it is dare say it incredible the action scenes are some of the best in the superhero genre lots of shooting punching and of course smashing things get really insane and everything in sight gets totally destroyed as the forces of good and evil duke it out all the characters have practically equal back story interactions and amount of fighting even characters like hawkeye black widow and nick fury with this not one seems left out or doesn get enough of these elements dialog is written very well and there a surprising amount of comedy throughout the film and it hard not to laugh with it there lots of great moments and none of it seems the least bit corny in conclusion this will satisfy anyone especially the fans everything people hope to see is brought to life and it kicks serious butt with fantastic action scenes excellent special effects well written script cool music and surprisingly great comedy the avengers is sure to satisfy in every way on scale of one to ten would give this movie twenty it a shame can physically give such rating go check out this awesome flick and enjoy avengers assemble ', ' an average movie with bad humor much like family movie rather than the so called cinema same like most other marvel movies without much interesting storyline ', ' first falcon and ws and now this avengers needs editors who can help make movies more interesting can believe pid 30 for premier access and can believe movie with scarlett johansson can be so boring dreary ', ' have to press every time saw the character of skye the character was not bad at all but the person playing do not deserve it ', ' the story was too simplistic it is inappropriate for children because of that one scene and it just isn that engaging the plot leaves many gaps to fill not very well done ', ' flawless is heavy word for movie these days and coming from pure comic super hero fan it adds even more weight to it but yes this movie exceeded all my expectations by far didn have single mistake or awkward moment and have already watched it 2 times and am planning for 3rd soon from the dialog to the cast choices to the fight scenes it was celebration of marvel comic books that only guy like whedon could achieve but what about people that don read comic books or just don like super heroes that much well for them the avengers will be one of the best blockbuster movies this year and they will leave the cinema in pure exhilaration go watch this movie now if you haven already for some strange reason ', ' despite the fact that love nat really enjoyed the movie and will deffinetly watch it again my opinion ', ' loved the characters the history and especially scarlett johansson ', ' very interesting story is good real world action like everything in the serial ', ' you can think m jumping on the bandwagon or whatever you want this movie was amazing would give it 10 out of 10 if cobie smulders hadn been so poorly miscast go back to ted robin you don belong here would be hard pressed to find anything else wrong with this movie the best scenes are not when the avengers are working together to fight the enemy it when they re fighting each other with words hilarious or with weapons bad some might say the beginning of this movie starts out too slow and there isn enough action d say they are dead wrong dead wrong this is movie that doesn insult the audience by assuming that all they want are things to go crash and boom this is movie that cares about developing their characters and cares about an actual storyline sure they re all superheros but they re all also human don worry though there still plenty of action to go around and each of the characters in this movie pulls his and her own weight my only piece of advice is to first see captain america iron man at least the first and thor especially thor since the entire premise of this movie is based on thor brother loki tom hiddleston is ridiculously amazing in this movie avengers does good job of catching you up to speed if you haven seen these other movies or read the comic books which admittedly haven but would still recommend seeing them bottom line if had the money d be paying to see this movie in the theater every day ', ' this is nothing more that best of reel for each character based on episode they don do anything like have the actors writers or producers talk about the characters and their motivations it all just reused footage that is condensed version of their story extremely disappointing should have just released wandavision week early ', ' little two much action and fast cuts for me if you have short attention span this film is for you ', ' one of the biggest issues have with the show is that some episodes are really good and then the next episode is just plain bad it makes it really tricky to say how much liked it but as whole say that it was alright it was really just let down by couple of episodes because aside from those it was really decent series ', ' cheesey to the core balance was off and clearly trying to pull off big budget movie without having the actual budget fine for tv movie but not blockbuster ', ' stop spluttering round saying this doesn fits with you or very very childish should know it a heckin teenage drama if you don relate to it just leave ', ' what can say growing up was massive daredevil fan but in my later years fell from grace on that front after watching the first episode of daredevil though m all in acting was great was it perfect no but that like this whole review is an opinion thought charlie cox was great as matt murdock and seeing as haven seen elden henson since the mighty ducks days and the mighty he was also really good the action sequences were tense and honestly feared for matt life in some scenario which as you all know is damn near impossible when making superhero movie or television show mean mon are they ever really in trouble in this case it felt like he was ve heard some people have compared this to the likes of arrow and can see that but is that bad thing don get me wrong it definitely differs from arrow but the approach to the series is almost in the same vein again not bad thing all in all will be watching the rest of the series and will be patiently waiting for season 2 this show is truly sight to see unless your matt murdock no alright here my rating 8 8 10 superb ', ' when we look directly at the marvels one feeling dominates perceptions rush we have work with three protagonists and villain as well as several special appearances and they all need to fit together to fit throughout its duration if on the one hand the main trio did not need lengthy introductions these were carried out in captain marvel wandavision and ms marvel on the other hand the film seems not to know how to distinguish superfluous excess from an important sequence for character development motivations and the like everything is presented very quickly discussed very quickly and resolved very quickly director nia dacosta simply throws the characters into the action right away giving quick introductions to them highlight is the way kamala is presented taking elements from her series with small animation that shows how she got her powers and her fascination with captain marvel while at the same time showing what her youthful personality is like it fair to say that this also only works because of iman vellani charisma in the role yes the young woman who recently started her career as an actress still has areas to improve but the charisma and energy she brings to the film is undeniable as happened in her own series which despite being bad works partially thanks to the young actress in the moments in which it focuses on the protagonists the marvels brings back great positive point of the mcu so far the ability to create charismatic figures for the public to identify with and admire after all anyone who cried at the end of iron man or even fights online about black widow is because they found something captivating in the journey of these characters however the film also rescues the worst of marvel studios which is the superficial creation of villains and developments culminating in forgettable feature and we already know the reason for this contrast the eternal struggle between the creation of production with an authorial feel and the need to be another chapter in the next phase of the mcu in this context director nia dacosta has less blame for the registry than it might seem although the marvels overall is not good film the parts where the director managed to put her vision of the story are obvious resulting in rare captivating moments on the other hand there are very clear sections in which the production had to be cut or reshot to add or remove something that will be used in the future so many changes also impact the technical part of the film although some of the fight choreography of the three protagonists is interesting there are bizarre moments in which the villain dar benn zawe ashton literally stands still waiting to be attacked before having any reaction the visual effects also have problems and are annoying in scenes that could easily be cut or thought of differently what we see here basically are poorly choreographed scenes that consist of characters releasing lightning and powers from their hands at each other with almost never any more physical and visceral fight it is the total pasteurization of the action filmed on green screen without any emotion or sense of urgency or threat in its entirety architecture clothing and customs are specific and original to each place and cheesiness is embraced without much embarrassment in this context cgi becomes welcome device especially because it allows the viewer to truly immerse themselves in this universe allowing them to see in the light and not decipher in the darkness the heroines cultural clashes from there it is easy to forgive the inconsistencies that the marvels creates in the mcu the grief the wife and the crisis created by nick fury samuel jackson in the series secret invasion for example are completely ignored in this production which in theory would be continuation of the series in fact as much as it is connected to three other titles captain marvel wandavision and ms marvel the film manages to stand on its own legs giving the basic context to understand the origin of the dilemmas of its trio of heroines it an adventure with beginning middle and end without any major rough edges and that delivers what it promised in just over an hour and half do you understand how out of line this is for marvel in recent years it is also surprising to note how the film script is not that interested in themes about representation unlike works like black panther and its sequel she hulk and even danvers own solo film the marvels is an extremely unpretentious and light adventure from the studio without so much interest in cultural discussions of gender and social commentary the most notorious and ridiculous thing we see here is the infamous use your power as black woman uttered by nick fury at certain point in the production totally out of place and making us wonder which of the genius minds of the women responsible for the script came up with the idea for this surreal moment in production trying to combine action with comedy and drama dacosta tries to innovate at marvel studios by adding musical touch as kind of narrative comic relief but without any really effective connection with the central plot the theatricality expressed in two original songs one of which is still sung by brie larson herself remains adrift like loose and lost cut within the film and this is clear evidence of the film lack of narrative synergy trying to navigate different genres the filmmaker debuts in the mcu with good intentions but doesn quite know how to execute them and that one of the biggest problems with the marvels made up of cuts that are sometimes pure children comedy and sometimes migrate abruptly to drama the long awaited sequel to captain marvel lacks harmony and balance his fun and funny takes work in isolation but are lost within the work as whole having difficulty focusing on her plot the director tries to embrace different approaches but never delivers anything completely the lack of focus on the text and narrative format makes the second act silly mishmash which does not compromise the audience entire experience due to the dynamic between brie larson teyonah parris and iman vellani and if velani enchants immediately and sustains this charm throughout the entire 105 minutes the uniform she gets on the planet aladna is unbelievably dark even though the colors reflect her constant state of mind which contrasts with the uniform of muted colors that danvers receives the cgi is perfectly acceptable but nothing particularly special which also has the advantage of the heroines having light powers which makes everyone job easier but what really doesn work at all is the villain remember the already fairly dull ronan the accuser lee pace from the first guardians of the galaxy well the supremor dar benn who also uses hammer or universal weapon as danvers explains to kahn is the no budget version of it and the problem isn even in the basic motivation for her to create chaos in the film but rather how generic she is in every aspect in uniform that looks more like it came from cosplay event or an episode of the power rangers series the makeup passing through the dialogues and their null depth furthermore zawe ashton is frighteningly bad in the role making faces mouths and gestures as if she were acting in play but without even managing to establish sense of threat she even embarrasses others every time she appears on the scene the marvels is the worst marvel movie during its almost 2 hour duration the film even tries to explain why the new threat of the week is so important with the already well known marvel dialogues full of difficult and barely understandable words but this does not translate into real dangers there is an attempt to give emotional weight to the characters and their relationships but this falls apart when things that seem so important disappear in the blink of an eye thus it is easy to reach the end of the marvels without understanding very well how we got there for the viewer there is that bitter feeling of having seen film that in addition to having no emotional weight and filmed almost entirely in chroma key with effects well below those expected for million dollar marvel production disappoints in every other way the film tries to insert drama but fails it tries to insert comedy and only few scenes actually work like the cats swallowing people and floating in the air it tries to insert adventure which never works with fights that border on the ridiculous because they are so poorly handled it even tries to be musical but this passage is embarrassing on several levels it another generic film stuck in formula that has already become saturated to disguise it it tries to insert something of greater relevance to the future of marvel in cinemas at the end such as the young avengers and even the men but this nod does not save the marvels from being disaster bringing three bland female characters that no one cares about the catastrophic result at the box office is proof of this for those who wanted female representation on the big screen they only received film that is pure embarrassment and that even ignores events from the series and other films without the slightest shame or weight on their conscience it a film that even when entertaining suffers most of the time the feeling that remains is that marvel needs to stop wanting to insert representation at any cost down its audience throats remembering that more than 90 of those who go to see the films and buy comics are men and urgently reinvent itself by bringing in top tier characters back or it may be heading in direction of no return ', ' wanna watch the whole show of that tv pilot slattery did one of the weaker one shots but still funny watch because of slattery interesting plot twist as well at the end ', ' there is nothing good in the movie just vomit of cgi on the screen like it a transformers movie there is zero creativity from the filmmakers bad acting bad music boring actions scenes and horrible script black widow should have been dead in the 26 minute mark on the bridge but the filmmakers slit the throat of logic through antier movie the lead characters are presented as the good guys and they are far from being acceptable people ', ' the avengers by many people called the movie of the year the epic combination of all the creatures and superheros who have had their own movies during the last decade one thing is for sure the film has visual effects quite lot of them and by lot mean lot in almost every scene there some cgi whether it a gigantic hulk or flying iron man two and half hours of thrilling action stunts huge floating ships creatures from another world and more so think speak for everyone who has seen this movie that visually this is one of the best movies ever made it a great movie to watch on the big screen in 3d with bag of popcorn on you side the people who created the world of the avengers have done an outstanding job it really overwhelming but there so many so many fights so many stunts so many creatures al packed into one movie if you erase all the effects and the action there nothing left the dialog is lame and cheesy the characters are flat and boring the plot is simple and predictable it doesn leave you thinking and it certainly not surprising and intuitive only cared about the characters because knew them from previous movies there no real character development because the action is the most important aspect of the movie yes the movie has it funny and shocking moments but really emotional or deep it never goes it remains flat and focused on events and action until the by the way epic conclusion everything considered would say that if you loved the previous superhero movies and want to see how they come together and love visual effects you certainly don want to skip this one but don except masterpiece smart dialog and deep emotional scenes just lean back and maybe get another drink ', ' the bad guys are all white and or christian the good guys and law enforcement are all either female persons of color or muslim don need to be morally lectured to by my entertainment provider won watch any more of this schlock ', ' complete disservice to the black widow the russian accents are almost insulting the fight choreography is amateur most of scarlet fighting is cgi and the reason why becomes obvious when you see her actually fight the plot was hot garbage ', ' jon bernthal say it right now will always be the best version of the punisher that has ever been developed on screen like the show delivered all the blood gore all out war that punisher fans just love like this show is the bomb so fun to watch with group of friends definetly not for the eyes of children haha but that up to you ', ' just skip it the 1st episode was good but since episode 2 the characters story and main theme are just like any other generic kids show the characters are all bland and boring ended up not caring about anyone the main character is narcissistic and self entitled her friends are stupid and no one think with his brain about anything again if you want to make teen drama do it but don add few superhero scenes and call it superhero show because it isn looks like the budget was so low that they saved the cgi budget but get that save the budget on cgi but at least use the budget to hire good actors ', ' black widow families surrogate ones appear in all shapes and sizes in this film but they are all unhappy in their own ways 1995 the original black widow melina vostokoff rachel weisz and red guardian alexi shostakov david harbour are undercove spying on shield accompanied by their young daughters natasha and yelena they flee when their cover is blown yelena and natasha are sent to the red room to be trained as black widow assassins so begins the tale of how this family reunites with scarlet johansson as the adult natasha and florence pugh as yelena they fight cyborg and the black widows as well as each other at first they even have to spring alex from prison fight scenes both mass and duels are impressively choreographed with cgi assistance in skydiving bouts the evil general dreykov ray winstone even has cloud base hq and as many lives as cat moving tale the sisters aren just out for revenge they want to free all of the black widows from mind control some gaps in the chronicles of the mcu are filled in and future adventures are promised with some interesting plot twists directed by cate shortland from script by eric pearson 8 10 ', ' get back to the comics get back to the basics bring back the personalities that were in the comics put on the screen what stan lee put in the books there an endless supply of stories already there ', ' will get right to it started kinda mediocre with the exception of agent coulson characters are predictable uninteresting the cases are with the exception of couple boring to laughable still watched nine episodes having high hopes as have seen number of series starting slowly but developing into great shows but episode after episode this was getting worse and finally number nine did it it is pure nonsense just don want to watch this anymore and loved avengers and love science fiction and superhero stuff in general disappointing ', ' it really great to see show experimenting with style and expression while also expanding culture and age we have all these older characters hard stories death loss despair new worlds dancing starlords magically brain controlled villages spiderman wearing ironman tech really so many visions ha for what possible this is just one more step forward love the creative way imagery of signs and drawings and walls carry so much exposition without making extra dialogue necessary love the teen hopes and dreams when you think hero can solve it all and make it better despite the culture and religion difference from what grew up in found the main character to be extremely relatable in every way some of it may be targeted to younger audience the teens in my family appreciated this more than some of the other marvel movies glued to their seat watching it actually but that just smart drawing the younger audience in and they will grow up with marvel movies over time so overall full stars fills gap and bridges age culture and other divides and does it with pop and imagination can wait for more edit ep 2 just keeps getting better more about the characters and what makes them keep going not all heroes are athletic and awesome you can tell there going to be lot of growing up in the story arc for more than one character nothing is thrown in your face and they show the multiculturalism and immigration issues without making huge fuss line here or there isn a fuss it just acknowledgement of real life issues my only complaint that the pool dive was so dangerously glamourized don try this one at home kids seriously don can wait for episode 3 ', ' watched it after the iron fist while didn liked iron fist and was about to skip the whole defender series but daredevil made me change my mind story telling and acting was good loved the characters except for karen page she almost made me skip episodes in daredevil wish for another season ', ' absolute garbage woke bs useless superhero it would have made absolutely no difference to the mcu and marvel comics at large had kamala khan not existed her powers are not that special this just wokism stunt and nothing else the sole purpose of kamala khan is to increase racial diversity in the mcu other than that she pretty useless ', ' really wanted to love this movie am huge fan of the marvel movies even though know nothing about the comics left this movie twice feeling meh the second time went was hoping to feel differently but still meh loved the 90s aspect and the fury character but just didn feel much for carol wanted to but couldn connect the movie has great action and humor and she definitely kicks butt but it just lacking something the acting is great and am excited to see where her character goes in the future ', ' love this show but cannot stand the mac character so it always going to get lower points while whinging and whining mac is on the show ', ' think ms marvel started out pretty good with introductions of family and friends what hurt the show is episode 4 5 the bad guys and too little episodes for one season to fully flush out the characters and grow organically without rushing into the last episode to wrap things up ', ' this is it this is what the nerd world has been waiting for for so long almost every marvel movie since iron man has been alluding to this film and we ve all been so anxiously awaiting the first assembly of the avengers marvel ultimate superhero alliance the avengers unites iron man thor captain america black widow hulk and hawkeye making them superhero team of epic proportions all brought together by nick fury the film tells the story of the forming of the avengers as they are forced together in order to stop loki thor mischievous brother from waging an intergalactic war on earth the ensuing battle is one that strives to be of epic proportions to say that the avengers lived up to its hype would be giving it too much credit to say it is letdown would be too harsh with the recent quality of superhero movies the avengers was about as good as you could expect it a little simplistic doesn go too deep yet it stands to be hell of lot of fun and there nothing wrong with that after watching the slew of superhero movies that have come out in the last 3 or 4 years this is what we have been waiting for and it essentially doesn let us down it what we want to see when watching all these great superheroes come together to fight the forces of evil the action is great and they dynamics between our diverse cast of heroes are excellent it is almost requirement that you watch the previous marvel movies to fully understand the relationships developing here such as loki significance and why exactly he is after the tesserac an artifact that can open portals to different worlds yet at the same time there is lot of undeveloped story for some of the other characters black widow and hawkeye are the two that most come to mind black widow appeared multiple times in the iron man films and we got feel for her there but hawkeye was only treated to about 30 seconds of screen time in thor yet in the avengers we have to assume lot of information about his character as we don get to learn much about him it almost feels as if there should have been hawkeye movie released before this one however this hawkeye dilemma highlights one aspect of the film that can be good for some and bad for others there is lot going on in this film and it has to move very fast even for two and half hour film this is the reason the story is kept fairly simple and the bulk of the film focuses on bringing together the film ensemble and of course the action which is nothing short of awesome you can expect great explosions awesome fights and breathtaking cgi throughout the whole film and while it is nothing exceptional it makes the avengers what it is summer blockbuster the avengers isn the superhero film to end all superhero films but it is certainly lot of fun there no reason you shouldn enjoy the film if you sit back and relax and watch the excitement unfold ', ' enjoyed the movie good characters and character development action sequences effects pacing and world building more than one good twist bit darker than other marvel movies so probably not good for younger audiences an exciting ride that keeps you guessing scarlet was excellent good luck with the lawsuit ', ' didn get past season 1 episode 5 couldn bear the sheer stupidity of the characters anymore especially jessica feels like umbrella academy you have group of heroes or wanna be heroes who do one stupid thing after the other literally nobody with an ounce of intelligence in their brain would act like they do as viewer consider this insulting come up with better story make your villains smart and challenging instead of making the heroes look dumb every 5 seconds ', ' the most recent portrayal of the punisher came via netflix when jon bernthal the walking dead actor signed on to play frank castle this version of punisher first appeared in the second season of daredevil but he found his footing in his lone season bernthal was excellent in his performance as castle and the show was one of the best non daredevil shows on netflix for marvel second season also hit in 2019 and that was it before marvel left netflix bernthal widely considered the best live action punisher is nothing short of exceptional as frank castle so much so that fans are begging for his return in the mcu yes please we need few more seasons and cross overs cross overs with daredevil and other defenders that would be awesome disney lets get to work on these ', ' if you watch this film through window of political agendas you probably won like the marvels if you don it just harmless fun slightly scatty marvel chick flick on the plus side it not jaws 2 re run but good sequel and story continuation due to the additional cast and backstory each character brings there also much more relatable carol danvers rather than the completely invincible character seen to date and revenge story so simple child could follow it although wasn clear how civil war on hala caused problems with their sun whilst slightly gross using the flerkens as means of emergency transport makes perfect practical sense to the mind of an engineer and the accompanying music from cats was nice comedic touch on the downside it could have done without the singing planet sequence the cgi is dodgy in places and the pacing is sometimes uneven this could be related to the reported production problems and reshoots but the fight scene with the skrulls in kamala house went on too long and the ending seemed rushed imo compared to others in the recent run of underperforming female fronted films the marvels is probably the best out of the lot ', ' m huge marvel fan and this was such disappointment was bored and my mind drifted lot during it it feels rushed and made with no love really didn care for the character at all or root for her even sam jackson coldn redeem it total letdown and definitely the low point of the mcu ', ' this movie rocks ve been waiting for this movie for 37 years joss whedon nailed it the action is paced just right with good amount of one liners to keep it light robert downey jr has lot of fun as tony stark the story works well and the actors sell their roles with ease wasn sure about mark ruffalo as bruce banner he did alright but he a little too beefy to be bruce all the other actors have played their characters before and this just cements their position this movie is better than any of the solo hero movies that led up to it hopefully joss comes back for the next one and can pull it off again saw the imax 3d version and while it looked and sounded fantastic the 3d didn pop as much as it could have it had some depth but it didn really add much it should make substantial amount at the the box office and should get few nods for the oscars but we all know that won happen the academy always passes over movies like this just want to state again this is great movie action packed and hilarious ', ' when we learned we were getting black widow movie didn expect family drama but it was the perfect choice spy thrillers are dime dozen did we really need another this was so much better scarlett johansson always shines brightest in truly dramatic roles apparently natasha does too because she never shined brighter from her dealings with her long lost family to the way she handled her adversaries we got to finally understand what makes natasha tick and why she truly was the glue holding the avengers together the pacing was great enjoyed the hand to hand and even the cgi stuff mandatory for marvel blockbuster but the family moments made the movie it all heart no one showed more heart than the star herself while many actors might have been tempted to use the executive producer title to insure themselves the spotlight scarlett opted to use hers to just make the best movie possible even setting up bright future for those who take her place she surrounded herself with first class talent and made sure everyone had chance to shine my only complaint is that this will be our last black widow movie with natasha front and center but m willing to wager all the infinity stones at the tva that black widow 2 will have scarlett johansson name listed among the executive producers this was perfect send off for beloved character ', ' ve been watching this series since the beginning and now it over was teenager when this show started now am an adult the first few episodes thought it was gonna be boring however it growth every season and it ended with an amazing finale we have seen all of these characters changing learning every season with great plot thank you guys for 7 good years ', ' ve watched this show so many times and it amazing by far my favorite show of all time phil is just hero and skye daisy is amazing much love for this show ', ' it started slowly in season 1 but d heard so many positive accounts of the writing that persevered wow it amazing the character development the plot twists the reveals the twists and turns the drama the fight sequences the effects the acting the whole story it truly awesome if you watched season 1 and gave up heartily recommend you get back to it and watch to at least season 2 and you ll be hooked there are plenty of moments where ve laughed out loud plenty moments where ve almost cried plenty times when ve shouted at the screen it full of drama adventure action suspense and even comedy no spoilers just watch it of all the television shows ve watched it definitely in the top 10 maybe even the top 5 give it go if the imdb review scores were ignored from 2013 this would be scoring 9 0 or higher instead of the measly 7 5 it currently undeservedly has ', ' jon killed it great action scenes that girl in second season is very annoying and bad actor ', ' summary season 2 is genuinely horrible you ll hate every single character you ve once loved on season 1 personally would rather watch 20 hours of jake paul videos than to rewatch this ', ' when you see most of the people staring at their phones half way through the movie it just shows how extremely bad this movie is ', ' why why the low ratings dunno what other people were thinking about but the movie is literally awesome it kinda amused me please don bother yourself with bad reviews just watch it ', ' this was so slow and boring had loved the punisher outing in dare devil dd he was all explosive there gory and fun were his trademark well we do have gory here but it not very often it the pacing and script that have problem with the show had good materials for about for 4 6 episodes but they dragged the series up to 13 episodes with tedious pacing and unwanted fillers the stupid script kind of destroyed the cool image of punisher dd had built up this was supposed to be the most realistic of marvel series with no superpowers and the action sequences being believable well dd jessica jones were more convincing jon bernthal shines as the punisher he is perfect he is the only saving grace of the show but by himself not enough the rest of the casting was mediocre at best some of them were outright terrible ', ' lol this can be marvel show this is pure cringe plus unnecessary over acting and more important thing is this isn for adults it for child would ve been better if disney made this ', ' real shame the character and episode is mired in the current politics of the day what happened to making shows that wwre non political why do producers writers insist on catering to the narrative of one side or the other cant we just go back to apolitical story lines and narratives ', ' ve seen better movies from 2021 imo black widow was ok honestly have nothing much to say it would ve been good if it launched around 2017 guess but now that see it it was ok not bad the sister relation the unreal family and an old foe review its ummm ok ', ' enjoyed this short film although it only went for about 6 minutes it still showed lot of attention to detail and that what really liked about it they could of been lazy with the writing or the hd work but they weren and that why it was great short film ', ' loved this first episode the main character is instantly charming and likable high school and family burdens are lovely break from the drama of big mcu and heavy netflix trauma in hero dash of the mitchells the machines vibe and kim connivence 2nd gen immigrant foundation gives heartfelt smart and fun world for marvel to expand in the avengers con montage is top notch true to the heart of the original comic kamala khan is awesome the credits give nod to the inspirational original art left off one star only because her powers diverge so much from the book and still have weird fx unexplained quality hopefully solved as the series goes on for now love love love ', ' this is disappointing it not good indication that the lawsuit its star scarlett johansson brought against disney is more interesting than the movie black widow itself it could ve been different it could ve been movie without any future in the marvel cinematic universe of endless sequels like its deceased avenger who not even an avenger at this point of prequel like the sterilization the character was forced to undergo in her past the selection of genetically gifted and trained life free from subjugation with an individual identity free will beyond procreation and the cycle of slavery rebellion and slavery again alas disney and marvel have no interest in quality stand alone productions they care about setting up the next episode about copyright extended brands fecund intellectual property that may reproduce ad infinitum johansson contract may be finished but as the villain says women are the one resource of the world in overabundance disney is that villain it shouldn take an incompetent publicity statement in response to lawsuit to figure that out heck it almost seems intentional that the villain resembles harvey weinstein and disney did own miramax at one point despite the mcu having only two female led superhero installments out of what 25 movies now and having still let the shambolic dceu beat them to the punch with the first one wonder woman 2017 not to even count the two such dc movies before this cinematic universe stuff m not saying disney is particularly misogynistic m not saying that here at least the corporate disdain for people is more general than that people are the abundant resource and they re in markets across the globe look at the generic map on the screen as the also generic bond villain elaborates on his evil soviet hydra plan think the tvtropes website calls this the spreading disaster map graphic trope it might as well be disney distribution blueprint plant these widows of no free will around the world to wreak havoc effect the stock market an such speaking of tropes too the outcry over supposed fridging of black widow in endgame 2019 was silly but they really did it this time and in her own movie had the filmmakers realized and intended this it be different story but suspect as with the scenario of sleeper cells and the antidote freeing them for movie released during pandemic it was happenstance albeit jac schaeffer wrote the story here and she was the head writer behind the intelligently reflexive wandavision 2021 tailor made for its episodic tv medium not this time though the results are merely the usual mcu junk at lower stakes and the fight choreography is literally mirrored as is the rest with lot of the winter soldier 2014 recycling like shield another secret lair in the sky climaxing in jump that hardly even as impressive as when done at the beginning of iron man 2 2010 found family throughline that might as well have been ripped off from the maudlin guardians of the galaxy vol 2 2017 communists instead of nazis for the aforementioned ham fisted hydra variation even prison break and an avalanche and throw in some mission impossible while you re at you ll know what m talking about when you see it for crying out loud and an opening act that looks like it was made for tv but not even the tv that did it better e the americans mean look at those opening credits that a thematic tv show montage it hideous it not surprising that lot of the filmmakers behind this have tv experience heck they cast that guy t fagbenle who plays the sensitive man in the handmaid tale to essentially play the same role here and that other guy david harbour from stranger things where he plays the gallant father figure to superheroic girl does that again here too and that not even to describe the end credits scene rachel weisz is too good for this as is johansson so m glad she out how is this family bonding schmaltz supposed to be heartwarming anyways nonchalantly abandoning their children to be sterilized mind controlled and turned assassins for most of their lives but oh they spent three happy years together in ohio get out of here at least the sisterly bond works well enough and florence pugh black widow 2 mocking black widow being poser is the only joke here that lands heh get it besides the dysfunctional family junk isn even the most oblivious thing about another disney mcu corporatist abomination that pretends it solved another societal ill sexism this time racism and squatting or borders or something the outing before last with the falcon and the winter soldier 2020 throw 20 million at the problem that ll fix it right on second thought the worst thing about this might be that it also ruins the budapest mcu story we never got where now we re told that black widow and hawkeye spent days confined together in cramped quarters and what they did was play tic tac toe overbred but sexless that is unless counting the so called by laura mulvey that is male gaze despite female director with camera setups seemingly going out of their way to copiously focus on johansson posterior black widow exits the mcu the same way she entered it what pity ', ' iman vellani is wrong choice for ms marvel overacting most of the time kamala khan mother addressing her daughter all the time as kamala khan pathetic which mother will call their kid with their surname included all the time over use of bollywood songs makes it feel weird unwanted connection to partition period hopeless family drama doesn feel like marvel series their worst product yet ', ' was pleasantly surprised how much like daredevil didn like the motion picture with ben affleck the show has great flow really like the flashbacks of matt as child the flashbacks reveal lot about who the character is today this show reminds of arrow on the cw network the hero is hiding secrets from his closets friends while fighting crime at night the viewers can relate to the hero as man the hero has skills but is not using over the top gadgets to fight the enemy the show is not afraid to show daredevil taking beating it reminds us he is human just like us could definitely watch second season good job netflix ', ' well people are complaining how it not for them yeah obviously you re not the targeted audience btw liked the show but they could ve worked on the cgi ', ' daredevil is the best new show to grace our tv screens in the last couple of years whether you are comic book fan or not you will enjoy the passionate heartfelt drama and exciting action it intense and gritty but there moments of poetry and insight in the script there are characters that you will fall in love with marvel studios have worked miracle adapting this dark vigilante hero to tv the setting the streets of new york city is like another character while thor and co are off saving the world or the galaxy daredevil is stopping the thugs and low lives from hurting you and me it has real sense of place in the marvel universe ', ' could this be perfect programme quite possibly amazing writing amazing acting incredible action sequences and fight scenes cannot express how emotionally attached become with this show second time watching now first time was hooked this time it has confirmed for me that this is possibly the best of the best of anything under the marvel name fantastic viewing with twists and turns all the way ', ' was so enlivened by watching this great movie through the countdown for the new year 2022 hope we can see the happy end of the covid 19 pandamic soon in the 2022 ', ' core of the show is that we take our traumas experiences and the traumas experiences of our ancestors and draw strength from it we don give up we pick ourselves up and use the resources we have to build new life and better future for our community that what many pakistanis experienced when they my people migrated to present day pakistan building new life in new land and this is what we experience as immigrants in american society too and it what made us thrive in times of hardship thoroughly enjoyed the cultural aspects of the show really spoke to me as young pakistani american woman was very relatable and lot of funny jokes in it really appreciated how it touched on issues of islamophobia but not in way that makes us as community look helpless or shows muslims in negative way more so showing how we stick together in times of adversity and pick ourselves up also touched on women issues in muslim society as well our flaws as community which added authenticity and was well appreciated also appreciated the fact that they talked about the partition in very sensitive way as said in the show every pakistani as partition story and was happy they incorporated this as part of the show they did heavily water down the horror of it but that to be expected its triggering topic for pakistanis so can understand why the writers directors left looooooot out cried even with the way it is now so probably would have cried more if they deep dived into it but m also major cry baby so don expect it to move everyone for me personally am fine with the way it is else would have cried more lol took lot from this series it really made me think and process lot from my own experiences my heritage and the experiences of others in my community and their families its something watched with my family and friends and we enjoyed it since it was very relatable funny and emotional in good way and it opened line of conversation with everyone in my family tat made watching it good experience as noted in the show pakistanis especially elders don like talking about the partition so this was kind of icebreaker into that topic and provided me with some new perspective and insight from them imo it was 10 10 and id recommend it to everyone especially to those who are open to learning new cultures perspectives and those already of pakistani heritage ', ' my most trusted movie reviewers seem to dislike this film lot more than did sure it is formularic with some ridiculous plot armor on the protagonists but has many positives the action is tight the pacing is reasonable and the acting by florence pugh and david harbour are top notch the complaints that taskmaster was disserviced doesn resonate with me as non comic reader but feel for those that had poor portrayal of their beloved character overall the movie is fine to watch in theatres if you can look past some glaring plot holes and silly final moments ', ' athough the show was cancelled the cast and crew did phenomenal job and bernthal was electric to watch have grown out of mindless action as got older but when you see how brutal some of the punishments castle deals out kind of blows my mind applaude this show ', ' didn want to watch this movie because only really watch the avengers and spiderman movies and thought it would be just cliche marvel movie which it did end up being liked the plot and it kept me interested however was less interested towards the end as thought the ending was kind of cliche but that probably because ve seen so many action movies the actions scenes were good some of them were unrealistic at times which m not fan of but guess that normal in movies m not saying this movie is bad as actually did find it entertaining but it not one of those movies would reccomend as there are many more better movies especially in the marvel universe ', ' it the same movie at the same style it just rinse wash and repeat nothing original here main actors performance was plain rubbish she may be good at acting and has one or an award this isn her style definitely bad casting choice other actors such as samuel jackson and jude law good performances and hence the one star ', ' give this movie 1 strictly to balance out the ridiculous upvoting really find it annoying when people trying to lie and say movie is awesome when it really isnt if it werent for all the users giving this movie 8 or 9 stars then would put its actual imdb rating at 5 0 this movie is one of those long and boring action movies explosions and fights scenes can not make up for bad writing hollywood really needs to rethink how women are cast in traditionally male roles you can just put any actor in any role bad casting makes it difficult to believe the character and makes the movie hard to sit through every 15 minutes found myself checking how much time had left before this movie was over ', ' worst marvel movie its very cringy clicheyee weird storyline had to hardly tolerate this piece of garbage brie larson as always emotionless acting cant stand to her she is boring cant connect to her character but only hate watching her teyonah was good iman made me cringe everytime she appeared on screen have been watchng marvel movies since ironman and love everymovies but after endgame marvel is falling hard this movie is conceptless plotless sensless tasteless directionless pointless vfx was you know after endgame not good honestly this is disaster please stay aways from this but if you are still watching you are gonna enjoy just 2 of it ', ' first anyone who giving this 1 10 stars is every bit as delusional as people giving this 10 10 stars this show is neither that bad nor that good second don trust any review that was made prior to the show being completely aired review based only on one or two episodes is obviously not going to be accurate so what do think of the show after watching the entire season let me say it this way if you re looking for your stereotypical teenage sitcom where the lead has deal with balancing their family school life love life and sense of adventure this show won disappoint d say it above average compared to your usual sitcom but as superhero show it sucks there very little action to it the main villains are taken out with barely fight kamala doesn spend lot of time as ms marvel and there just isn a lot of focus on her superheroics there far more focus on her family religion and cultural heritage the writing and pacing is also wonky the main villains and main plotline are resolve in the 2nd to the last episode whereas the last episode is used to deal with the secondary villains there are entire episodes which felt like fillers and there are exposition dumps that could have used actual scenes to show them the lead actress is fairly charismatic and lovable but she struggles to deliver the heavier dramatic scenes or the more intense fight scenes great when portraying the average teenager not so great when portraying someone in distress overall d say this was the worst of the mcu movies it not trash ve seen worse shows out there but definitely not something to be proud of 4 or 5 stars is good rating for it ', ' when first heard about the avengers must admit to getting excited although had my doubts m big fan of the spider man trilogy love iron man at least the first one and could even enjoy thor being from sweden who wouldn right thor was definitely best served hung over and gave me exactly what expected the avengers did not don know where to begin with this movie it just one of those where you die little inside every time punchline is delivered alright samuel have earned his right to do just that but the rest of them have not it extremely predictable you see everything coming from miles away if you re expecting great story you would do best to rethink your choice of movie there is way to many heroes the story becomes messy tangle of too many stories and the only one making me laugh is stark iron man also they all seem to have the same strength all of sudden don get me wrong m not one of those guys getting annoyed by the impossibility behind superpowers but this is absurd all and all this movie is an orgy in special effects and superpowers and nothing more ', ' black widow was my favorite character in mcu after years of waiting we finally get the solo movie and it was good but not enough now we have to say goodbye to natasha with this movie we want more explanations from her life and her journey with hack eye and nick fury how she got in shield and become an avenger and her life before shield and her adventure in red room we deserve more this character has more potential marvel is introducing new characters without give us enough explanation about the old ones frankly this movie only show us how nat hair got blond in infinity war we need more ', ' pap that is all when are we going to good movie from hollywood marvel sucks ass ', ' started okay after that an onslaught of bad acting terrible jokes and terrible storyline was spewed out with terrible pace had some great actors in it to but goes to show you really need good director who isn influenced 100 percent by the studio ', ' everyone says it starts slow but found the beginning fit especially with the development of the characters over the seasons started watching this show 3 weeks ago and m already on the last season even when you don think the season or whatever is happening at the moment is going to mean something in the future surprise everything ends up meaning something eventually so pay attention the last season so far seems little dull m only on episode 4 so lets see if it takes turn definitely recommend this show to all my family and friends ', ' 8 10 fun team up that helped set the modern superhero genre into motion ', ' here is the movie they were preparing us for iron man captain america thor this was where they would eventually go and brother it didn disappoint joss whedon magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo and more capable direction and more taut script than most of the so called superhero movies made the movie featured an interesting mix of marvel heroes coming together as team when the earth is in crisis to save the world from spectacular intro where loki arrives unexpectedly at shield hq to the brilliant final showdown avengers is thrill ride never letting go this is the summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see lots of action lots of thrills superheroes and and badass villain every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction the one liners are numerous and never seem forced iron man quips are just as well timed as always enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions joss whedon has done remarkable job in adding huge wave of emotion that runs over the film iron man is the machine with heart who never shows it the hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it and most surprising of all black widow comes with beautifully nuanced performance all hints of fear love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions scarlett johansson is casting choice to be applauded as is mark ruffalo since now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role the only flaw could think up was the marvel universe as such don understand why the men weren considered for the avengers program legal rights to the characters issues but the movie is wonderful viewing experience and by all means treasure must see for the summer of 2012 ', ' thought the movie was great addition to the mcu it was light hearted the chemistry was great between the three leads and the action was creative and joy to watch it probably my second favourite movie after guardians 3 since end game it balanced humour and emotional scenes very well and had bits and pieces of exposition to explain the other connected projects that won leave you too left behind overall really enjoyed the movie and althought the villain was entirely forgettable everything else made up for it in the end quite literally because the credit scenes were surprise as didn read up on any spoilers beforehand ', ' finally waited for natasha personal movie although the action special effects in the movie can perform more and more but it is still necessary to describe the change in natasha personal mood it just that this is the script after taking the avengers in fact am looking forward to the most crisis other partners of the avengers will show up to help to add bright spot unfortunately didn wait for this scene so overall it complements part of natasha personal mood but she didn explain enough to be more complete so at the moment am looking forward to the next episode too much ', ' the characters are cheesy the story line is boring and the acting isn the best even my 10 year old said it boring we ve stopped watching after episode 3 disappointing for marvel it nothing like the other marvel series on disney ', ' wow where to even start with show this poor the writing sucks the characters are poorly written and surprisingly just as poorly acted the plot is so slooooow and stupid click off for 5 10 minutes at time and there is nothing to be missed it boringggggg most of the time we are just watching people give lectures to the main character or encouraging advice at one point 3 characters in 10 minutes had to all sit her down and so this we get it they even manage to make the biggest plot points like there is another dimension that has the potential to end the world so boring and mundane love marvel every film and every show even wandavision which was the weakest before this imo and will keep watching everything marvel until the day die will probably watch the rest of the season too because marvel will tie something else important in no doubt but it doesn mean will enjoy it this show sucks so bad ', ' this is clearly aimed at younger audience which is fine but hope older fans aren forced to watch this for plot point in the ongoing universe don really get the hype around this its full of ridiculous stereotypes and the lead is hardly super likable ', ' know lot of critics and fans loved this movie but unfortunately this movie just didn do anything for me my first biggest problem with this movie mark ruffalo was horrible as bruce banner it was like he was sleepwalking through the entire movie marvel fired edward norton and the best replacement they could find was this guy did they just pick his name out of hat come on my second biggest problem with this movie captain america gets pushed to the side and most of the focus is on iron man why here a crazy idea seeing as how captain america is the leader of the avengers why not give him the spotlight furthermore iron man and captain america hardly ever get along in this movie this wasn at all like it was in the comics in the comics tony stark deeply admired and respected steve rogers in fact tony stark father howard helped create the captain america program my third biggest problem with this movie it takes forever for the the avengers to come together and work as team throughout the movie all they do is fight most of the time and occasionally throw in corny joke can someone please tell me what purpose that serves other than to look cool if you like generic run of the mill superhero movies then give this watch however don expect this movie to be deep and meaningful because you will be sorely disappointed ', ' was searching online for any reviews about marvel knights eternals or any other marvel knights product couldn find much need to hear from people who approve of this animation wanted so badly for there to be spider woman and inhumans animated movie but all there is are these marvel knight productions are they supposed to be digital comics reminds me of that art ve tried to appreciate these half baked things but cannot where are the reviews of marvel knights shows because there needs to be want to find support in my distaste for them guess can appreciate the creativity and courage to produce and release them they certainly are different it like watching an animated storyboard of proposed project there must be some technical wizardry going on here that haven figured out can get into it can you there isn even cover image on imdb for this movie nor other marvel knights are they even recognized as finished product are they fan made projects rhetorical why are they so stupid ', ' as black widow 2021 release 134 min opens it is ohio 1995 as we see 2 little girls play when dad comes home he announces that the family needs to leave and leave right now dad mom and the 2 girls fly out and next we are in cuba where it is revealed that mom and dad were part of russian spy cell planted in ohio the 2 girls are separated from mom and dad at this point we are 10 min into the movie couple of comments let me state upfront that have never seen marvel universe film until now simply am not all that interested in all those superheroes movies but there was something about black widow that made me think this film might be little different and as it turns out ended up enjoying this quite bit there are several reasons for that great story line even though some of the marvel universe references were lost on me nice pacing of the movie with good dose of action scenes and some humor and some quiet er moments plus of course great all star cast headed by scarlett johansson florence pugh rachel weisz etc bottom line director cate shortland whose 2012 film lore was outstanding has delivered surprisingly solid and entertaining film that stands on its own within the marvel universe and am the very proof that one doesn need to have seen any of the previous marvel universe films to enjoy this one black widow was supposed to have been released in theaters in may 2020 covid 10 had other plans pushing the movie to july 2021 the sunday early evening screening where saw this here in cincinnati was attended nicely about 15 20 people keep in mind the movie has been out for 4 weeks mow if you like myself have never seen marvel universe film but are curious d readily suggest you check this out be it in the theater on vod or eventually on dvd blu ray and draw your own conclusion ', ' can believe saw something like this from marvel it is definitely the weakest work of marvel that have seen so far the choice of actors and the strength of the hero of the movie adam reminds me of weak indian comedies ', ' the worst hero in the marvel universe is daredevil he is boring hero his fights are bad he is selfish and unfunny person have never seen hero worse than him fisk also bad villain he just fat idiot dix was good villain season 2 is the best season because the punisher was in it ', ' its bad the toxic marvel fans should accept it not fool themself ', ' expected more from this movie natasha deserved better ', ' was highly anticipating this show only to be met by disappointment the foundation for masterpiece was there the casting is superb and the premise of super strength fighting mind control certainly set it up for success was expecting dark chilling psychological thriller bordering horror with protagonist who haunted by her past only to be thrown back into her worst nightmares and while the first episode was promising me such show it only went downhill from there it became one of those shows that muscled through only because was desperate to find out what happens in the end waiting for the story to finally rise to the occasion which it never did in the end believe it came down to poor writing the characters weren given the chance to show their full potential and with the lack of storytelling it became more of an unoriginal game of cat and mouse than anything filled with uninteresting subplot and mediocre dialogue what waste of an opportunity ', ' most of these reviews want to focus on the mcu or the politics of it all but this movie is just fun time and the power switching conundrum these heroes see themselves in is highly unique entertaining and done fairly well for how ambitious it is ms marvel kamala khan is an absolute gem m not surprised that she becoming much bigger part of the mcu and hope people get to see her in action one thing marvel star wars is going to give you with movies is polish say what you will but no other studio is consistently doing it as clean as they are this was way better than ant man quantum mania and great look at other heroes storylines in the mcu ']\n",
